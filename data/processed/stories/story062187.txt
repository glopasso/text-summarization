It could have been the premise of a "Modern Family" episode: Three cast members get stuck in an elevator and joke about it on Twitter.
Eric Stonestreet, Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Julie Bowen were visiting Stonestreet's hometown of Kansas City, Missouri, when their crowded hotel elevator stopped short of the third floor, according to CNN affiliate KCTV.
"I honestly handled being stuck in an elevator for 50min better than I thought," tweeted Stonestreet. "All @jessetyler did was pass wind."
The actors tweeted a photo of themselves in the elevator, and Ferguson also posted a short video at the 35-minute mark of the whole elevator shouting "Get us out!"
Kansas City firemen eventually came to the rescue and got everyone out with a ladder around 10 p.m. Friday, KCTV reported.
"Finally made it out of the stuck elevator at the one hour mark. At least the firemen in K.C. are cute," tweeted Ferguson.
The trio later visited Stonestreet's childhood home. As Bowen and Ferguson walked out, Stonestreet pelted them with a snowball.
"Apparently this is how you say bye in Kansas City," Bowen tweeted.
Ferguson and Stonestreet play partners Mitchell and Cameron on the Emmy-winning ABC sitcom. Bowen plays Mitchell's sister, Claire.
