For Miley Cyrus' 21st birthday on Saturday, she's getting the keys to MTV.
The network announced one of its favorite headline makers is going to run the flagship channel for eight hours, starting at noon ET Saturday.
The TV party will begin with "21 Candles: Miley's MTV Moments," an hourlong special highlighting "the 21 reasons why fans love the megastar, including Miley's best MTV moments of all time," the network said.
That hour will include snippets from the pop star's music videos and performances as well as comments from celebrities on their top Cyrus memories.
Afterward, the singer will re-air MTV's documentary about her, "Miley: The Movement Deluxe Edition," with new commentary and will also roll out episodes of her favorite MTV shows, "Snooki & JWoww" and "Awkward." Fans who Instagram or tweet birthday greetings using the hashtag #HappyBirthdayMiley could be included in the on-air festivities.
Cyrus hasn't mentioned anything about this new round of MTV shenanigans, but the singer/actress likely will sport her latest look -- bleached eyebrows -- as she rings in her 21st year.
