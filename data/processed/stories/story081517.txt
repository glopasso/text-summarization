World number one Novak Djokovic came back down to earth with a bump Thursday after being demolished 6-2, 6-2 by Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the third round of the Toronto Masters.
His honeymoon period following victory at Wimbledon and his recent wedding was quite literally over as he bowed out without even a wimper against the Frenchman, making 18 unforced errors and dropping his serve four times.
The defeat had been on the cards, though, after needing close to three hours to beat Gael Monfils in the first round.
"Congratulations to Jo," Djokovic told the ATP's official website after the defeat.
"He played some great tennis. Served very well. He was obviously the better player on the court. I hadn't played even close to what I intended before going to the court. Just nothing was going. No baseline, no serve, no return. Generally a very bad day, very poor performance. Couldn't do much."
The in form Tsonga now plays Andy Murray in the quarter finals, who will be fresher after his scheduled third round opponent Richard Gasquet pulled out injured.
It was a day of shocks after Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka was also knocked out 7-6 (10/8), 7-5 by South Africa's Kevin Anderson.
