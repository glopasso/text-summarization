I'm not a wine drinker.
Before today's excursion, in fact, I could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine: red, white and Carlo Rossi.  The reds are good with meat.  The whites go with fish.  And, according to what I learned from my dad, Carlo Rossi goes with a glass of ice.
So, exploring South Africa's wine country, just a short drive from Cape Town, seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day.  I mean, it was that or go to a museum.
Our guide, Jack, was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject, but without being a pretentious jerk.  Really, as far as he is concerned, the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy.  I didn't ask, but was curious if that applied to Boone's Farm?
Throughout the day, we hit four wineries, tasting 23 bottles in all.  I know because I kept hash marks on my hand.  I'm pretty classy.
Now, despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat, I can't say that I'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than I was this morning when I woke up.  However, I did manage to get a solid buzz.  And that should be worth something.
Even without the wine, a visit to South Africa's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler's to-do list. It's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful. If you need an added incentive, there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11.
I personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution. He didn't seem to care. He also didn't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese. But I thanked him anyway.
What can I say? I'm not a wine drinker.
