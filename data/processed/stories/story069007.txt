Delicious cupcakes can make pretty much any situation sweet.
So when NBA star LeBron James wanted to apologize to his neighbors in Cleveland for a recent bout of chaos he headed straight for the bakery.
His decision to re-sign for his hometown Cavaliers franchise prompted an explosion of joy in the city, and an explosion of interest in him.
News crews descended on his property in the Bath Township area of the city as well as fans after he announced he was coming home.
And his way of saying sorry to his community was to enlist a local bakery to deliver the treats on behalf of the LeBron James Family Foundation.
Contained within the boxes were six "Just A Kid From Akron Cherry Cola" cupcakes and six "Homecourt Chocolate Chunk" cupcakes.
Attached to the cupcakes was a note that read: "Dear friends, we know things have been hectic in our neighborhood these past few weeks and we are sorry for the chaos.
"We are so thankful to live in this wonderful community and we are so blessed to have understanding neighbors like you."
James is one of the NBA's biggest stars and left the Cavs in storm of controversy in 2010 when he announced he was signing for the Miami Heat in a televised special called "The Decision."
A minority of Cavs fans still haven't forgiven James for walking out on his local team but he went on to win back-to-back NBA Championships with the Heat.
His announcement on July 11 prompted a wave of euphoria in Cleveland, with "Welcome Home" banners plastered all over the city.
