(CNN)Wanted: film director, must be eager to shoot footage of golden lassos and invisible jets.
CNN confirms that Michelle MacLaren is leaving the upcoming "Wonder Woman" movie (The Hollywood Reporter first broke the story).
MacLaren was announced as director of the movie in November.
CNN obtained a statement from Warner Bros. Pictures that says, "Given creative differences, Warner Bros. and Michelle MacLaren have decided not to move forward with plans to develop and direct 'Wonder Woman' together." (CNN and Warner Bros. Pictures are both owned by Time Warner.)
The movie, starring Gal Gadot in the title role of the Amazon princess, is still set for release on June 23, 2017. It's the first theatrical movie centering around the most popular female superhero.
Gadot will appear beforehand in "Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice," due out March 25, 2016.
In the meantime, Warner will need to find someone new for the director's chair.
