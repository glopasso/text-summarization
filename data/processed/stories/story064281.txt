The San Antonio Spurs are one win away from winning the 2013 NBA championship after a 114-104 victory over the Miami Heat in Game Five of the Finals.
Spurs star guard Tony Parker showed no signs of the hamstring injury which hampered him during Game Four, scoring 26 points to delight the AT & T Center crowd.
"It was a physical game. Great game. I was just trying to pace myself better, if I can say that, during the game," the Frenchman told reporters.
"Or else I'd be out of gas like I did in Game Four, where in the second half I didn't have enough juice and my hamstring was kind of fatigued. In this game I was trying to take my time and it helped."
Argentine Manu Ginobili turned in his finest performance of the series so far, adding 24 points and 10 assists.
The Spurs opened up a 20-point lead in the third quarter, with the crowd showing their appreciation with chants of "Ma-nu" as Gregg Popovich's team closed on a first NBA title since 2007.
"I was having a tough time scoring, and I needed to feel like the game was coming to me, and I was being able to attack the rim, get to the free-throw line, and make a couple of shots," said Ginobli.
"So it felt great when I heard that. To feel that I really helped the team to get that 20-point lead, it was a much-needed moment in the series. So I'm glad to see it happen."
For the Heat, LeBron James and Dwayne Wade both scored 25 points as Miami continued a run which has seen the 2012 champions alternate between wins and losses over its last 12 playoff games.
Tuesday's Game Six will see the series return to Miami's American Airlines Arena, which will also stage Game Seven if it is required.
