Two men died Saturday morning when their pickup collided head-on with one of Trace Adkins' tour buses north of Shreveport, Louisiana.
Adkins was not on the bus, but five members of his band and crew suffered minor injuries, the country music singer's Web site said.
The bus was en route to Bossier City for a show at the CenturyTel Center. Adkins had already arrived at the venue when he heard the news, according to his Web site.
"This is a real tragedy," Adkins said in a statement. "Two people have been killed and I don't even know their names. So out of respect for their families, I prefer not to comment too much at this time."
Adkins said he would perform a scaled-down acoustic set at Saturday's show, which also featured singer Martina McBride. He will sit out a show in Pensacola, Florida, on Sunday.
Adkins began his music career more than a decade ago with a platinum-selling debut, and has released nine albums since then.
In 2008, he appeared on NBC's "The Celebrity Apprentice," and last year, ventured into the world of comic books with the launch of the four-part "Luke McBain," based on his likeness and persona.
He is also the author of a book, "A Personal Stand: Observations and Opinions from a Freethinking Roughneck."
