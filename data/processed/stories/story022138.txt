Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has arrived in his home country from Cuba, where he underwent cancer treatment, the Venezuelan state-run broadcaster VTV reported Saturday.
He returned after roughly a week in Cuba, where he received chemotherapy treatment.
Chavez underwent surgery to remove a cancerous tumor last month. He has not said what type of cancer he has.
VTV published an image of the president arriving Saturday night.
