A judge ordered two men to stand trial on charges relating to the beating of San Francisco Giants fan Bryan Stow after a Los Angeles Dodgers game last year.
Marvin Norwood, 30, and Louie Sanchez, 29, both of Rialto, California, are each charged with mayhem, assault and battery, and all three charges are felonies, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office.
The Los Angeles judge made the ruling in the defendants' preliminary hearing, which began last week. The two men have pleaded not guilty.
Stow, a 42-year-old paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the March 31, 2011, beating in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium after a game with the Giants.
Stow is recovering from a brain injury suffered in the beating, and a website set up by his family stated last week, "As we have said before, Bryan's memory was hugely affected, mainly his short term. It's really hard to see him forget even something that happened minutes ago.
"Bryan still doesn't understand or realize what has happened. When he expresses frustration or seems sad or confused we just remind him of how far he has come and how strong he is," the website said.
Sanchez is also charged with two misdemeanor counts -- one for battery and the other for assault -- against one person inside the ballpark and another person in the parking lot on the same day, according to court documents provided by prosecutors.
Sanchez and Norwood were arrested at their San Bernardino County homes July 21.
The defendants' next court date is June 22.
