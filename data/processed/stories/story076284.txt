No country has a higher life expectancy than Monaco -- and it's not even close.
The average life expectancy in the tiny European principality is 89.73 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. That's a full five years more than Macau, which was second on the list at 84.41.
It's also 10 years more than the United States, which comes in at No. 49 with an average life expectancy of 78.37. The world average is 67.07.
Twenty-nine nations have life expectancies over 80, but there are also eight under 50. It might not be surprising that Afghanistan (45.02) is part of that eight. The rest are African countries, including last-place Angola (38.76), which is still rebuilding from a 27-year civil war that ended in 2002.
Angola also has the highest crude death rate in the world, with 23.4 deaths a year for every 1,000 people, the CIA World Factbook says.
