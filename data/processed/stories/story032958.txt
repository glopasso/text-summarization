One hundred and eighty days apparently wasn't enough time for the buyer of a winning $77 million lottery ticket to come forward.

The Powerball ticket from a June 29 drawing was not turned in by Monday's deadline, said J.B. Landroche, spokesman for the Georgia Lottery.
Winning numbers from the drawing were: 24-30-45-57-59. The Powerball was 26, according to the lottery.
Not that it matters now.
The winning ticket was purchased at the Pilot Travel Center in Tallapoosa, Georgia, near the Alabama line.

Unclaimed Powerball jackpot prize funds are returned proportionately to each participating state based on that state's sales for the particular drawing, officials said. Forty-two states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands participate in Powerball.
In Georgia, unclaimed prize funds go back into the prize pool to be used for future game prizes, special prize promotions and ultimately are paid out to players. The lottery in Georgia benefits education.
