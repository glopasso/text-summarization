Volunteers flocked to a southern California community to help residents mop up last week's flood damage ahead of what meteorologists are predicting will be more rain.
Five homes were destroyed and nearly 75 damaged in the San Bernardino County community of Highland when water and mud rushed through the foothill town last week, authorities said.
Total damage, including the cost of cleanup and lost property value, could hit $17.2 million, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.
"We feel very fortunate to have all these volunteers just help out, without even getting paid. They're just trying to do something good for the community," Cesar Garcia told CNN affiliate KABC.
Garcia spoke inside his home, still steeped in mud. Outside, unstable hillsides were covered in plastic while as many as 600 volunteers worked to clear the debris.
They laid sandbags in a bid to divert future water flows in preparation for more rainfall, which is expected soon.
The National Weather Service has forecast a storm moving into the area late Tuesday night into Wednesday.
CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said the storm should be much smaller than the one last week, but that it could dump as much as two inches of rain or two feet of snow in the mountains of California. Because the ground is already wet, the storm could cause problems, he said.
Last week, monsoon-like conditions overwhelmed southern California, creating flash floods that kept workers at home and businesses and streets knee deep in mud and water.
