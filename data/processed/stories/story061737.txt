Hawaii's Governor Neil Abercrombie said the tsunami has caused tens of millions of dollars in damage and he plans to visit some of the damaged areas Tuesday.
The tsunami that devastated Japan brought powerful waves to the Hawaii islands last week.
Abercrombie has signed a "state of disaster proclamation" because of the damage. The proclamation will allow the state to get federal funds.
