Look! Out by the bridge! It's ... it's ...
Ant-Man?
Yes, Ant-Man, also known as Scott Lang, a superhero who can change his size, thanks to the scientific prowess of Dr. Hank Pym.
Paul Rudd is playing Lang, who has a two-bit criminal background, in the movie -- due out next year -- and Marvel just released a photograph of the grizzled figure standing by San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge, an old Ford van nearby.
"Ant-Man" is being directed by Peyton Reed ("Bring It On," "Yes Man") with a script from Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish and Adam McKay. Michael Douglas is playing Pym.
Judy Greer, John Slattery join 'Ant-Man'
The movie will also film in Atlanta.
