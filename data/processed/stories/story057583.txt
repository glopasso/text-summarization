Kim Kardashian's and Kris Humphries officially became divorced this week -- 20 months after she filed papers to end their 72-day marriage.
Los Angeles County Superior Court confirmed to CNN on Tuesday that the divorce became final Monday.
This simplifies life for Kardashian, 32, as she is close to giving birth to a daughter, fathered by new boyfriend Kanye West.
The due date has not be made public, although she did reveal the baby's gender this week on her reality show "Keeping Up with the Kardashians."
Humphries, an NBA forward, accused Kardashian of fraud by entering the marriage only to make millions of dollars with their wedding, Humphries' lawyer, Marshall Waller, told Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Stephen Moloney last year.
The August 20, 2011, wedding was aired in October on E! Entertainment in a two-part special titled "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event."
