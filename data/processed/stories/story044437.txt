(CNN)The world's highest-profile polygamist now has a new wife ... sort of.
Kody Brown and his four wives -- Meri, Christine, Janelle and Robyn -- star in the TLC series "Sister Wives," a reality show about life with their family, which includes their 17 children. Brown legally wed his first wife, Meri, in 1990 and has reportedly divorced her in order to legally marry his fourth wife, Robyn.
Legally, Brown can be married to only one woman.
The fundamentalist Mormon family released a statement to "Entertainment Tonight" saying they have "chosen to legally restructure" their family.
"We made this decision together as a family. We are grateful to our family, friends and fans for all their love and support."
The show premiered in 2010 and has documented the family's highs and lows, including tensions among the wives and with Brown.
Brown married Robyn in a spiritual ceremony during the first season.
Brown has a teen daughter with Meri, six children each with Christine and Janelle and a son with Robyn. Robyn also has three children from a previous relationship.
