Michelin North America, Inc., announced Thursday it is voluntarily recalling about 841,000 of its BFGoodrich and Uniroyal tires because tread-belt separation may cause them to lose tread and/or deflate quickly.
Though no deaths or injuries have been reported related to the recalled tires, "a small number of the tires" have experienced tread loss, the company said in a news release.
"This condition may increase the risk of a vehicle crash," said Mike Wischhusen, Michelin's technical director, in a letter to tire owners.
The tires typically are mounted on commercial light trucks and full-size, heavy-duty vans, though some people may have bought them as replacement tires for their personal vehicles.
"It is important that all recalled tires be removed from service as soon as possible," Wischhusen said in the letter, which urges consumers to visit their BFGoodrich retailer to have them replaced without charge.
About 799,900 of the tires were sold in the United States; the others were sold in Canada and Mexico, the company said.
Customers returned 0.017% of the tires -- representing about 143 tires in all -- for tread and/or air loss, the company said.
The recalled tires are BFGoodrich commercial tires LT 235/85 R16 120 Q LRE and LT 245/75 R16 120 Q LRE, and Uniroyal Laredo tires LT 235/85 R16 120 Q LRE and LT 245/75 R16 120 Q LRE.
The tires were produced between April 2010 and the end of July 2012.

"We deeply apologize for the inconvenience to customers and dealers," said Wischhusen. "It's our responsibility to put safety first in this matter -- as we do in every aspect of our business -- and voluntarily recalling these tires is the right thing to do."
