The Ethiopian born designer has an eye for style. She launched a line of high-end handbags in 2006 and a year later married celebrated chef Wolfgang Puck. Together the couple live in LA and have made Forbes magazine's list of "Married celebrity entrepreneurs". While loving the California lifestyle, she still has strong connections to Ethiopia, putting much of her energy into her charity work there.
