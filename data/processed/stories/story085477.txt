A week after Adam Lanza opened fire on Sandy Hook Elementary school, murdering 20 children, six school employees and his own mother before taking his life, the nation is left asking, "Why?"
On response is to explore Lanza's mental health. While CNN has not confirmed that Lanza was mentally ill, mental illness has been a common thread in many of the mass shootings in the last 60 years.
