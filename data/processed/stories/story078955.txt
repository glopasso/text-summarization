Canadian officials say they have arrested a man convicted in 2002 of child molestation in Arizona.
Steven Dyer was arrested Tuesday night at a Montreal airport as he returned to Canada from a trip, Canadian authorities said.
Dyer was convicted in Arizona in 2002 of 12 counts of sexual conduct with a minor and one count of public sexual indecency with a minor present, according to authorities.
He had been released on bail in late 2001 and failed to show up for court proceedings. He was convicted in absentia and faces a minimum prison sentence of 169 years in Arizona.
Canada Border Services officials say they had information that Dyer had been living in Vancouver under an assumed name, and they were following up on a tip when he was arrested in Montreal.
Dyer was in custody in Montreal Wednesday, and Canadian authorities say he will now face charges in Canada.
Dyer was featured on the program "America's Most Wanted." According to the program's website entry on Dyer, the charges against him in Arizona involved incidents with two youths.
