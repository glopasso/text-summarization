Soap opera actor Dylan Michael Patton faces a judge Thursday on charges he sold cocaine out of his Los Angeles home.
Patton, 20, played Will Horton for a year on NBC's "Days of Our Lives, according to his Internet Movie Database biography.
Since Patton's Agora Hills home is next to Sumac Elementary School, he is charged with selling drugs within 1,000 feet of an elementary school, the criminal complaint said.
Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested Patton at his home, which they then searched, according to the Los Angeles district attorney's office. "Deputies allegedly seized cocaine from the residence," the release said.
Prosecutors said they will ask Patton's bail be set at $30,000. He would face up to nine years in prison if convicted.
Patton was nominated for a Daytime Emmy for outstanding young actor in a drama series in 2010, according to his official biography.
His role on the daytime soap lasted from February 2009 until January 2010, according to IMBD.com.
A native of Texas, Patton began his professional acting career at age 7 with regional and national commercials, his official biography said. His resume includes a handful of small films and several TV roles, including on "Cold Case" and "That's So Raven."
