The U.S. Open women's singles final between Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka has been postponed until Sunday because of forecast bad weather at Flushing Meadows late on Saturday.
"The weather forecast for this evening is calling for storms with heavy rain and high winds," said a statement on the official U.S. Open website.
"Due to the severe weather forecast, session 25 featuring the Women's Singles Final will be postponed until Sunday, September 9, 2012."
Officials later confirmed that the match will get underway at 4.30 p.m. ET.
Organizers were already running behind schedule on Saturday before the announcement was made.
The first men's semifinal between Tomas Berdych and Andy Murray got underway 90 minutes late due to storms and a tornado warning.
"We are continuing the day session as scheduled and will closely monitor the weather for the remainder of today's day session," the U.S. Open website statement added.
