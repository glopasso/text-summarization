(EW.com) -- Look here, it's Jep, Si and Willie Robertson at New York Fashion Week!
Which begs the question: Why were the Duck Dynasty stars mingling with models backstage at the Evening by Sherri Hill fashion show?
Members of the Robertson clan were in town to watch Willie's 16-year-old daughter Sadie make her runway debut at designer Sherri Hill's Spring 2014 presentation on Monday. Willie, wife Korie, and their three other children â€” John Luke, Will, and Bella â€” sat in the front row alongside Si, Willie's brother Jep and his wife Jessica to watch Sadie strut down the catwalk.

Before the show, the aspiring model admitted to E! News that she was "a little nervous, but more excited than anything."
"I've done small [fashion-related] things in Louisiana, but this is New York Fashion Week," she said. "This is a whole new ball game!"
Robertson modeled a black-and-white gown with a sequin and mesh bodice and polka dot-print skirt, which had been pre-approved by her father. "They have to make it once by me to make sure I give 'em the thumbs-up," Willie said of playing the fashion police.

This isn't the first time designer Sherri Hill has hired celebrity offspring to drum up buzz for her line. In 2012, Kim Kardashian caused a media pile-up when she attended Hill's Spring show to watch stepsister Kendall Jenner hit the catwalk. Kathie Lee Gifford showed up to support daughter Cassidy Gifford at Hill's 2011 show.
Sadie's great-uncle Si told E! that the event was his first fashion show. "And it'll probably be the last," he quipped.
