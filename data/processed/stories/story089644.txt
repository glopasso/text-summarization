A tsunami advisory was cancelled in Japan Wednesday, hours after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the main island of Honshu, the country's meteorological agency said.
The quake was centered 169 kilometers (105 miles) off the east coast of Honshu, directly east of the city of Sendai, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
The quake occurred about 8.8 miles below the earth's surface, the geological survey said.
CNN correspondent Kyung Lah said she could feel the earthquake in Tokyo, 267 miles (429 kilometers) southwest of the quake's epicenter. It lasted as long as three minutes, but there was no significant damage, she said.
TV Asahi showed video of boats rocking back and forth, as well as images taken from shaken city cams as the earthquake hit.
