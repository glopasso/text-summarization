Brooklyn Nets coach and former 10-time NBA All-Star Jason Kidd pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor drunk-driving charge stemming from a 2012 arrest, according to authorities.
Kidd's plea can be reduced to a violation of "driving while ability impaired" if he completes his community service, according to the Suffolk County prosecutor's office. He has agreed to speak to Long Island high school students about the dangers of drunk driving.
Kidd was arrested by Southampton Town police on July 15, 2012, after his SUV smashed a utility pole against several trees, according to police records.
At the time of his arrest, Kidd refused a breathalyzer test and a blood test. The DWI charge was based on the arresting officer's assessment that Kidd smelled strongly of alcohol, had slurred speech, and had "bloodshot, watery and glassy eyes," the Suffolk County prosecutor's office said.
Kidd told police that he was on his way home from having a few drinks at a club.
"Jason has taken responsibility for his actions, and fully realizes that he needs to grow from this experience," Brooklyn Nets General Manager Bill King said Tuesday.
"We are confident he will make these strides on a personal level and have a positive effect on others as well."
Kidd's attorney, Eddie Burke Jr. was not immediately available for comment.
The NBA's senior vice president for communications, Tim Frank, responded to a CNN inquiry with, "I have no statement."
