Tina Maze has become the first woman to surpass 2,000 points in a World Cup season after claiming a ninth victory of the season in the women's downhill at Garmisch, Germany on Saturday.
The 29-year-old Slovenian's tally of 2,024 points means she surpasses Austrian legend Hermann Maier's record of 2,000 points set 13 years ago.
"To get over 2000 points in a season is incredible, it's an amazing thing to do. I'm very proud, but it probably won't sink in until the season is over," Maze said.
Maze, who secured the overall World Cup title in Meribel last weekend, recorded a winning time of one minute 40.46 seconds down the three-kilometer Kandahar course.

America's Laurenne Ross was second with Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch finishing third.
"This season, I had skied well in the downhill, but never managed to cross the finish line with a faultless performance. I had a bit of luck in St Moritz, when I won my first downhill (in February 2008), but there was no luck involved today, it's incredible and I'm very happy," Maze said.
Meanwhile in the men's downhill on Saturday, France's Adrien Theaux claimed the second World Cup win of his career in Kvitfjell, Norway.
The 28-year-old recorded a time of one minute 29.1seconds to pip home favorite Aksel Lund Svindal by 0.19 seconds with Klaus Kroell of Austria coming in third.
"This win comes a bit late. I didn't manage to get on to the podium at the world championships, but it is always nice to win a World Cup race. I am satisfied," Theaux said.
