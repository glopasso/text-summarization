Former Inter Milan striker Adriano has revealed he had to leave the Italian Serie A giants because of alcohol problems.
Brazili striker Adriano is now enjoying his football again after returning home to play for Flamengo.
The Brazilian ended his contract with Inter by mutual consent in April after a torrid eight years at the San Siro.
Adriano returned to his homeland and signed for Flamengo and the 27-year-old claims he now feels like a new person.
"After the death of my father I fell into a depression that I only managed to cure with alcohol," Adriano told Brazilian magazine R7.
"I was happy only when I was drinking and I never stopped. I went out every night and drank whatever happened to be in front of me: wine, whisky, beer...a lot of beer.
"People think that it was madness to give up the millionaire's contract that I had but the truth is that there is not money enough to compensate for family. I gave up so many millions but I bought happiness."
Adriano had a troubled time in Italy and his career was often called into question by off-the-field reports.
In September 2007, he was sent home to Brazil by Inter as he was unhappy, and he went on to join Sao Paulo on loan for six months before heading back to Italy.
Reports at the time suggested Adriano was once again turning up to training drunk and the Brazil international has admitted that was why the Nerazzurri eventually gave up on him.
He continued: "I turned up every day drunk. I couldn't sleep for fear of being late but at the end I arrived in unpresentable conditions anyway and so they used to send me to sleep in the infirmary while they told journalists that I had some muscle problems.
"I went back to Inter because of coach Jose Mourinho, but it was not enough. I started again with parties, women and alcohol.
"The club didn't want to accept the situation and gave up insisting on my recovery. I'm upset for Mourinho, who rightly argued with several directors in an attempt to convince them to treat me."
