Spanish champions Barcelona have lined up their first signing of the January transfer window after agreeing a deal to sign Ibrahim Afellay from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven.
The Catalan club's website reported on Monday that personal terms for the 24-year-old will be settled "over the next few weeks."
"The player will be registered in January once the winter transfer market opens. Until the deal is finally settled, Ibrahim Afellay wishes to concentrate on the upcoming important games for PSV," read a statement on the website.
"He is a skilful and fast winger who has been thrilling the PSV crowds for quite a few years now, and has won everything in Holland thanks to his straight-forward attacking approach and his good shooting."
Afellay made his debut for the Eredivisie side at the age of 17, and has made 30 appearances for his national team including a trip to the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, playing three times as a substitute.
Born in Utrecht, he has Moroccan parents but decided to represent the country of his birth in 2007.
He has helped PSV to first place in the Dutch league this season, leading by two points from defending champions Twente, and scored in the 10-0 victory over Feyenoord.
Barcelona, who have a long history of signing Dutch players, trail arch-rivals Real Madrid by one point in the Spanish league after 11 rounds.
