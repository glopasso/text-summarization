From a terrorist attack in Tunisia to an election update from Israel to an upcoming eclipse over the Faroe Islands, today's show is taking you around the world. We're also featuring a Character Study on a 13-year-old who started working to fight hunger at age 4. And we're looking into the NCAA "March Madness" tournament and its effects on some athletes' class time.
