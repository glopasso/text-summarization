Syrian President Bashar al-Assad indicated Monday he might consider a halt in fighting in the city of Aleppo to allow U.N. humanitarian aid into the beleaguered city, according to Syrian state-run SANA news agency.
Aleppo is Syria's largest city, and rebels fighting the al-Assad regime still have a strong hold in parts of the city. Isis is also a threat in areas outside of Aleppo.
Al-Assad met Monday in Damascus with U.N. envoy Staffan de Mistura to discuss a U.N. proposal for a fighting "freeze," which was first presented to the U.N. Security Council last month.  A U.N. statement called the meeting a "constructive" discussion.
The plan "merits consideration," al-Assad said after the meeting, according to the Syrian state-run news agency SANA.
Aleppo would only be the first local "freeze" in Syria under the U.N. plan.
"The proposed 'freezes' as envisaged by the United Nations are intended first and foremost to lead to a de-escalation of violence, starting from specific areas with a national impact, and allow for return to some normalcy for the civilians caught in the conflict," the U.N Statement said.
