Nothing makes a workout go by faster than the perfect playlist. Studies show listening to music while exercising can boost your spirits, distract you from feelings of fatigue and increase your workout intensity.
"Music is like a legal drug for athletes," exercise and music expert Costas Karageorghis told the American Council on Exercise. "It can reduce the perception of effort significantly and increase endurance by as much as 15%."
Spotify users must like the high; they've created more than 2.8 million "workout" playlists on the music streaming service.
But after a while, even your favorite tunes can be overplayed. Spotify has released the top tracks that got gym goers moving between January 1 and 13. Steal some to keep your time on the treadmill upbeat. Mobile users can access the playlist here.
