Sheriff's investigators Thursday asked prosecutors to charge Justin Bieber with felony vandalism in his alleged egging of a neighbor's home.
"No decision will be made this week," Los Angeles County District Attorney spokesman Ricardo Santiago told CNN.
Detectives presented their findings to a prosecutor who must decide whether Bieber, 19, will be charged with vandalism and if the charge is a misdemeanor or a felony, Santiago said.
The neighbor accused Bieber of tossing eggs over a fence and onto the mansion next door on January 9. Investigators pressed for a more serious felony charge because the attack allegedly caused an estimated $20,000 in damage.
If it were to happen, a misdemeanor charge would be easier for the singer to deal with, since he would not have to personally appear in court. His lawyer could handle the case without his presence. A felony, which carries a more serious penalty, would require Bieber's attendance in court.

A dozen Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies raided Bieber's $6.5 million home in the exclusive Oaks community in Calabasas, California, last month, taking the security video system as evidence.
Thursday's meeting at the Van Nuys courthouse was the second with prosecutors. The recommendation of a felony charge was confirmed by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. David Thompson.
At the first meeting last week, the detectives were asked to conduct more interviews to "tighten up" their case, Thompson said.
Bieber also faces misdemeanor-level criminal charges in Miami Beach, Florida, and Toronto, Canada.
