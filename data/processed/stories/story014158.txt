Teresa Heinz Kerry left a Boston rehabilitation hospital Saturday nearly three weeks after she experienced a seizure at her Nantucket, Massachusetts, home.
The 74-year-old wife of Secretary of State John Kerry walked out of Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital and is expected to fully recover at home "after some limited outpatient treatment," said Glen Johnson, a spokesman for the secretary.
She has returned to routine family activities "and looks forward to the same with her civic works after a period of rest," he said.
"It was amazing, a miracle," Heinz Kerry, 74, said of her care and caregivers, according to the statement. "They are the kindest people, who love what they do and do it superbly well."
Heinz Kerry suffered the seizure on Nantucket on July 7, underwent tests at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and was then moved to Spaulding.
Born in Mozambique, Heinz Kerry worked for the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations in the 1960s when she moved to the United States.
Her first husband, Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, died in a plane crash in 1991.
Heinz Kerry spoke to CNN's Larry King in 2010 about her battle with breast cancer. He asked her whether she was frightened.
"I wasn't scared because I'm very analytical about things like this," she said. "I'm kind of, I guess, a little fatalistic."
