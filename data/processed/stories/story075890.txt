Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Secretary of State John Kerry, became ill Sunday and was taken by ambulance to a Massachusetts hospital.
Heinz Kerry, 74, was in Nantucket, where the family has a home.
Accompanied by her husband, she was taken to Nantucket Cottage Hospital, said Glen Johnson, the secretary's spokesman. Once her condition was stabilized, she was transferred to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
"The family is grateful for the outpouring of support it has received and aware of the interest in her condition, but they ask for privacy at this time," Johnson said in a statement.
Born in Mozambique, Heinz Kerry worked for the Trusteeship Council of the United Nations in the 1960s when she moved to the United States.
Her first husband, Sen. John Heinz of Pennsylvania, died in a plane crash in 1991.

Heinz Kerry spoke to CNN's Larry King in 2010 about her battle with breast cancer.
He asked her if she was scared.
"I wasn't scared because I'm very analytical about things like this," she said. "I'm kind of, I guess, a little fatalistic."
