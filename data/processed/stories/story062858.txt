Nelson Piquet Jr admitted he will have to wait until the dust has settled on the "crashgate" scandal before he can attempt a return to Formula One.
Nelson Piquet Jr has not ruled out a return to Formula One.
The 24-year-old Brazilian attended a Motor Sport Council hearing on Monday over the conspiracy which saw him crash his Renault in the Singapore Grand Prix last year, where he subsequently revealed he is keen on a F1 comeback.
Piquet, who was granted immunity by motorsport's world governing body (FIA) for his testimony, believes his talent was not appreciated by former team boss Flavio Briatore.
Despite the furor surrounding the affair the Brazilian hopes he can return to F1, but added there may be other options too.
"I am aware that because of this (scandal) it will be difficult," Piquet told Germany's Auto Motor und Sport.
"Some people will be afraid that the same thing will happen. But it was a unique case and I have learned from it.
"If I can't find a place in F1, perhaps for one year I will go to America and try to do a good job there until the waves have calmed down a bit.
"I was there in August for a week and spoke with some teams."
