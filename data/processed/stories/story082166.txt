Everyone should know by now that Lorde and Taylor Swift are good friends -- and if you mess with one, you're messing with them both.
DJ/music producer Diplo learned that lesson the hard way on Wednesday, when Lorde stepped in to protect Swift on Twitter after Diplo made a gross observation about Swift's physique.
"Someone should make a kickstarter to get taylor swift a booty," Diplo, who's worked with several of music's biggest names and is rumored to be dating Katy Perry, tweeted to his more than 1 million followers Wednesday afternoon.
It wasn't long before his wish was granted: There's now a "Get Taylor Swift a Booty" fundraising campaign on Fundly.
Obviously, Swift's army of fans wasn't going to take that.
But it was Lorde who delivered the final smackdown.
"should we do something about your tiny penis while we're at it," Lorde messaged Diplo.
If there's an "awesome friend" award, Lorde's winning it hands-down.
The Grammy winner (born Ella Yelich-O'Connor) celebrated her 18th birthday on November 7, and she marked it with some quality time with her BFF Swift.
"It's Ella's 18th birthday technically," Swift shared on Instagram, "but we all know she's really 300 and knows all the secrets of the universe."
