Six people died Saturday when a church van overturned and rolled on Interstate 87 north of New York City, police said.
The incident occurred around 3 p.m. in the town of Woodbury in Orange County, said State Police Sgt. David Malone.
An undetermined number of people were taken to nearby hospitals with injuries, he said.
One of the first on scene, Second Assistant Fire Chief Pat Prozzillo told CNN affiliate YNN that the accident was caused by a blown tire and that "the van rolled approximately three to four times. About six to seven people were ejected," he said.
Good Samaritan Hospital received four female passengers, two of whom were in intensive care, said Deborah Marshall, a spokeswoman for the Suffern medical center.
The four most critically injured were taken via air to Westchester Medical Center, according to Prozzillo.
Malone said details on the accident were hazy.
