A small plane with five people on board crashed in Lincolnshire, Illinois, on Monday night, authorities said.
Two people are believed dead, said Elizabeth Isham Corey of the Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman. The others were hospitalized, she said.
The Piper Navajo plane left Jessup, Georgia, and was five miles away from Chicago Executive Air Park when the pilot reported fuel problems, Corey said.
It crashed in the Riverwood neighborhood in Lincolnshire.
