A woman in Montana is accused of pushing her husband off a cliff after an argument. The pair had been married for just more than a week.
Jordan Linn Graham made an initial appearance in court Monday to face a charge of second-degree murder. If convicted, she faces life in prison.
According to a criminal complaint, Graham recently told a friend she was having second thoughts about marrying Cody L. Johnson. CNN affiliate KECI reported the couple had been married for just more than a week.
The complaint said the couple argued the night of July 7. Upset, they decided to go hiking in Glacier National Park in Flathead County, Montana, where they continued to fight.
Graham told police that her husband grabbed her by the arm. She turned and removed it.
"Graham stated she could have just walked away, but due to her anger, she pushed Johnson with both hands in the back and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff," the complaint read.
His body was discovered several days later.
Graham's attorney, Michael Donahoe, declined to comment on the case.
According to the complaint, Graham reportedly told a friend she planned to talk with Johnson about her reservations on July 7. The same day, Graham sent the friend a text message saying, "Oh well, I'm about to talk to him."
The friend responded, "I'll pray for you guys."
Graham wrote back: "But dead serious if u don't hear from me at all again tonight, something happened."
