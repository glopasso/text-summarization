Officials rescued a 19-year-old New York University student who was stuck between two buildings near his dorm in lower Manhattan Sunday night, New York police said.
The New York Fire Department received the emergency call around 5:07 p.m. and found the man stuck in a space about six to 12 inches wide, according to firefighter Michael Madison. It took about 90 minutes to break through three layers of cinder block and pull the man out from the tight space, he said.
After being rescued, the man was transported to Bellevue Hospital Center and is in serious condition, Madison said.
Authorities do not know how the man became trapped. He was was conscious as officials removed him from the space between the two residential buildings at 80 Lafayette Street, according to police Det. Kellyann Ort.
This type of emergency situation is uncommon, and officials are still investigating how the man managed to get stuck, Madison said.
