Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo has been hospitalized to treat a heart condition, a spokeswoman said Sunday.
"He is in good spirits and thanks everyone for their support and best wishes," a spokeswoman for New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the former governor's son, said. "We will provide updates as appropriate."
Mario Cuomo, 82, was New York's governor for three terms from 1983-1995.
Son Chris Cuomo, the host of CNN's "New Day," thanked supporters in a Twitter post Sunday night.
"Pop is in the hospital, and he is doing well enough," he said. "Thx for all the sweet sentiments. Appreciated."
