Former NBA guard Javaris Crittenton waived his first appearance before a judge Friday as he faces murder charges in the death of an Atlanta mother.
He had arrived in Atlanta the previous night, extradited from California, where he was arrested. Only his attorney appeared before Magistrate Judge Maureen Malone on Friday.
The 23-year-old former basketball player's next court date is September 30, Fulton County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tracy Flanagan said. He will remain in Fulton County Jail in the meantime.
Crittenton is charged with homicide murder, felony murder and intent to commit aggravated murder, Flanagan said.
He was arrested in late August at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, on a fugitive warrant.
Atlanta investigators say Julian Jones, 22, was killed in a drive-by shooting August 19.
The mother of four may not have been the target of the shooting, Atlanta police told CNN affiliate WSB. Police believe Crittenton may have been targeting a man who stole jewelry from him.
Jones was walking with two men when she was shot, the affiliate reported. Police believe one of the men with her was the target, the affiliate reported.
Crittenton, who played for Georgia Tech before going professional, was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2007 and then traded to the Memphis Grizzlies.
He was picked up by the Washington Wizards in December 2008, but he was suspended and later released by the NBA in 2010 after a gun-related incident involving teammate Gilbert Arenas.
