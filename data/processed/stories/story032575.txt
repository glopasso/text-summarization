Gossip Girl is heading south of the border.
Mexican producer Pedro Torres released details this week about his plans for "Gossip Girl Acapulco," a revamped Spanish-language version of the U.S. show, which ended its six-season run on the CW Network late last year.
The popular primetime soap gave viewers a glimpse of the "scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite" through the eyes of its title character, known for posting rumors online.
In the Mexican version, co-produced with Warner Brothers International Television Production, "the drama has become tropical without losing its essence," Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said Thursday, citing Torres.
If cast photos released by the show's producers are any indication, the show's characters have different names, but similar looks to their U.S. counterparts.
The show won't hit the airwaves until later in the year, but the Mexican version of Gossip Girl is making her presence known -- where else? -- on social media.
Its Twitter page, @GGAcapulco , already has more than 4,000 followers.
The show is set to start filming next week.
