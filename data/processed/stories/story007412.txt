Sure, it's a great feeling when you randomly stumble on a fantastic new bar while you're out exploring a city.
But when you're there for only a few days, you sometimes want a guarantee that you're going to be getting a well-made drink in a venue with character and style.
That's where this 2014 list of the world's 50 best bars comes in.
Announced by Drinks International magazine during a recent ceremony in London, the list is based on the votes of more than 330 international industry experts.
The 2014 winners include bars from 27 cities in 14 countries, with 14 new entries.
"Overall, Europe appears to be the international epicenter for good drinking as it led the regions' ranking with 21 of its bars included within the 50 best list," says Drinks International in a release.
For the third year in a row, London's Artesian has been named "world's best bar."
In fact, the UK capital has eight bars on the list, more than any other city. These include Nightjar and The American Bar at The Savoy, which join Artesian in the top 10.
Across the Atlantic, Drinks International says the United States saw the strongest growth, with 16 bars included on the final 2014 list.
Four of the top 10 listed bars are based in New York and Seattle.
Australia, meanwhile, has six bars included -- all based in Melbourne and Sydney.
Four Asia bars made the list -- with venues from Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong. The highest is Tokyo bar High Five, voted the ninth best bar in the world.
Finally, Latin America saw three make the list, with two Mexican bars -- Mexico City's La Capilla and newcomer Licoreria Limantour -- joining Floreira Atlantico in Buenos Aires.
