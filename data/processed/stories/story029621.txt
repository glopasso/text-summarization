With Halloween right around the corner, it's about time someone checked to see whether "The Bachelor" is cursed.
The ABC dating competition show doesn't have the best track record when it comes to lasting love connections, and the show's latest match, Juan Pablo Galavis and Nikki Ferrell, have reportedly called it quits.
This isn't entirely surprising, considering the couple has fought off rumors that they were ill-fated from the start.
During his season on "The Bachelor," which aired this year, Galavis was reviled by fans for his apparent lack of sensitivity toward the women competing to be his love interest.
By the time he got down to his final two options, Galavis wasn't interested in proposing to either contestant, although he did want to pursue a relationship with Ferrell. One of the big sticking points for fans was Galavis' refusal to say whether he was in love with Ferrell.

The months that followed "The Bachelor's" finale in the spring were filled with rumors of a breakup, and those rumors only became louder when Ferrell and Galavis signed up for season 5 of VH1's "Couple's Therapy."
Apparently that therapy didn't stick. Over the weekend, Ferrell is said to have unfollowed Galavis on Twitter and Instagram, while posting a message on her own Instagram feed that many think was aimed at Galavis:
"Isn't it pathetic how we waste so much time on certain people and in the end they prove that they weren't even worth a second of it," the message says.
According to People magazine, Ferrell's romance with Galavis is definitely done.
"It can't be saved, and they're not even speaking anymore," a source told the magazine. The source added that Galavis was "getting tired of her childish antics and temper tantrums," but it was Ferrell who "decided that she didn't want to keep up the facade anymore."
