The death toll from this weekend's building collapse in southern India has risen to 32, but two workers were pulled out alive two days after the accident, a police official said Tuesday.
The 11-story building under construction in Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, toppled over during heavy rains Saturday. Emergency crews furiously dug through the rubble for 20 people thought to be missing, police said.
The pair of workers were rescued early Tuesday from under the debris of the caved-in structure, according to city Police Commissioner Sebastian George, and they were rushed to a hospital. They are among 27 survivors now under medical care, George said.
Also Saturday, at least 10 people were killed when a rundown four-story building in New Delhi collapsed.
Building collapses in India are an all-too-common occurrence and have killed hundreds of people over the past several years.
