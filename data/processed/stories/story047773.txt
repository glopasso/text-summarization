Weather officials refer to Sandy as "remnants," and by Thursday, these had stopped producing significant warnings. But as Sandy finally dies out, the tragedy has only begun for some.
Under calmer, sunlit skies from Maryland to Rhode Island, politicians, rescuers and journalists in elevated vehicles, boats and copters surveyed the silent wreckage of houses and lives turned to ruin or wiped out completely by a tempest for the record books.
While the leftovers of the superstorm flung its last gales across the Great Lakes on Wednesday, dumped rain on the nation's far northeast corner and sprinkled its last snowflakes below the Mason Dixon Line, Americans picked up the pieces, reconnected power lines and relied on help from authorities, neighbors and their faith.
Dozens of families likely made funeral arrangements, as Sandy claimed at least 56 lives in the United States; 124 total died in all countries in its path.
A running CNN tally reflects a steady restoration of power, but 4.8 million customers remained without electricity Wednesday night in 15 states and the District of Columbia.
Here's a look at how Sandy has affected the United States:
