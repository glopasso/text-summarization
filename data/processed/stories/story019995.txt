A new Lebanese government was announced Saturday by Suhail Bawji, secretary general of Lebanon's Council of Ministers.
He announced the formation of the new Cabinet and named the new ministers in a televised news conference.
The new government brings months of political infighting to an end following Prime Minister Najib Mikati's resignation in March 2013.
Tammam Salam was named in a presidential decree as the head of the new government, the state news agency NNA reported.
Another presidential decree accepted Salam's suggested Cabinet and named the new ministers, while a third formally accepted Mikati's resignation.
There have been increased tensions in Lebanon in recent months, where sectarian divisions reflect those in neighboring war-torn Syria, and a number of explosions have rocked the capital.
Mikati urged the Lebanese people last month to overcome their differences and engage in dialogue or see the situation worsen.
