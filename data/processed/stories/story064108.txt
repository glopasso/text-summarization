A Kansas company is recalling about 50,000 pounds of ground beef products over fears of E. coli contamination.
The National Beef Packing Co. products, which were shipped nationwide, may be contaminated with E. coli O157:H7, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Wednesday.
There have been no reported cases of illness.
In an online statement Wednesday, National Beef Packing Co. reported "a voluntary recall for NatureSource Natural Beef, Naturewell Natural Beef and National Beef commodity ground beef." It said the meat was produced on July 18 and has a use by/freeze by date of August 7.
"We are working closely with authorities to investigate this matter and are contacting our customers who have purchased this product," the company said.
The meat was "shipped in 40 to 60 pound cases to retailers, wholesalers and food service distributors nationwide," the USDA said in a news release.

It's unclear whether it was sold at a retail level.
The product carries the USDA mark of inspection, bearing the establishment number "EST. 208A." The possibility of contamination was raised in a routine Food Safety and Inspection Service inspection.
The recall is the second incident this summer for the company, which recalled 22,000 pounds of beef in June over concerns about E. coli contamination.
E. coli O157:H7 is a potentially deadly bacterium found in recent years in various food products, including raw beef and prepackaged greens, such as spinach and salad mixes. The USDA warns that it causes "bloody diarrhea, dehydration and in the most severe cases, kidney failure."
Approximately 76,000 people are infected with E. coli every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
