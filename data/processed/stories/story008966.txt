(Ars Technica) -- The white plastic MacBook is officially dead for good after Apple notified resellers that it will no longer be available to educational institutions.
The 13-inch machine was essentially killed off for most of the public last July, but the budget laptop continued to be available to schools for the last six months. Now, however, the machine has officially been EOL'd (End of Lifed), bringing the old iBook legacy to an end once and for all.
As noted by MacRumors, Apple informed resellers of the product EOL on Wednesday, saying they had ended the educational distribution channel for the machine. It's unlikely that Apple has been actively manufacturing white MacBooks up to this point, either -- it's not public how long the company did manufacture it (if at all) past last July, but its cancellation this week was likely due to the end of whatever remaining supply was available.
When Apple made the white MacBook unavailable to the public last year, it was on the same day the company introduced its 11-inch MacBook Air for $999 -- the same price the as the MacBook. Apple doesn't typically like to sell Macs for much cheaper than that for extended periods of time, so it was only a matter of time before the white MacBook bid the world farewell.
