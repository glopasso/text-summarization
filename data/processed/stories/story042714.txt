NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (Reuters) -- Mauritanian police found 1,896 lbs (860 kilograms) of cocaine hidden beneath sacks of rice in a parked minibus in the West African country's biggest drug bust, police said late on Monday.
The region has become a major hub for Colombian cocaine being trafficked to highly lucrative markets in Europe, where illegal use of the white powder is a growing problem and street prices are significantly higher than in the United States.
Mauritanian authorities made the find while investigating who was behind the smuggling of a previous batch of more than 600 kilograms of cocaine seized after a small plane made an emergency landing at the northern port of Noudhibou in May.
"During our investigations we noticed a parked minibus which looked different from other such vehicles even though it had registration plates from this country," Police Commissioner Ely Ould Sneiba, director of the country's anti-drugs office, said.
"The investigating judge ordered the police to search the minibus and inside they found 21, 50-kg sacks full of cocaine hidden beneath sacks of rice," he said.
The drugs were packed in 761 bricks, each weighing by 1.13 kg.
Four people were detained in the operation, including one person from Mauritania and one from Western Sahara, which is claimed by Morocco, itself known as a major source of smuggled hashish.
Law enforcement officials say Guinea-Bissau, which adjoins Mauritania's southern neighbor Senegal, is a major hub in a network of sea, land and air routes spanning the Atlantic and much of Africa which are used by Latin American drugs gangs to ferry their valuable contraband to Europe and the Middle East.
