It's not a common scene for Louisville, Kentucky -- but officials say the flooding there could get worse.
More than 80 people have been evacuated from their homes in the area, said Jody Duncan of the Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Emergency Management Agency.
Early Sunday morning, Duncan said another 1-to-1 1/2 inches of rain was expected to fall within an hour.
"We are preparing for the situation to get worse before it gets better," she said. "If the flooding does get worse, there may be mandatory evacuations."
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Jefferson County -- including the Louisville International Airport -- on Sunday morning. The area could see another 2 inches of rain Sunday, the weather service said.
Duncan said there have been no reported injuries from the flooding.
