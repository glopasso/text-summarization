A 5-year-old South Korean girl was killed when a man who jumped from his 11th floor apartment landed on top of her, police said.
The incident took place Wednesday in Busan, a port city in the southern part of the country.
The girl had left her apartment building with her parents when a 38-year-old tenant made his suicide plunge, said Busan Police officer Kim Gil-san.
The man died on the spot. He apparently was being treated for depression, police said.
The girl was taken to a hospital and died of skull fracture, Kim said.
Her parents were unharmed.
South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among economically advanced countries.
