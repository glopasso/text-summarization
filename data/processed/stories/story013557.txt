So what really goes on at the world's busiest airport?
Since midnight Tuesday, a team of more than 30 journalists from CNN has descended on Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport -- the world's busiest by volume of passengers -- to find out.
CNN is looking at the areas we never see when we travel -- behind-the-scenes luggage screening with the Transportation Security Administration, on the ramp with Southwest Airlines ground crews and more. And we're looking at the stories behind the people who pass through and work in the airport every day.
The resulting project will publish later this year, but you can follow along by searching the hashtag #ATL24 on Twitter or Instagram or by following this Twitter list from @CNNTravel.
Here's a collection of some of the most interesting posts so far. Tweet with #ATL24 or post a comment to let us know what you'd like to learn more about at the world's busiest airport.
