Cristiano Ronaldo has escaped punishment over the car smash earlier this year that saw his Ferrari written off.
Ronaldo's Ferrari was a complete write-off after his accident on the way to training.
The Manchester United star, who is set to move to Real Madrid for a world record fee, demolished the front of his high-performance sports car after he hit a roadside barrier in a tunnel on a freeway in the north-west of England city.
No other vehicle was involved and Ronaldo escaped injury. He spoke to police officers at the scene and was also later interviewed as well as giving a written statement.
A Greater Manchester Police spokesman told Press Association Tuesday. "No further action will be taken against the driver of a Ferrari 599 GTB, which collided with a wall on the A538 Wilmslow Road on Thursday, January 8.
"No-one was injured and no other vehicles were involved in the incident."
It was reported that the Portuguese star had only owned the top-of-the-range sports car for just a few days before the accident.
The impact of the crash saw one of the Ferrari's wheels come off and end up 200 meters away, with skid marks on the road clearly prominent.
The FIFA World Player of the Year walked away from the smash and was given a lift to training that morning by then Manchester United teammate Edwin van der Sar who had been driving along the same stretch of road behind him.
Dutchman Van de Sar also provided a statement to police about the incident.
Real Madrid and Manchester United confirmed last week that they had reached a deal to send Ronaldo to the Bernabeu, but it has still to be officially sealed.
