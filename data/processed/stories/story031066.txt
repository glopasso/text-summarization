Four people were electrocuted when a Carnival float struck power lines in the Brazilian port city of Santos early Tuesday, state broadcaster Agencia Brazil reported.
Three men pushing the float were killed instantly, and a 19-year-old spectator who stepped up to help them was also shocked. She died at an emergency room soon afterward, the network reported.
The fatalities marred the last day of Carnival, the Catholic tradition that draws millions of Brazilians to the streets for a pre-Lent party. It is the equivalent of Mardi Gras in the French-settled regions of North America.
