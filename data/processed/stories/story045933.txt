Actress Lindsay Lohan had a car accident on her way to the set Friday, briefly sending her to a hospital as a precaution, her publicist says.
Lohan, 25, was taken to the UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, California, and was released less than two hours later, Steve Honig said in a statement.
Lohan's lengthy legal history
"She is fine," Honig said, adding that Lohan "is already headed back to the set to resume work."
"Fortunately, no one was seriously injured in the accident," Honig said.
Lohan has a history of mishaps while driving, some of which landed her in court.

In 2005, a paparazzo and Lohan were involved in a car accident that raised questions over whether paparazzi were engaged in aggressive car chases after celebrities. The paparazzo was accused of ramming her car.
In May 2007, Lohan was arrested on a misdemeanor drunken driving charge after she lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills, California.

Two months later that year, a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan was charged with drunken driving, cocaine possession and driving with a suspended license.
In March, a Los Angeles judge removed Lohan from probation from the two 2007 drunken driving convictions, but the actress remains on informal probation for two more years on a misdemeanor shoplifting conviction from last year.
Lohan has been in court at least 19 times since her arrest in May 2007.
The strict rules of formal probation that tripped up the actress and led to four probation violations in the past two years are now gone, but she could face 245 days in jail if she is convicted of another crime before the theft probation ends on May 24, 2014.
In all, Lohan has spent 250 days in rehab, 35 days in home confinement, 67 days on community service, 19 days in court and made six trips to jail.
