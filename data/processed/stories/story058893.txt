Shia LaBeouf has at least one high profile supporter.
During an interview conducted at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and posted on IndieWire, Mel Gibson said he can sympathize with LaBeouf who was recently arrested after on outburst in New York City.
"When I see someone like Shia LaBeouf with the bag on his head and stuff, my heart goes out to the poor guy," Gibson said, referencing an appearance the actor once made on the red carpet with a paper bag covering his face. "It really does because I think he's suffering in some way."
Gibson -- who was at the festival in the Czech Republic to receive a lifetime achievement award -- knows a thing or two about run-ins with the law and being labeled "troubled." He said it's tough because "you are under scrutiny if you achieve any type of notoriety."
"People are in line to sort of point the finger at him and say that he's this, that, or the other," Gibson said. "It's easy to judge. But I'm sure he's going through some kind of personal, kind of very very painful, cathartic thing that he has to exorcise and get out there. And he'll probably play it out and come back."
But Gibson holds out hope for LaBeouf who recently announced he was receiving treatment for alcohol addiction.
"He'll be alright," Gibson said. "I actually like the kid, I've never met him but I think he's good."
