MILAN, Italy -- European Super Cup winners Milan were brought back down to earth at the San Siro on Monday, as Fiorentina held them to a 1-1 draw in Serie A.

Fiorentina striker Adrian Mutu earned the visitors a point with a 56th-minute header after Milan playmaker Kaka had scored from the penalty spot in the 27th minute.
Milan, who beat Genoa 3-0 in their opening league game, join Fiorentina as one of seven teams with four points in the league table.
Mutu scored against the run of play from Mario Alberto Santana's cross.
Earlier, Fiorentina defender Dario Dainelli had conceded a penalty when he tripped Massimo Ambrosini in the area.
Filippo Inzaghi wasted a golden chance to win the match in the 71st minute when Kaka slid the ball across the front of Fiorentina's goal. However, the Italy forward somehow managed to miss the ball and an open net.
Fiorentina could have won it late on but midfielder Zdravko Kuzmanovic hit the post.
"I am always angry when we don't get the maximum points, but in this case we did everything we possibly could," said Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti.
"We tried to win and ran quite a few risks, but so soon after our last game it was understandable we had some difficulties."  E-mail to a friend
