Chris Brown is a free man, for now.
The troubled singer was released from a Los Angeles County jail just after midnight Monday, a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department representative confirmed to CNN.
Brown had been in jail since March. He was ordered to be held after being expelled from a court-ordered rehabilitation facility. He had been ejected from the facility for violating the rules.
In May, Brown admitted to violating his probation for his arrest last year for an alleged assault in Washington. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge James Brandlin sentenced Brown to serve 365 days in jail for the admitted probation violation, and the singer was given credit for serving 234 days because of the rehab and jail time.
The case against Brown in Washington, in which he and his bodyguard Christopher Hollosy were accused of beating a man who tried to take a photo of Brown last October, is still pending. Brown has been charged with misdemeanor assault.
