A plane crash in Sudan has killed 32 people, including four ministers and other top government officials, state media reported Sunday.
Engineer Ghazi al-Sadiq, minister of guidance and endowments, died when the private plane he was on went down in the Sudanese mountains due to dust causing poor visibility, state media said.
Also killed in the crash were three state ministers and three major generals.
The plane, a Ukrainian-made Antonov, according to state radio, crashed near Talodi near the border with the new nation of South Sudan. There were no survivors.
The officials were traveling to the border state of South Kordofan for festivities marking Eid, the celebration of the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
State media said the officials were on their way to "bring Eid to different regions."
