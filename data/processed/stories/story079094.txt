Fernando Alonso insists he can still drive Ferrari to the Formula One world title, despite losing ground on his rivals after a disappointing Belgian Grand Prix.
The Spaniard is 41 points behind the current leader in the drivers' championship standings, McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, after he span out in the latter stages at Spa.
But with six races left in the season, Alonso is convinced he can still force his way into the reckoning -- starting with the Italian Grand Prix at Monza on September 12.
"With this points system and the way races swing one way or another, I am convinced we still have a significant chance," Alonso wrote on his Ferrari blog.
"There are 150 points up for grabs, enough to turn the situation around. We must remain calm and concentrate, to try and make up the difference as soon as possible.
"Clearly, there are now three of us who need to make up for ground lost in Spa. It was not the Belgian Grand Prix we were expecting, that's for sure."
Alonso is now focusing on the Italian Grand Prix as a chance to close the gap on Hamilton, and the other three in front of him -- Red Bull pair Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel, as well as Jenson Button, of McLaren.
But he admits his first trip to the famous Monza track as a Ferrari driver will add extra pressure on him to deliver the goods and that a bad result could deliver a fatal blow to his championship hopes.
"There is no denying that the Monza race will be very important," he added. "At our home circuit we will have to do everything to avoid losing any more points.
"A good result here would be a great boost. If things go badly, it won't be over but it would be a hard knock for team morale.
"Racing at Monza for the first time as a Ferrari driver will definitely be a nice feeling. Our team is made up of 95 per cent Italians and you can feel the passion and the will to do well for this special event.
"I can't wait to be there and look forward to seeing the grandstands packed with fans -- we need their support."
