Two British soldiers and a Spanish soldier were killed in separate incidents in Afghanistan, the British and Spanish Defense Ministries said.
The British soldiers died in roadside bomb explosions Monday, a part of southern Afghanistan that has been the site of fierce fighting between the Taliban and coalition troops, the ministry said in a written statement.
The soldiers were on foot patrol at the time, said Lt. Col. David Wakefield, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, a predominantly British military command that conducts operations in Helmand province.
They were identified as belonging to the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment but were not identified by name.
In the other Monday incident, a Spanish military vehicle struck a mine while on a mission to distribute aid, and the explosion killed one soldier and wounded six others, a Spanish Defense Ministry spokesman told CNN.
Killed was a Colombian national, Jon Felipe Romero Meneses, in his early twenties, serving with Spain's armed forces.
The identities and conditions of the wounded soldiers were not immediately available, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified.
The blast happened in Qala-i-Naw province in Afghanistan, where the Spanish troops were escorting a U.N. World Food Programme convoy to distribute aid.
Spain has more than 800 troops in Afghanistan serving in the NATO-led mission, and the government has recently committed to send several hundred more, partly in response to the Obama administration's request for more troops from allied nations.
Spain has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002, and more than 22 Spanish soldiers have died there, including two in November 2008 when a suicide bomber rammed their convoy, and 17 in a helicopter crash in August 2005.
