They say you can buy everything on the Internet.
The latest, uh, must-have appears to be positive pregnancy test results.
Women across the country are selling -- and buying -- them on Craigslist.
One post from Buffalo, New York, sums up the appeal for potential shoppers:
"Wanna get your boyfriend to finally pop the question?  Play a trick on Mom, Dad or one of your friends? I really don't care what you use it for."
That particular test was going for the reasonable rate of $25 dollars. The tests in Texas seem to be slightly more expensive, at $30 a pop.
CNN responded to several ads across the country asking for comment, but received no response.
Got leftovers? Wanna trade?
Then again, the sellers probably weren't expecting to have to explain the sale of what basically amounts to a urine sample to a reporter.
"Need a positive pregnancy test? Serious inquiries only!" said one Atlanta ad, begging the question, how many false leads could one person possibly be getting for this offer?
Another ad reassures buyers conscious of name brands, "This will NOT be a dollar store test. Will be either Clearblue First Response or EPT."
Most ads found by CNN ended the same way, with sellers assuring potential customers "It isn't my business what you choose to use it for."
Or maybe you just really don't want to know.
