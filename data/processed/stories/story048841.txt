A 7.1-magnitude earthquake rattled the Solomon Islands on Friday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
There were no immediate reports of a tsunami.
The quake comes two days after an 8.0-magnitude earthquake struck the same region, triggering a tsunami that killed five people but didn't threaten the wider region.
Four elderly people and one child died after a roughly 1-meter (3-foot) wave hit the Santa Cruz Islands, an eastern region of the Solomon Islands, said Augustine Bilve, a director at a hospital in Lata, the main town in the area.
