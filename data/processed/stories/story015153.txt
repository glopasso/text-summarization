A building under construction in downtown Boston partially collapsed Thursday morning, sending two people to the hospital, the city's fire department said.
The incident happened about 8 a.m. at a construction site at 45 Stuart St., the Boston Fire Department tweeted.
The collapse occurred on the 12th floor of what's slated to be a 33-story residential high-rise, causing damage from the 11th floor's roof down to the fifth floor.
First responders treated two people with injuries that were not life-threatening and then took them to nearby Tufts Medical Center. The fire department later explained that one of those had "a serious head injury," while the other had a minor injury.
"No others workers reported trapped at this time," the fire department tweeted.
According to a sign posted outside the site, near the city's Chinatown district and around the corner from Boston Common, the building was slated to be completed in the middle of next year.
