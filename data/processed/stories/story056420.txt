Michael Jackson's brothers are working on a reunion tour to perform their old Jackson 5 songs, Jermaine Jackson said Monday.
"Michael would want us to continue on," Jackson said, after he unveiled an exhibit of his brother's wax statues at Madame Tussauds in Hollywood.
Saturday marks the second anniversary of the pop icon's sudden death, which the coroner ruled was from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic.
"The brothers now are ready just to keep the legacy going and the music," Jackson said. "We're meeting today about putting a tour together just to play the music because it's such wonderful music. We need to continue to play this music because it's healing for us."
Jackson did not say which of his brothers were involved in the talks. Recent attempts to reunite the brothers on stage were met with frustration and division, including the effort documented by an A&E Network reality show in 2009.
Monday's unveiling was a reunion of sorts for Michael Jackson. It featured wax figures depicting him as a child performing with the Jackson 5, as the "Smooth Criminal" from around 1987 and the "This Is It" Michael Jackson of his last year.
Jermaine Jackson said his favorite was the last statue because of how it captured his brother's onstage posture.
"Someone was really paying a lot of attention to detail," he said.
The Michael Jackson exhibit is on a world tour, spending this summer in Hollywood before heading to Las Vegas in September.
