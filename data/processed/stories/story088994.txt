(CNN)Marin Cilic has withdrawn from the Australian Open after being unable to shake-off a persistent shoulder injury.
The reigning U.S. Open champion was forced to sit out this week's ATP Tour event in Brisbane and had previously said he hoped to be back in time for the year's first major in Melbourne.
However, a post on the player's Facebook page Saturday confirmed the 26-year-old Croat will not recover in time.
"(The) right shoulder injury, that hampers me for some time now ... is improving day by day, but I still don't feel fit enough to be able to compete at the highest level," the post read.
"I am really sad that I won't be able to participate in Melbourne, especially after winning the last Grand Slam in New York, but I was advised by doctors to be careful as much as possible to avoid even more serious problems."
"I have received lots of support letters from my fans worldwide lately and I am grateful for your support and best wishes."
The Australian Open is the year's first grand-slam and begins on January 19 in Melbourne.
World No 12. and 2008 Australian Open finalist  Jo-Wilfried Tsonga was forced to pull-out earlier this week due to an arm injury.
There are also fitness doubts over 14-time major winner Rafa Nadal who has struggled for fitness and form since undergoing appendix surgery last November.
