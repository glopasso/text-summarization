Britain's Andy Murray claimed his third title of the season with a straight sets thrashing of Donald Young of the United States to win the Thailand Open Sunday.
Top seed Murray made no mistake as he swept aside Young 6-2 6-0 in just 47 minutes to add to his victories in Cincinnati and at Queen's Club in London.
"I just played really well," Murray told the official ATP website.
"Towards the end of the first set he started to play a bit better, but once I got up in the second I hardly made any mistakes."
Murray will now head to the Japan Open in Tokyo where the draw is headed by world number two Rafael Nadal, who beat him in the semifinals of the U.S. Open.
Murray is hoping to overtake Roger Federer for the world number three spot by the end of the season.
"It's a very good start. Roger (Federer) always plays very well on the European indoor courts, so I'm sure I'm going to have to win a lot more matches if I want to finish No. 3. That's the goal and I'll keep working hard to give myself a shot at doing that," he added.
Young could not repeat his success over Murray at Indian Wells but will move into the top 50 for the first time after his run to the final.
In other ATP final action Sunday, Serbia's Janko Tipsarevic captured the first career title as he beat Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 6-4 7-5 in the Malaysian Open.
Tipsarevic, seeded third, had been the only player in the Top 20 without an ATP title and had lost his previous four finals.
