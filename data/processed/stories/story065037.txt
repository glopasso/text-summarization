She really is our Golden Girl.

Betty White fast facts
The year Betty White was born, 1922, Reader's Digest was launched, as were the first public radio broadcasts in France and Britain. White has worked in show business since the 1940s, when she appeared on popular radio programs "Rin-Tin-Tin," and "The Great Gildersleeve."
For her part, White was pretty quiet on this birthday, probably because she was so busy. And it doesn't look like she is slowing down anytime soon. In October 2013, Lifetime picked up her canceled NBC show "Betty White's Off Their Rockers."
For White -- who saw a career resurgence in the 2000s with guest starring roles on TV and a gig hosting "SNL" following a grass-roots campaign -- staying busy is probably the best birthday present ever.
"Retirement is not in my vocabulary," she's been quoted as saying. "They aren't going to get rid of me that way."
