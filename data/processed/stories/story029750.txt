Legendary soul singer Aretha Franklin has canceled two free concerts in New York because of an injury, according to a statement issued by her publicists Wednesday.
"Due to fractured ribs and pain in the abdomen, it was necessary for Ms. Franklin to cancel and reschedule the two concerts," said the statement from spokeswoman Gwendolyn Quinn. Franklin's doctors have advised her to come in for tests immediately, the statement said.
Efforts are being made to reschedule the concerts at the end of August, Quinn said.
"I was very much looking forward to being in Brooklyn and having a foot-long hot dog at Coney Island," Franklin said in the statement. "Hopefully I will get it before the end of August."
Franklin, 68, also noted, "I will really miss that nice slice of cake from Congressman Charlie Rangel's birthday party and singing 'Happy Birthday' to him."
Franklin, dubbed the "Queen of Soul," was scheduled to perform at Rangel's 80th birthday party on August 11, the statement said.
The two scheduled performances in Brooklyn were part of a concert series presented by Marty Markowitz, president of Brooklyn borough, Quinn said. The shows were scheduled for Wingate Field in East Flatbush on August 9, and Asser Levy Park in Brighton Beach on August 12. They were to be Franklin's first concerts in Brooklyn, the statement said.
