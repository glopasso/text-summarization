(EW.com) -- Captain America is being redeployed.
The coda to last year's "Captain America" set up "The Avengers" and, in turn, "The Avengers" is apparently setting up a "Captain America" sequel. Marvel Studios and parent company Disney announced today that Chris Evans' patriotic superhero will go straight into a stand-alone followup scheduled to debut April 4, 2014.
While the original "Captain America" began in the 1940s and saw scrawny Steve Rogers become a chemically enhanced super-soldier who helped save the Allies during World War II, the sequel will, understandably, keep him in his chronological position in the present day. After being frozen for decades, and resuscitated in the strange new world of contemporary New York City, Cap is now planning to take it one day at a time.
Marvel's announcement said the sequel will pick up where "The Avengers" (out May 4) leaves off, "as Steve Rogers continues his affiliation with Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. and struggles to embrace his role in the modern world."
What we can infer from that (apart from the obvious, that "Captain America" survives the ordeal of "The Avengers") is that Samuel L. Jackson sounds like he will be a significant part of the sequel, as opposed to the glorified cameos he has done in other Marvel movies.
No other details about the project were released. "Captain America 2" (or whatever it is eventually called â€” let's pray it's not "Cap2n America," or some such) won't be the first sequel to hit theaters after "The Avengers." That honor goes to "Thor 2," which is aiming for release Nov. 15, 2013, with "Game of Thrones" director Alan Taylor taking over for Kenneth Branagh.
One question, though: After all he's been through, isn't it time Captain America got promoted?
"Major" America?
Guess that doesn't have the same ring.
