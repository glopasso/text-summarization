Authorities in the United Arab Emirates arrested seven people suspected of belonging to a terror cell associated with al Qaeda, the official news agency WAM reported Thursday.
The group is accused of planning to carry out attacks that would "undermine the security of the homeland," the report said.
The cell also allegedly planned to recruit new members, promote the work of al Qaeda and raise funds to help the network extend its activities to other countries in the region, the report said.
State security prosecutors will investigate the case before the suspects are brought to trial, it said.
All seven are of "Arab nationalities," WAM reported.
In December, the same state-run news agency reported the arrest of members of a suspected terrorist cell that was allegedly aiming to carry out attacks in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Those suspects were said to be citizens of both nations.
