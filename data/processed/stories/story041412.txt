Juventus remain without a win after two Italian Serie A games after being held to a 3-3 home draw by Sampdoria.
Two goals from Nicola Pozzi and another from Antonio Cassano helped the visitors to a point, with Claudio Marchisio, Simone Pepe and Fabio Quagliarella all on target for the home side.
The result leaves Luigi del Neri's side still without a win and struggling near the foot of the table following their opening 1-0 defeat by Bari two weeks ago.
Unfancied Verona-based minnows Chievo are the unlikely early Serie A leaders and have a 100 per cent record after two games following their 3-1 win at Genoa.
On Saturday, defending champions Inter Milan secured their first victory of the season with a 2-1 win over Udinese.
However, last season's runners-up Roma were thrashed 5-1 at Cagliari while big-spending Milan slumped to a 2-0 defeat by Cesena with strikers Robinho and Zlatan Ibrahimovic both making their debuts for the Rossoneri.
Meanwhile, in the only English Premier League match on Sunday, Liverpool were held to a dour 0-0 draw at Birmingham City.
