If you've got it, don't flaunt it -- at least not on the Spanish resort island of Mallorca, where citizens are so sick of under dressed tourists that fines could soon be issued for inappropriate attire.
A proposed new law, reportedly close to being enacted, will ban the wearing of swimwear outside bathing areas in the island's capital, Palma.
Officials say they're happy for visitors to let it all hang out on the beach, but when it comes to wandering around town, semi-nudity is a no-no.
"I do not know of any upscale resort town that allows this practice," Alvaro Gijon, deputy mayor of Palma, reportedly told a recent press conference.
The proposed crackdown is part of a wider set of measures aimed at tackling what is seen as anti-social behavior on the island, a popular package destination for north Europeans.
No specific penalties have been detailed in Palma City Council's "Ordenanza Civica" -- also known as the "good citizen plan."
'Devoid of superior clothing'
However, the UK's Daily Mail newspaper expressed concerns that what some media outlets called a "bikini ban" could leave unsuspecting travelers facing fines in excess of $800.
Its readers seemed less concerned, with some commenting that they'd welcome a cover-up.
One of them, Calagran, commented: "I've lived on Mallorca for the past 11 years and it makes my skin crawl when I have to stand behind some fat sweaty individual in the supermarket who thinks it's OK to let it all hang out."
Under a section titled "etiquette," the Ordenanza states that it'll be forbidden for anyone to be "naked or nude" in public places or "devoid of superior clothing."
Unlike an ill-fitting pair of Speedos, there is some room for maneuver, however.
The proposed prohibition doesn't apply to boardwalks or streets adjacent to the beach -- so there's no need to dress up when dashing for an ice cream.
