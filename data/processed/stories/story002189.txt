One of NASCAR's top drivers, Kurt Busch, is being investigated for domestic assault, Delaware police said Friday.
The Dover, Delaware, police department issued a statement indicating its investigators first heard of the allegation at 2 p.m. Wednesday.
"The department is still investigating the victim's claims and will not have any further comment on this matter in order to preserve the integrity of the case," police in the Delaware capital said.
Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said his client expects to be vindicated.
"This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship, and Mr. Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect," he said in a written statement.
Details of the claim haven't been released. NASCAR races were held in Dover on September 27 and 28.
Mike Arning, a spokesman for Busch's Stewart-Haas Racing team, said, "This is an allegation Stewart-Haas Racing takes very seriously, but we're still gathering all of the facts and are not in a position to comment in greater detail."
NASCAR released a statement of its own, saying its officials are "aware of the investigation."
"We recognize the seriousness of this matter and are actively gathering information from all parties, including law enforcement authorities and Stewart-Haas Racing," NASCAR said.
Busch is ranked 14th in the NASCAR's Sprint Cup standing, though he is no longer in contention for this year's championship. He won the driving circuit's top prize in 2004.
He is scheduled to race next in Sunday's Quickens Loans Race for Heroes 500 at Arizona's Phoenix International Raceway.
