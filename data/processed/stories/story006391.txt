Two U.N. peacekeepers have been freed in the Darfur region of Sudan more than four months after they were abducted while on patrol, the United Nations said.
Hasan Al-Mazawdeh and Qasim Al-Sarhan, both Jordanian nationals, were abducted on August 20 in the town of Kabkabiya, about 87 miles west of El Fasher.

The two police officers were patrolling the area as part of the joint African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur, known as UNAMID, at the time.
Despite their 136 days in captivity, the two men are apparently unharmed and in good health, according to a statement from UNAMID. The statement did not give details about what led to their release on Wednesday.

The two Jordanians will be flown to the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, and on to their home country as soon as possible, the statement said.
UNAMID thanked the governments of Sudan and Jordan, as well as the governor of North Darfur, for their help in securing the peacekeepers' release.
