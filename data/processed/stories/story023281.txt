Branden Grace continued his charge towards a fourth European Tour title of the season with a five-under-par 67 at St Andrews to take a five-shot halfway lead in the Dunhill Links Championship.
The South African carded a stunning 12-under 60 at Kingsbarns in his opening round to lead by two, but extended his advantage with more fine play.
A bogey at the fourth was followed by five birdies in the next six holes at the Home of Golf and another at the 18th.
Grace, who also won on South Africa's winter circuit last weekend, will face a tougher test at Carnoustie Saturday before heading back to St Andrews for the final round.
"I think the way I'm playing and hitting the ball I'm looking forward to playing Carnoustie. The putter is going and I'm looking forward to it," he told the official European Tour website.
Sweden's Joel Sjoholm also shot a 67 at St Andrews for a 12-under total to share second place with Dane Thorbjorn Olesen, who carded a fine 69 at Carnoustie.
But they will do well to catch Grace, who was one shot shy of the record lowest 36 hole total on the European Tour, set by compatriot Ernie Els at the 2004 Heineken Classic in Australia.
But Europe's Ryder Cup heroes from last week at Medinah were struggling to keep pace.
German Martin Kaymer, who sank the clinching putt in Chicago, was faring best but down in 56th place on three under -- 14 strokes behind.
Swede Peter Hanson trailed Kaymer by a shot but home hero Paul Lawrie will do well to make the cut, which is made after the third round, having reached the halfway stage on one over and tied for 129th.
British Open Els also trailed on one under with twice winner Padraig Harrington of Ireland on level par.
