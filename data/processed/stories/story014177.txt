Jennifer Lopez is well known for backside, but over the weekend she had a scary experience.
The singer posted on Instagram after she and her friend, "King of Queens" actress Leah Remini, were rear-ended by an alleged drunk driver.
Lopez wrote "Sitting at a light, Riding high right before some drunk fool rear ended us in my new whip!!! Thank god everyone ok!!! #GRATEFUL #THANKYOUGOD #DontdrinkandDrive!!!! #cursedthatfoolout #theBronxcameout #dontmesswithmycocnuts #mamabear #leahstayedcalm #thatwasweird"
TMZ reported the pair were traveling along Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu on Saturday when the accident happened while they were stopped at a light. The gossip site said there were two children in the back seat at the time of the collision. Lopez posted a picture of her 6-year-old twins in the back seat along with Remini's 10-year-old daughter, Sofia.
In the caption, Lopez wrote, "These three cuties make my day!! #Coconuts #Sofia #lunchwthekiddies #bigpimpin' #brooklynindahouse."
According to TMZ one of the women called 911 and police nabbed the unnamed driver of the small pickup truck and charged him with suspicion of driving under the influence and hit and run.
