Singer Adam Levine has married an Angel -- of the Victoria's Secret variety, that is.
According to reports, the Maroon 5 frontman and "The Voice" coach wed model Behati Prinsloo in Mexico on Saturday. The nuptials took place in front of more than 200 guests following a pre-wedding beach party the night before, People magazine reports.
CNN has reached out for comment to Levine's rep.
The couple, who began dating in 2012, officially announced their engagement in July.
"She's the coolest person in the world," Levine, 35, recently said of Prinsloo in GQ magazine.
As the newest "Sexiest Man Alive," Levine was aware of his reputation as a ladies' man with a preference for models.
But he told GQ, "I don't date what the person does ... I date the f*****g person," he said. "I could have been a zitty teenager and walked into a Tower Records, and we would have talked about Pearl Jam, and we would have fallen in love when we were 15. And that's when you know. It's like, oh, my God, game over."
According to People, Levine and Prinsloo exchanged vows in front of celebrity guests that included Robert Downey Jr., model Coco Rocha and Levine's Maroon 5 bandmates James Valentine and Jesse Carmichael.
