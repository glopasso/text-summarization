Jessica Barrymore, the half-sister of actress Drew Barrymore, was found dead early Tuesday morning.
Jessica Barrymore, 47, was found in her vehicle on a street in National City, California, near San Diego, the San Diego County Medical Examiner said in a report.
According to San Diego TV station KGTV, a resident noticed Barrymore at the wheel of a car blocking her driveway around 6 a.m. Tuesday. When the resident went to check on her, Barrymore did not respond. Upon seeing "dozens of white pills scattered around," the TV station reported, the resident called police.
Her death was confirmed by the fire department. She was an employee of a Petco store.
Jessica Barrymore and Drew Barrymore are both daughters of actor John Drew Barrymore but have different mothers.
Drew Barrymore, who was born nine years after Jessica, only met her half-sister "briefly," she said in a statement. She expressed sorrow at her death.
"I wish her and her loved ones as much peace as possible and I'm so incredibly sorry for their loss," she said.
A postmortem examination has not been scheduled.
