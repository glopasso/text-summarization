Police in the Philippines have arrested former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo on corruption charges, the state news agency reported Thursday.
Arroyo is at a hospital in Quezon City, police said. On Thursday, officers went to her room, where she was hooked up to an IV to treat hypertension and dehydration.
Police formally arrested her, but she'll remain in the hospital because her health won't allow her to be moved, said senior criminal investigator Jigs Coronel, CNN affiliate ABC-CBS reported.
Police said they've secured her hospital room.
At the time of her arrest, the ex-president's representative and her lawyer were by her side.
She is facing a charge known in the country as plunder.
Arroyo is accused of fraudulently transferring money from a Philippine charity, CNN confirmed.
Last year, she was charged with electoral sabotage.
