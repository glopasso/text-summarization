The trial of Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius, charged with murder in the death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, will begin in March 2014, his attorney Kenny Oldwage told CNN on Sunday.
The first phase will take place in March, but the entire trial could take place at various times across a year or more due to potential motions and postponements along the way.
Pistorius will be served with an indictment Monday following the completion of the investigation. It's the day that would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday.
Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death.
The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his home. He says he mistook her for a home invader.
The police investigation team "is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer," a police statement said.
The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs.
Pistorius has started sprinting again for the sake of his emotional health, not for training to compete again, the family said.
