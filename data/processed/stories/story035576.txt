Former baseball slugger Jose Canseco, who accidentally shot himself in a finger on his left hand while cleaning a gun, tweeted a photo of the injured hand on Wednesday.
"Hope I can keep my finger but grateful it wasn't something worse," he tweeted.
He said his fiancee, Leila Knight, was taking good care of him, but he got no sleep.
Canseco has returned to his Las Vegas home where the shooting took place. Police say Canseco was wounded while he was cleaning a handgun.
Canseco, who hit more than 450 home runs during his 17 seasons in the big leagues, was hit when his semiautomatic handgun accidentally went off, Las Vegas police said.
Canseco won the American League Rookie of the Year award in 1986 and was the league MVP two years later while with the Oakland A's.
He also played for the Boston Red Sox, Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Tampa Bay Rays and Toronto Blue Jays during his career from 1985 to 2001.
A controversial figure and admitted steroid user, he claimed there was widespread use of performance enhancing drugs in Major League Baseball. He wrote two books on the subject -- "Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big" and "Vindicated: Big Names, Big Liars, and the Battle to Save Baseball."
