After a blazing hot winning streak, the Heat got turned off in Chicago.
The Miami Heat's 27-win run ended Wednesday night with a 101-97 loss to the Chicago Bulls.
LeBron James and company were six wins away from the NBA record of 33 consecutive victories. That record belongs to the 1971-1972 Los Angeles Lakers.
So close: Miami Heat not the only ones to almost break a record
Before Wednesday's defeat in Chicago, the Heat's last loss was on February 1 to the Indiana Pacers.
Despite James' 32 points, Miami couldn't top Luol Deng and the Bulls in their third meeting this season.
While some Bulls fans reveled in triumph, holding a sign proclaiming, "THE STREAK IS OVER!!", many Chicago fans gave the Heat a standing ovation as the team left the court.
The Bulls have been a formidable opponent for Miami in the past. The Heat have a 40-50 all-time record against the Bulls in regular season, and a 15-30 record for games played in Chicago.
