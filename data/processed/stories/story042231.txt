The United States might be in a tricky economic situation, but it won't stop Americans from buying vampire fangs or princess tiaras.
- U.S. consumers spent more than $2.5 billion on costumes this year, according to the National Retailers Federation.
- The average household has shelled out $21.05 in Halloween candy alone.
- When the economy is down, Halloween spending soars, according to Ellen Davis of the National Retail Federation. "People love, in an economy like this one, to just get out, let loose, have a little bit of fun," Davis said.
And if the ghosts and goblins aren't scary enough, the health effects from all that candy might be.
- The average child collects an estimated 3,500 and 7,000 calories on Halloween night, according to Dr. Donna Arnett, chair of the Department of Epidemiology in the University of Alabama at Birmingham's School of Public Health. The estimate was based on nutrition facts of popular Halloween candies.
- A 100-pound child who eats 7,000 calories worth of candy would have to walk for almost 44 hours or play full-court basketball for 14.5 hours to burn those calories, according to Arnett.
But Halloween's not just about costumes and candy, of course. It's also about giant orange fruits with scary faces.
- Marc Evan and Chris Soria are professional artists for most of the year -- until September, when they become the Maniac Pumpkin Carvers. Each Halloween season they spend all their time in a Brooklyn basement carving pumpkins, each with an intricate design, which sell from $150 to $400 a piece.
- The United States produced more than 1 billion pounds of pumpkins last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
