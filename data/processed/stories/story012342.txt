(CNN)U.S. District Judge Terrence Berg is recovering from a gunshot wound after an apparent robbery attempt in Detroit.
The FBI confirms he was shot Thursday night. CNN affiliate WDIV is reporting that the judge was shot in front of his home and that Detroit police say they think it "happened during a robbery attempt, which likely had nothing to do with his profession."
Berg was nominated by President Obama to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in April 2012. Berg also was an assistant U.S. attorney for over 20 years, specializing in fraud and technology crimes, according to his District Court biography.
"Detroit police said two men approached Berg, a struggle ensued and a shot was fired, striking him in the leg. The two men, likely in their teens to early 20s, escaped the scene in a dark-colored Dodge Charger," according to WDIV reports. The affiliate says Berg was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.
Berg was born in Detroit in 1959. He is married and has three children.
