Sir Elton John and David Furnish are now husband and husband.
The two married Sunday in Britain, where same-sex marriage became legal earlier this year.
They had a civil partnership ceremony in 2005, after 12 years together.
They have two children -- Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John and Elijah Joseph Daniel Furnish-John.
The two men invited people all over the world to join them for the ceremony via Elton John's brand new Instagram feed.
