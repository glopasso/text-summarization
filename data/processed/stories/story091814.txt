Ever watched a movie and wished that was your life -- or at least your vacation?
Now it can be, just as long as your fantasies involve Finland.
Over-the-top dreams-to-reality filmmaking is the latest luxury travel offering to come out of the Nordic nation.
Called "The Hollywood Experience," the custom-designed travel concept was created by Janne Honkanen, owner of high-end travel company Luxury Action.
The concept goes like this: the client comes up with a "literary or visual narrative" that serves as a script for his or her "Hollywood movie."
This could be parents who want to travel with their children to Santa's workshop in the North Pole.
Or a "Bourne" fan who wants his own car chase caught on video.
Or a "Chronicles of Narnia" reader who'd love to step into the Hundred-Year Winter.
Personalized epics
The company arranges the on-site production and movie shoot, as well as the final edit incorporating visual or sound effects.
"My returning clients are always looking for something upgraded and more personalized," says Honkanen about how the concept came about.
"These busy business people have dreams and want to offer something unique to their family and children."
Honkanen says was inspired by his previous career in professional racing (snowmobiles in winter, jet skis in summer) and his own experience of turning a whimsical idea into reality -- he opened a chocolate shop after watching the Johnny Depp/Juliette Binoche film "Chocolat."
Despite its name, the package is more about the travel aspect than the film component, which is optional, says Honkanen.
Fulfilling a fantasy doesn't come cheaply though.
The custom design work, planning and script costs â‚¬20,000 ($26,800) per week to put together -- with a minimum one-week requirement.
The cost of the shoot and edit are extra.
Still, at least you can guarantee yourself a happy ending.
