A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck early Sunday off Indonesia, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The quake rattled a remote swath of sea between the Pacific and Indian oceans, north of Australia and east of Timor-Leste, some 5.6 miles (9 kilometers) deep, according to the U.S. agency.
It was centered approximately 212 miles (340 kilometers) west-northwest of Saumlaki in Indonesia's Tanimbar Islands, 217 miles east-northeast of Dili, Timor-Leste, and 226 miles of Ambon, Indonesia.
Neither the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center nor the Japan Meteorological Agency issued tsunami warnings or advisories immediately after the tremor.
