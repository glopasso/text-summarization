Beware learning American history through Groupon promotions. Contrary to what the online coupon company claims, Alexander Hamilton was never a U.S. president.
The discounter put out a news release announcing "Groupon Celebrates Presidents Day by Honoring Alexander Hamilton," and offering $10 off of all local deals above $40.
"The $10 bill, as everyone knows, features President Alexander Hamilton -- undeniably one of our greatest presidents and most widely recognized for establishing the country's financial system," the Business Wire release read.
Hamilton, whose portrait does grace the $10 bill, was the first treasury secretary and is credited with laying the foundation of the U.S. financial system.
But he was never president.
When people suggested Groupon's promotion was tongue-in-cheek, it responded through its Twitter account: "Joke? We'd never joke about saving $10! #AllKindsOfSerious"
@carmstrong07 was not convinced, tweeting: "Gee whiz, it's almost as if @Groupon did something ridiculous to get everyone online talking about them."
"We're shocked by this implication! Shocked!" the company replied.
In case Groupon decides to give a $100 discount next year, Benjamin Franklin -- the face on the C-note -- was never a U.S. president either.
