Jhonattan Vegas has made history at the Bob Hope Classic, winning a three-man play-off on the Palmer course at La Quinta to become the first Venezuelan in history to claim a PGA Tour title.
The 26-year-old Vegas, who was making just his fifth appearance on tour, made a 13-foot par putt on the second play-off hole to defeat Gary Woodland, after defending champion Bill Haas had been eliminated on the first play-off hole.
After missing a nine-foot putt that would have secured victory on the final hole of regulation play, Vegas then improbably became the first rookie to win the 52-year-old tournament with a spectacular up-and-down after knocking his 92nd tee shot into the water 160-yards from the hole.
"Just to think about winning on the PGA Tour, that's one thing," Vegas told the official PGA Tour website.
"But to actually make it happen -- that is something else, and it's a crazy feeling," he added.
"I hope this means a lot to my country. I really hope it means people changing their minds about the sport," continued Vegas -- who collected a near $1m winner's cheque as well as a two-year Tour exemption and an invitation to the Masters in April.
Vegas' win is expected to boost his desire to revive golf in Venezuela, where  President Hugo Chavez has decried the sport as a pastime of the rich and has closed six courses in seven years.
"I hope Venezuelans know about the story and that it is possible to get to the PGA Tour and win," Vegas added. "I hope people realize that all over the world."
Haas, who was trying to become the first back-to-back Bob Hope champion since Johnny Miller in 1976, fired a final round 66 in the 90-hole tournament.
That meant he finished level with Vegas and Woodland, who both carded 69s, on a 27-under-par total of 233.
