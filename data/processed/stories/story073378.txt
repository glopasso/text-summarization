Rescue workers pulled a woman out of rubble near Haiti's national cathedral Tuesday, a week after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck.
The rescue crews believe two other people may be alive under wreckage nearby, in part because of a text message the crews believe was sent from under the rubble, a CNN crew reported.
Men carried the woman, Ena Zizi, who is in her 70s, from the rubble on a wooden board as she grasped its edges.
They took her to a nearby clinic, although it doesn't have the operating facilities needed to treat her, the CNN crew reported.
Zizi's right femur was fractured and she was in shock, the crew reported.

Her son, Maxime Janvier, told CNN that he never gave up hope that she'd be found.
"We were praying a lot for that to happen," he said.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday that about 90 victims have been saved by 43 international rescue teams, made up of some 1,700 people, in the days after the quake.
