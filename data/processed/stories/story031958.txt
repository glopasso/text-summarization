At least 37 people were killed following a bus crash west of Nairobi, Kenya, police said Thursday.
The wreck took place in the predawn hours in Ntulele, when the bus overturned on the Nairobi-Narok highway.
At least 32 others suffered multiple injuries and were evacuated to a district hospital, police said.
Earlier, the Red Cross had reported 41 killed in the mishap, citing police.
Between 3,000 and 13,000 people die in road accidents in Kenya every year, the World Health Organization says.
Most of the victims are motorcyclists and pedestrians, but one third of them are vehicle passengers often riding on unsafe public transportation.
Road safety laws are lacking, the WHO says.
"There are no laws for helmet wearing, blood alcohol concentration levels for drivers or child restraints in Kenya and where road safety laws do exist they are poorly enforced."
The WHO says that main roads between Nairobi and the eastern part of the country -- such as the Nairobi-Narok highway -- are very dangerous.
Speeding is a particular problem.
