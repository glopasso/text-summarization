Two Egyptians allegedly tried to set themselves on fire but security guards stopped them from carrying out the acts, an Egyptian Interior Ministry official confirmed to CNN Wednesday.
The incidents occurred in Cairo Tuesday, and both men were arrested on suspicion of trying to burn themselves.
Sayed Ali Sayed, a 65-year-old retired accountant, was stopped outside the Egyptian parliament building by guards who found him carrying gas canisters, said the official, who wants to remain anonymous because he's not authorized to speak to the media. Sayed's motives are not known.
Mohamed Ashour Mohamed, a 53-year-old former EgyptAir employee, attempted to set himself ablaze in protest to being fired three years ago. The man said a court order to give him his job back was never enforced, the official said.
The men's attempts are the latest in a series of self-immolation incidents that began last month in restive Tunisia, when Mohamed Bouazizi, a 26-year-old unemployed college graduate, set himself on fire after police took away his fruit cart.
Since then, more such incidents are being reported from other countries such as Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania -- where other people are turning to self-immolation, some for apparent social and personal reasons.
In an incident Monday night, Ahmed Hashem Sayed, a 25-year-old unemployed construction worker in Alexandria, Egypt, slashed his wrists, set himself on fire, and died of his injuries, the Egyptian Interior Ministry official said.
Two others in Egypt were injured in self-immolation attempts, one on Tuesday and the other on Monday.
News reports from Mauritania say a man set himself on fire Monday in front of the presidential palace. In Algeria, security officials said Sunday that three people set themselves on fire. Riots and demonstrations have erupted in Algeria in recent weeks due to the rising cost of food, unemployment and housing issues.
