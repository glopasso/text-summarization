Britain's Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to charge England international footballer John Terry with racist abuse after receiving a full police file on the Chelsea captain.
London's Metropolitan Police confirmed this week that Terry was questioned under caution last Friday over claims that he abused Anton Ferdinand of Queens Park Rangers during a match in October.
The 30-year-old has strongly denied the accusation, but faces investigations by both the police and the English Football Association.
He has continued to play for both club and country, including this month's friendly win against Sweden when he retained the captain's armband.
"We now have a full file on John Terry and that is now under consideration," a spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed to CNN on Thursday.
Terry's case is one of two that have rocked English football in recent months, and came shortly before FIFA president Sepp Blatter told CNN that there is no problem with on-pitch racism.
Liverpool's Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez has been charged by the FA over allegedly racist remarks he made to Manchester United's Senegal-born France international Patrice Evra during a Premier League match on October 15.
Liverpool announced that Suarez would plead his innocence.
