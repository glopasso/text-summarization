Welcome to our first show of 2015! It covers subjects past, present and future, as we catch you up on some headlines that happened over the holidays and take a look at how scientists predict impending health events. We report on how the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan is changing, and we take a look at the technological accuracy of the "Back to the Future" series.
