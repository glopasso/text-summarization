Iraq's foreign ministry summoned the Turkish ambassador in Baghdad on Thursday to deliver a diplomatic letter protesting Turkey's aerial and artillery bombardment of northern Iraq.
Turkish armed forces have been striking what the country calls PKK safe havens in Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region.
About 90 to 100 Kurdish rebel fighters have been killed since the incursion started, Turkey said Tuesday.
Around 80 people have been wounded in the push, the military said.
Targets included rebel barracks, caves, ammunition depots and anti-aircraft positions in the region, part of Iraq's Kurdish autonomous region.
On Sunday night, a PKK spokesman said no rebels had been killed. PKK refers to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, which the United States considers a terror group.
Dozens of Turkish soldiers have been killed over the last month, in a clear escalation of the conflict that has raged intermittently between Kurdish separatists and the Turkish state since 1984.
More than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict, many of them ethnic Kurds. The Kurds are Turkey's largest ethnic minority.
