Gunmen killed seven people Wednesday in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province, and two more died in a bomb blast in Karachi, police said.
The Karachi explosion resulted from a bomb planted near an illegal gambling and drug center, according to police official Muhammad Aslam. It was not immediately clear who placed the bomb.
In Balochistan, four people died in Loop Sherani when gunmen on two motorcycles sprayed a vehicle with what police official Abdul Jabbar Baloch called "indiscriminate firing." The shooting appeared to be a targeted killing, he said.
In the other Balochistan incident, gunmen killed three people in Quetta, the provincial capital. Deputy Inspector General Wazir Khan Nasar said gunmen had earlier kidnapped the victims, who were later shot repeatedly in the head from close range.
Balochistan, Pakistan's largest province, is routinely racked with violence.
This month, 97 people have died in bombings in the province, leading to protests among Shiites who complain that the government has done too little to protect them.
In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban.
