(CNN)  -- [Updated 3 p.m. ET, Monday, August 29] These beachgoers are enjoying themselves on Isola dei Conigli ("Rabbit Island") in Lampedusa, Italy.
Lampedusa is the southernmost part of Italy, in the Mediterranean Sea between the Sicilian mainland and North Africa. Since the Arab unrest began earlier this year, thousands of people from Libya and other parts of North Africa have sought refuge there.
Contrary to its name, Rabbit Island is probably more renowned for turtles. It is one of the last remaining egg-laying sites in Italy for the endangered loggerhead sea turtle.
Nobody answered Rabbit Island in our photo challenge this week, but there were some close guesses of Sardinia, Italy, as well as some generic guesses of the Mediterranean.
[Original post] Do you know where this photo was taken?
If you think you know the answer -- or if you just want to take a wild guess -- post it in the comments area below. Later in the day, we'll reveal where the photo was taken and give credit to those who figured it out first. (The more detail, the better!)
Each Monday morning, we'll post a new photo and challenge you to tell us its origin. The photo might be related to a prominent news story or theme -- or it might just be something that caught our eye.
Good luck!
