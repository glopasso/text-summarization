A possible tornado damaged several buildings Thursday at the Ohio State University satellite campus in Wooster, Ohio, the National Weather Service and local fire officials said.
The storm destroyed greenhouses and outer structures at the Agricultural Research and Developmental Center, said Capt. Rody Walter of the Wooster Fire Department.
Other campus buildings were damaged, as well as residences. One home reportedly collapsed.
There were no fatalities, Walter said. People with minor injuries were treated on scene and at Wooster Community Hospital.
