Add another name to the list of political observers who think a Clinton-Obama ticket would be unbeatable: Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
Cuban President Fidel Castro, shown in a file photo, says a Clinton-Obama ticket in 2008 would be "invincible."
In an editorial in Cuba's communist party newspaper, Granma, the ailing dictator called the pairing of the two White House hopefuls "invincible," according to an English translation on the paper's Web site.
Castro, who has overseen communist rule of Cuba since 1959, did, however, make it clear that he is no fan of the two Democrats' support of democratic reform in Cuba.
"Both of them feel the sacred duty of demanding 'a democratic government in Cuba,'" Castro wrote. "They are not making politics: they are playing a game of cards on a Sunday afternoon."
The two Democratic candidates actually disagree over America's policy toward Cuba.
Obama, a senator from Illinois, wants to grant Cuban-Americans "unrestricted rights to visit family and send remittances to the island."  Such activities are strictly limited by current U.S. policy.
Meanwhile, Clinton, New York's junior senator, said through a spokesman that "we cannot talk about changes to U.S. policy" unless and until Castro passes from the scene and a new government demonstrates its intentions.
Castro also weighed in on the "will-he-or-won't-he" debate on former Vice President Al Gore's potential candidacy.
"I don't think he will do so," Castro said, but added that Gore, "better than anyone, he knows about the kind of catastrophe that awaits humanity if it continues along its current course."
Castro was not, however, entirely full of praise for the 2000 Democratic nominee, conceding, "When he was a candidate, he of course committed the error of yearning for "a democratic Cuba."
Castro, 81, has not appeared in public in over a year. Intestinal problems forced him to hand over power of the island to his brother, Raul, in July, 2006. E-mail to a friend
