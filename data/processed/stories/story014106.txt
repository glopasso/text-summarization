(CNN)"Fast Times at Ridgemont High" actor and comedian Taylor Negron has died after a long battle with cancer.  He was 57.
Cousin Chuck Negron, the former lead singer for 1970s band Three Dog Night, announced his death.
"I want to inform you that my cousin Taylor Negron just passed away," he said in a YouTube video posted Saturday.  "His mother, his brother, Alex, and my brother, Rene, and his wife ... were all there with him. May he rest in peace."
If you're having trouble placing Negron, think back to the iconic pizza delivery scene in 1982's "Fast Times at Ridgemont High."  He was the guy who interrupted Mr. Hand's class to drop off a pizza for Jeff Spicoli, played by a young Sean Penn.
