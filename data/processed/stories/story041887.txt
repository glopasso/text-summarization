Fenerbahce recently suspended negotiations over a fresh deal with Zico because of reportedly high demands by the Brazilian.
The Anatolia press agency published a club statement which said: "The contract of Arthur Antunes Coimbra (Zico) has now come to an end.
" We would like to thank him for the successful work he has done with the club, and wish him all the best for the future."
Last season Zico led Fenerbahce to the quarterfinals of the Champions League where they were defeated by Chelsea.
Reports claimed that after that achievement Zico sought a new annual salary of $4.9 million. He has been earning $2.9million..
Zico, 55, joined the club in July 2006 on a two-year deal and he guided them to a league and Turkish Super Cup double in 2007, their centenary year.
Spanish media reports have said that Fenerbahce have lined up current Spain coach Luis Aragones as a replacement.
