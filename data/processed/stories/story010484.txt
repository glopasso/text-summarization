(CNN)A grand jury has indicted the man accused of killing three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Craig Hicks, 46, was indicted on three counts of first-degree murder, according to the Durham County Clerk's office. He was also charged with discharging a firearm into an occupied dwelling.
Police said "an ongoing neighbor dispute over parking" might have been a factor in last week's shootings but also said they weren't dismissing the possibility of a hate crime.
On what is believed to be Hicks' Facebook page, numerous posts rail against religion. The victims' family members have called on authorities to investigate the slayings as a hate crime.
The FBI is looking into that possibility.
Hicks is expected to make his first appearance after the grand jury indictment in Superior Court the first week of March.
When is a crime a 'hate crime'?
