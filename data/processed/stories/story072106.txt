(CNN)Parts of Miami-Dade County's skyline was hidden from view Monday as smoke from a growing 1,850-acre wildfire loomed over portions of the Florida county.
What started as a nonthreatening and seemingly shrinking grass fire on Sunday, consuming fewer than 100 acres according to Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Al Cruz, grew to be more than 10 times that within the next 24 hours.
By Monday night, the fire had burned nearly 2,000 acres and was 50% contained, the fire department said.
High temperatures and gusty winds helped the fire spread, State Forester Jim Karels said.
Several fire units and a helicopter with the capacity to drop 400 gallons of water at a time were battling the blaze, Cruz said.
"The Florida Forest Service and Miami-Dade Fire Rescue have worked around the clock to protect Southwest Miami-Dade County," Florida Agriculture Commissioner Adam H. Putnam said in a statement.
Early Monday night, officials were considering road closures, and one school, Lincoln Marti, was evacuated as a precaution, according to the Fire Department.
