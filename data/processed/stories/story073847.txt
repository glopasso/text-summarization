The U.S. Army battalion commander killed in a shooting at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, was a highly decorated veteran who served multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, the military said Saturday.
Lt. Col. Roy L. Tisdale, 42, of Alvin, Texas, was killed Thursday by a soldier in his battalion who opened fire during a safety briefing, according to a statement released by base officials.
"Tisdale was killed immediately and the unit member reportedly turned the weapon upon himself, causing life-threatening injuries," the statement said.
The military has not released a possible motive in the shooting, though a defense official said Tisdale was shot by a soldier in his battalion.
The alleged shooter, a specialist, was facing court martial after being accused of stealing a tool box worth nearly $2,000 from a motor pool, and faced dishonorable discharge if found guilty, said the official, who did not want to be named. The official is not authorized to speak to the media.
The battalion commander had gathered his unit Thursday afternoon for a safety briefing that was really more of a "stay safe" talk before the July 4th weekend, the official said.
During the talk, the specialist pulled out a gun and started shooting, then shot himself, the official said.
The alleged shooter had once served on the battalion commander's security detail during a tour in Afghanistan, the official said.
The alleged shooter, whose identity has not been released, was in critical condition and not expected to survive, the official said.
A third soldier, identified as Spec. Michael E. Latham, was treated for minor wounds, base officials said.
Tisdale took control of the Fort Bragg-based 525th Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 525th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade, in January.
Among military honors he earned was a Bronze Star, a Purple Heart and an Army Commendation Medal, according to base officials.
