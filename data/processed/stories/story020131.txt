Raspberry Pi, the tiny, ultra-cheap, Linux-based PC, went on sale Monday in the U.S. through retailer Allied Electronics, but it's already out of stock.
The A version of the computer, which only costs $25, has 256MB of RAM, a single USB 2.0 socket, an HDMI, SD card, and 3.5 audio sockets, but no Ethernet port. Available only through Allied, the A is now completely out of stock for U.S. customers.
The $35 Raspberry Pi B is also out of stock at Allied, but it can be bought through Newark, another retailer, which only carries that particular model.
Why everybody wants a slice of Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi's more powerful version has 512MB of RAM, two USB 2.0 sockets and an Ethernet port.
Both the A and B are equipped with an ARM processor and are amazingly small â€” approximately the size of a credit card â€” making them suitable for a variety of applications in education and DIY systems.
Raspberry Pi A launched in Europe in February of last year to heavy demand, followed by a launch in Asia last week.
