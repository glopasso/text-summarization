Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew have met to discuss concerns that more revelations could surface about the prince's friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. financier who was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution, according to a royal source who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Prince Andrew's office recently declined to comment when asked about the prince's friendship with Epstein.
Also called the Duke of York, Prince Andrew is Queen Elizabeth's second son and the brother of Prince Charles, who is next in line to the throne. He also is the United Kingdom's special representative for international trade and investment.
The queen and Prince Andrew discussed Epstein, the royal source said, but details about their talk were not immediately available. The British government periodically reviews the prince's position. The next meeting is scheduled to happen this summer.
Some politicians and royal commentators have said that Prince Andrew is an embarrassment to Britain and the royal family.
In leaked diplomatic documents published by WikiLeaks last year, the U.S. ambassador in the central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan, Tatiana Gfoeller, reportedly said that the prince -- during a business lunch in 2008 -- was "astonishingly candid. The discussion at times verged on the rude (from the British side)."
The prince has not commented publicly on characterizations put forth in the leaked documents.
"[Prince] Andrew hasn't really done the royal family any favors," said royal historian Christopher Warwick. "As fourth in line to the throne, he is a senior member of the royal family."
"All members of the royal family have an ambassadorial responsibility, particularly the senior members. Part of the royal remit is to take the monarchy abroad and wave the flag for Britain plc. We have to recognize how immensely marvelous the queen is, she's never put a foot wrong," he added.
