Jennifer Lawrence gives everything her all -- even lip-syncing.
The Oscar winning actress gave a showstopping performance in 2013's "American Hustle," but there's one scene that we're just now getting to fully appreciate.
In the David O. Russell dramedy, Lawrence plays Rosalyn Rosenfeld, a '70s housewife with a penchant for belting out the era's hits while scrubbing down her home.
In the movie, Lawrence sings along to Wings' "Live and Let Die" with such fervor it left us wishing she had a second career as a cover band frontwoman.
But it gets even better: it turns out Lawrence also filmed a scene with Santana's 1969 track "Evil Ways" as the song of choice.
The sequence didn't make it into the final film, but the DVD/Blu-ray, released on March 18, includes extended outtakes like this one:
Clearly, we've been approaching housecleaning in the wrong way. It seems it's best done with solo dancing and the most sincere lip-syncing this side of a pop star's concert.
Lawrence may have lost out on a best supporting actress Oscar for her "American Hustle" role -- that went to Lupita Nyong'o for "12 Years A Slave" -- but she's won the Internet with this performance.
