Chelsea Clinton is waiting to find out the gender of her baby because, as she told CNN's Fareed Zakaria, "there are so few mysteries in life... in which any answer is a happy one."
Clinton and her husband, Marc Mezvinsky, announced in April they were expecting their first child.
But no other details were given -- such as the due date or the gender of the baby.
Recently, when any member of the Clinton family was asked about the sex of the child, they have said they don't know because the couple wants to be surprised.
"My husband and I decided we would enjoy this mystery for, you know, the nine-plus months that we were granted," Chelsea Clinton said during a panel discussion on Ebola with Zakaria Tuesday. "And we are eager to find out what God will have given us."
"Isn't it strange that the doctors around you know, but you don't know?" Zakaria asked.
"No," she said. "I think the doctors around me know lots of things that I don't know."
Chelsea is Bill and Hillary Clinton's only child, and the focus on her first baby -- and the Clintons' first grandchild -- has been intense.
Even President Barack Obama weighed in, jokingly telling the audience at the Clinton Global Initiative Tuesday that if Chelsea went into labor while he was nearby, "she has my motorcade and will be able to navigate traffic."
Earlier this week, Bill Clinton dropped a baby hint when he told CNN that he hopes to be a grandfather "by the first of October." Until then, the Clintons had kept Chelsea's due date a secret.
Chelsea Clinton's full panel interview with Zakaria will air Sunday at 10 a.m. ET.
