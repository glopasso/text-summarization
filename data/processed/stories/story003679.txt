It's not going to be Batman versus Superman versus Captain America after all.
"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" and "Captain America 3" were both set to arrive in theaters May 6, 2016, but Warner Bros' Caped Crusader/Man of Steel showdown will be released March 25, 2016 instead, EW has confirmed.
The Zack Snyder-directed film will star Henry Cavill as Superman, Ben Affleck as Batman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, and Jeremy Irons as Alfred.
