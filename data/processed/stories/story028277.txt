A member of the Secret Service was arrested in Miami early Friday after a run-in with a patrolman, city police said.
The incident occurred after President Obama campaigned in the city Thursday.
Police spotted Aaron Francis Engler lying down on a street corner, according to a police report, and an officer roused him to help him sit up and stand.
He had difficulty standing, the officer said, and had bloodshot eyes, "slurred speech, and a strong odor of alcohol" on his breath.
Engler argued and threw his arms around as the officer patted him down, the report said. And when the officer tried to handcuff him, he hit the officer's face, tensed his arm and pulled away. He then turned on his back and hit the officer's chin.
The officer called for backup, and two other officers arrived and helped handcuff Engler, authorities said. The arrest occurred at 7 a.m. Engler is accused of disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest without violence.
Miami police said he was released to members of the Secret Service Miami field office.
The Secret Service says its Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting an internal review of the incident.
Obama had delivered remarks at the University of Miami and the JW Marriott Marquis Miami.
