Expressing apologies that she can't accompany him to prom on his birthday, country music beauty Taylor Swift on Friday asked an 18-year-old student with cancer to be her date to the Academy of Country Music Awards in April.
Kevin McGuire was diagnosed with leukemia in 2007 at the age of 13. The cancer was in remission for years before a recent relapse.
Realizing he would lose his hair because of treatment, McGuire was worried about securing a date.
His older sister, Victoria, asked, "What if I got Taylor Swift?"
She started a Facebook page on Tuesday that went viral overnight, garnering more than 93,000 likes and the attention of Swift herself.
In a message left on the Facebook page, Swift said, "Kevin, I'm so sorry but I won't be able to make it to your prom. But I was wondering, the ACM Awards are coming up. Would you be my date?"
Representatives for Swift confirmed that the message was posted by the singer.
McGuire has a fever and is extremely ill, so he won't be able to participate in a YouTube video Victoria and his younger brother planned on making in response to Swift.
McGuire, a New Jersey high school student, will be in and out of the hospital the remainder of his senior year and turns 19 on prom night, according to his sister. Taylor Swift won't be his prom queen, but, if he accepts, he'll be going as her date to the Academy of Country Music Awards come April 1.
