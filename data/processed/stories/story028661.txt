A suicide attack by the Pakistani Taliban on the compound of an enemy militant commander in northwest Pakistan killed at least 17 people and wounded 22 others Thursday, authorities said.
The attack took place at the compound of Mullah Nabi Hanfi, who had been supporting government forces fighting against the Taliban, in Orakzai Agency, one of seven volatile semi-autonomous tribal districts near the Afghan border.
Local police official Shaukat Ali Shah said the Taliban attackers had driven an explosive-laden vehicle at the compound early Thursday, causing large-scale damage.
It wasn't immediately clear whether Hanfi had been hurt in the attack or how many of his fighters were among those killed.
At least one woman and one child were reported to be among the dead, Shaukat said.
Security forces sealed off the area after the attack and the wounded were taken to local hospitals as reports of another possible suicide attack were received.
Hanfi turned against the Pakistani Taliban after developing differences with its leadership and formed his own group. Since parting ways, both groups have frequently targeted each other.
Pakistani Taliban spokesman Shaidulalh Shaid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying anyone who opposes to the group's ideology and fights against it would be on its hit list.
The area where the Thursday attack took place, on the border of Orakzai Agency and Hangu District, is off limits for police and other government law enforcement agencies.
