The families of two boys allegedly shot to death by a U.S. consular employee as they tried to rob him have filed a complaint with Lahore police against the American, accusing him of two murders, a police spokesman said.
Nayab Haider said the complaint, called a "first information report," triggers an official investigation by police, who will submit their findings to a court. The court then will decide on what, if any, charges will be filed.
The American was driving in a busy area known as Kartaba Chawk when two boys on a motorcycle tried to rob him, said another police official, Faisal Rana. The American shot both boys, he said.
Rana identified the American as Raymond Davis.
Alberto Rodriguez, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, confirmed that the man involved in the shooting is an employee of the U.S. consulate but did not confirm his identity.
Rodriguez also said he could not confirm details of the police account.
Rana said the man surrendered to police and was in custody. Rodriguez, however, could not say whether the man was in police custody or whether he had been turned over to the consulate.
In addition, Rana said, a car from the U.S. consulate was involved in an accident that killed a motorcyclist while it was en route to the police station in response to the shooting incident.
