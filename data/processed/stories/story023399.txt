Mark Bell, who founded the highly influential techno music duo LFO and later collaborated with Bjork on several iconic albums, has died.
Bell died of complications after a surgery earlier this month, but the announcement of his death only came Monday via his label, Warp Records.
"It's with great sadness that we announce the untimely passing of Mark Bell of LFO who died last week from complications after an operation. Mark's family & friends request privacy at this difficult time," the statement read.
The label didn't offer details.
Bell founded LFO with Gez Varley in 1988, playing a pioneering role in the house and techno scene. Two years later, their self-titled single "LFO" reached the top 20 on the British charts.
The duo released two albums, "Frequencies" and "Advance," before Varley left.
Bell continued with the LFO name, releasing one more album in 2003, "Sheath." But by this time, he had branched out into producing work for others.
He collaborated with Icelandic singer Bjork on her seminal 1997 work, "Homogenic." Their singer-producer partnership continued through several albums, including 2011's "Biophilia."
Bell also produced Depeche Mode's "Exciter."
Following his death, Bjork posted LFO's "Love is the Message" on her Facebook page.
