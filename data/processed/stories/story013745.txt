IN FOCUS -- Role of Arab women
The Middle East is not normally recognized for having women at the forefront of business. According to the World Bank, 25% of women in the region participate in the labor force, compared to more than 50% in Sub-Saharan Africa, East Asia and the Pacific. But as MME finds out, women in the Arab World are making huge strides in business.
