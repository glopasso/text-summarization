(CNN)It comes as no surprise that Grammy-award winning artist Pharrell Williams has signed a deal for a book inspired by his song "Happy."
If his entrepreneurial endeavors are any indication of success, the picture book showcasing photographs of children across cultures "celebrating happiness" will surely be a hit.
Clearly the publishing company has already caught onto this. After Williams signed the book deal for "Happy!" with Putnam Books for Young Readers, three more books were negotiated with the soon-to-be children's author.
"I'm humbled by the global success of 'Happy,' but especially in awe of the song's young fans," Williams said in a press release announcing the deal. "My collaboration with Penguin allows me to continue a dialogue with these children in a fresh, new way. We're both committed to feeding the curiosity of young minds with imagination."
Be it the music he makes, the songs he sings or the vintage Vivienne Westwood hat he sports, Williams is constantly coming up with original ideas that stick.
The book deal comes after Williams' recent Grammy wins including best pop solo performance and best music video for his hit song, "Happy." The book is due to publish in September.
