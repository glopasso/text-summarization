One woman was killed and another injured after they fell from a 10th-floor window at an Atlanta hotel, authorities said Saturday.
According to Atlanta Police, witnesses said the two were attending a birthday party early Saturday at the W Atlanta-Midtown.
The pair were "play fighting" when they accidentally crashed through the window around 3:15 a.m., according to a preliminary investigation, said department spokesman Officer John Chafee. It was unclear Saturday where they landed.
The Fulton County medical examiner identified the woman who died at the scene as LaShawna M. Threatt of Atlanta. The cause of death is pending. The other woman, who was unidentified, was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in critical condition.
Hotel manager Michael O'Donohue said information on the investigation must come from authorities.
"The incident at the W Atlanta early Saturday is very tragic and our thoughts and prayers are with the woman who was injured and the family and friends of the woman who died in the fall," he said in a statement.
