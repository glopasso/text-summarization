Emmanuel Adebayor has praised the impact Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has had on his career, following his loan move from Manchester City last month.
The Togo international striker was out of the first team picture under Roberto Mancini at City, but has already scored two goals since moving to the Bernabeu on loan, with the Spanish giants having an option to make the move permanent at the end of the season.
Speaking to the club's official website, the former Arsenal and Monaco forward said: "It is very easy to work with Jose Mourinho. He is an excellent person and he enhances my game.
"He has his own way of dealing with people. He tells you what he expects you to do," added Adebayor.
Although the 26-year-old did not completely rule out a return to the English Premier League with City, he admitted he was loving life in Spain, despite not speaking the language.
"I want to thank my Real Madrid teammates for helping me to adapt so easily to this league championship," Adebayor continued.
"Granero, Ramos, Ronaldo, Pepe, and Marcelo all speak English, so they understand me and I understand them. I am very happy to be here in Madrid."
