The young seamstress who survived 17 days in the rubble of a collapsed factory building got a new job Thursday -- a five-star hotel said it had hired her as its "public area ambassador."
"We are proud to have her on board with us. I hope we can together create a good future and career for this young woman," Westin Dhaka Hotel General Manager Azeem Shah said of 19-year-old Reshma. Like many women in Bangladesh, she goes goes by one name.
Reshma had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since her rescue on May 10, and she accepted the new job in the housekeeping department of the Starwood Hotels and Resorts facility when she was released Thursday.
"I am really happy to join here," Reshma told reporters at the hotel, where she met with media.
Reshma surprised searchers and workers clearing rubble at the collapsed Rana Plaza building when she cried out for help in a faint voice more than two weeks after the nine-story structure fell, killing 1,130 people and injuring more than 2,400.
Rescuers pulled her from a dark chamber under remnants of the factory where she had worked as a sewing-machine operator. She said she survived on some water in a bottle she found and four crackers.
"The people who were with me under the rubble died. I heard people screaming. 'Save me, save me,' they screamed. But I couldn't find them. I tried," Reshma said after her rescue.
Five apparel factories at Rana Plaza made clothes for various brands, including British discount fashion retailer Primark and Canada's Loblaw Cos Ltd as well as Spanish retailer Mango.
