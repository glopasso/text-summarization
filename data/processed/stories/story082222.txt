(CNN)UPDATE: Jonathan Hyla said in an phone interview Monday that his interview with Cate Blanchett was mischaracterized when an edited version went viral around the Web last week. "She wasn't upset," he told CNN. "When you watch the entire interview in the full context, you can see she instigates a lot of the ridiculousness that ensues in the interview."
Blanchett ended the interview laughing, Hyla said, and "she was in on the joke."

If you're going to interview Cate Blanchett, please have some good questions prepared.
Blanchett was talking to Jonathan Hyla of the Australian TV show "The Project" in conjunction with "Cinderella," but Hyla's offbeat questions led to an awkward few minutes.
Hyla thought he'd begin the interview on a casual note, saying Blanchett would be a good person to have a beer with.
Blanchett was having none of it.
"This date is not going well; I do not drink beer," she responded.
After some more back-and-forth, with an apparently sometimes testy, sometimes punchy Blanchett trying to steer the topic of conversation back to the film, Hyla finally tried another angle.
"How were you able to get that cat to do what you wanted (it) to do on a leash?" he asked about a cat Blanchett's nasty stepmother has in the film. "I tried to put my girlfriend's cat on a leash, and it just never works for me."
That was enough for Blanchett.
"That's your question? That's your f***ing question?" she asked.
She stood up and awkwardly presented her hand. The interview was over.
Hyla took it well. He later posted that it was "the best worst interview I've ever done."
Hyla later tweeted the unedited interview after an edited version went viral.
