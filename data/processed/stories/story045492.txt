In Twitter's popularity contest, Katy Perry is the new queen bee.
The 29-year-old pop star has edged out Justin Bieber as the most popular person on the social networking site, boasting 46,529,319 followers in comparison to Bieber's 46,507,829 on Monday morning.
While the public's opinion on Bieber is typically divided, the 19-year-old singer has reigned supreme on Twitter after passing Lady Gaga as the most popular on the site in January.
The Mother Monster now has the third most followed account with 40,400,759 followers, according to TwitterCounter.com, putting her ahead of President Barack Obama.
Neither Bieber nor Perry immediately noted the Twitter shake-up, although Bieber has had a busy weekend. Following a set of performances in Brazil -- and some eyebrow-raising allegations from the New York Post's Page Six  -- the Canadian crooner was preparing to release a new song on Monday.
The track's ironically appropriate title? "Bad Day."
