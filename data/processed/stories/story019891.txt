One of the people arrested as part of a police investigation into drugs found in actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment was given a no-jail-time plea deal on Tuesday, according to his attorney.
Daniel Hochheiser, attorney for Max Rosenblum, said his client received two years on probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance.
Conditions of the probation include that Rosenblum continue to attend an outpatient program.
"It's a blessing," Hochheiser said. "He's gotten a second chance to remain at liberty and now he can focus on his rehabilitation, education and his bright future."
Hoffman, an Academy Award-winning actor, was found dead February 2 of an apparent drug overdose. Investigators found close to 50 packets of what they believe to be heroin in the actor's apartment. Police set out to track Hoffman's heroin source.
Rosenblum, 22, was among four people arrested in a drug raid on February 4. Police recovered 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin, law enforcement officials said. The bags were branded "black list" and "red bull," not the same brands found in Hoffman's apartment, the officials said.
"He's never met, spoken to, seen, had anything to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman," Hochheiser said last month of his client. "My client is in no way connected to Mr. Hoffman's overdose and there has been no evidence presented that I know of that connects my client to Mr. Hoffman in any way, except that he lived in a building which apparently Mr. Hoffman frequented a different apartment to do whatever he did."
