President Barack Obama said Wednesday the United States and its allies have "made real progress" in talks with Iran over its nuclear program, but "significant gaps" remain and more work is necessary.
He added in remarks at the White House that more time may be needed to continue talks beyond the July 20 deadline for a comprehensive agreement.
Obama said he would continue consultations, including discussions with Congress, about whether to extend the negotiations.
Obama met with John Kerry at the White House earlier in the day to review the secretary of state's discussions in recent days with other world powers negotiating with Iran along with the United States.
An interim deal that took effect in January required Iran to dismantle or freeze some of its nuclear program and open it to more international inspections in return for limited relief from crippling international sanctions.
Obama said that Iran has met its commitments under the interim accord.
