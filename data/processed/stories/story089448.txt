Or was it something the clearly amused president said?
Or maybe it was something both of them said.
Maybe it was her lunch.
But because there's no audio from the exchange, it's hard to tell what prompted the reaction that caught fire on the Internet.
We thought we'd leave it up to you. What do you think the first lady was thinking?
