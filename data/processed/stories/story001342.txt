(EW.com) -- In light of "Community's" return tomorrow night, the rocky relationship between the show and one of its stars, Chevy Chase (who has since left the show) became the topic of discussion for Joel McHale and Howard Stern on Stern's Sirius/XM radio show.
McHale said that Chase had no desire to be involved in the show, and when he attempted to talk to him about it, there were repercussions.
"When I would try, he would just try to fight me. He physically wanted to fight me," McHale tells Stern in this clip.
Tensions boiled over last year, after months of reports that Chase had acted out on set, insulting the show's writing and sending former showrunner Dan Harmon an insulting voicemail that was leaked online.
McHale told Stern that Chase did use the 'n'-word on set.

"When he said it, it was like 'We are now at Defcon 1,'" McHale said.
He added that Chase was protesting the direction that his character, Pierce, was going in on the show claiming that his racist rants were sure to include the 'n'-word in the future.

"He said that Richard Pryor said it was okay for him to call him that," McHale said. "He literally ... he used that."
