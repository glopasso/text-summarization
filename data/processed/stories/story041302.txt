It's been the same story, 10 weeks running: Better luck next time, pal.
Could Friday turn the tide for the twice-weekly Mega Millions drawing, which has rolled over 20 times now since the 45-state lottery generated a winner?
As always, it's anybody's 1-in-259 million guess. Those are the odds of winning Friday's estimated $400 million jackpot.
Although five tickets in Tuesday's drawing matched the first five numbers, netting $1 million each, none of the tickets purchased for Tuesday's measly $344 million jackpot matched all six numbers.
Mega Millions estimates Friday's jackpot will be the fifth-largest in North America. And while it is a whopping big pile of money, Friday's projected jackpot wouldn't qualify to move into the ultra-tony neighborhood occupied by the record draw.
That $656 million jackpot, won on March 30, 2012, was split by winning tickets in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.
The Mega Millions jackpot numbers will be drawn Friday at 11 p.m. ET.
