Four people were killed Thursday afternoon and two others were injured in a gun and knife attack at a Native American tribal office in Alturas, California, police chief Ken Barnes said.
Sherrie Rhoades, 44, was attending a tribal eviction meeting at the Cedarville Rancheria tribal office Thursday around 3:30 p.m. when she opened fire, Barnes said.
When Rhoades ran out of ammunition she grabbed a butcher knife from the kitchen and attacked another person, stabbing them, Barnes said.
A person at the meeting ran out of the building covered in blood and went to the Alturas police station to alert officers, Barnes said.
Police said they found Rhoades outside the building, running with a knife in her hands. She was taken into custody.
The deceased victims were identified as a 19-year-old woman, a 45-year-old woman, a 30-year-old man and a 50-year-old man.
Rhoades, a former tribal leader, was at the hearing because she was facing eviction, police said.
The shooting happened in Modoc County, which is in Northern California on the Oregon border.
Autopsies on those killed are scheduled for Friday.
The two who were injured by gunshots were transported to out-of-area hospitals and are in critical condition, Barnes told reporters.
"At this time, there doesn't appear to be any threat to the community," he said.
CNN first learned of the shooting on Twitter.
