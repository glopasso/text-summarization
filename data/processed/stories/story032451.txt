An intruder was shot and killed at the home of a deputy district attorney and her sheriff's-deputy husband in Hot Sulphur Springs, Colorado, just before midnight Monday, according to a statement from the Colorado Bureau of Investigations.
Grand County Coroner Brenda Bock identified the man as Joshua Stevens, 31. It appears he was shot once in the head and several times in the torso. A full autopsy will be done Wednesday, she said.
Bock told CNN she thinks Stevens was unarmed.
He had moved to Colorado recently from Michigan, his father said. Stevens was living with friends while looking for a job.
The deputy district attorney called police after the stranger caused a disturbance outside the front door of the couple's home, the news release said. The man tired to push his way into the home, and there was an altercation during which shots were fired.
"There are no apparent ties to recent shootings" of other legal-system officials in Colorado and Texas, the statement said.
It was unclear whether the deputy district attorney or her husband, a deputy with the Grand County Sheriff's Department, who shot the intruder.
