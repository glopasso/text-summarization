A rookie police officer who was answering a domestic violence call has died from gunshot wounds, the Flagstaff, Arizona, Police Department said Saturday.
Officer Tyler Stewart, 24, was shot several times in a residential area and died at a hospital, officials said.
The gunman apparently killed himself, police said.
"We are a very close-knit organization, and know that all members of the Flagstaff Police Department are grieving at this time," Chief Kevin Treadway said.
A news release said that Stewart was trying to make contact with the gunman, who was the suspect in a domestic violence investigation, when he was shot Saturday afternoon. There were no other details released.
"It is heartbreaking to lose one of our officers. We collectively mourn for his family and the entire department," Mayor Jerry Nabours said.
According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund website, Stewart is one of 125 police officers who have died while on duty in 2014.
