Spain's Marc Marquez claimed a 10th pole position in 12 attempts this season at qualifying for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on Saturday.
The Honda rider, who currently leads the MotoGP championship by 77 points, was 0.311 faster than his nearest rival, Italy's Andrea Dovizioso.
The Ducati rider was narrowly quicker than Jorge Lorenzo who finished third -- the Spaniard will be looking to complete a third successive victory at the Silverstone circuit.
Lorenzo's compatriot Aleix Espargaro is one place further back in fourth with Marquez's nearest rival in the title race, Dani Pedrosa, finishing qualifying in fifth.
Marquez, who became the sport's youngest world champion last year, has utterly dominated 2014 winning the opening 10 races.
The only blot on an otherwise perfect season came at the Czech Republic MotoGP earlier this month where he finished fourth.
