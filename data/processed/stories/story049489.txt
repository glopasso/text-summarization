Zlatan Ibrahimovic may have cost Paris Saint-Germain $30 million, but you can get your own chunk of the Swedish striker for just $41.
A French restaurateur has unveiled "Le Zlatan", a monstrous 600 gram burger served up in homage to the moody PSG star.
While the real life Ibrahimovic can boast eight league titles in four different countries, his meaty equivalent is a mixture of minced beef and onions, bacon and three types of cheeses.
The stomach-busting meal is the brainchild of Jean-Philippe Grandin, manager of Doddy's Cafe in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris and an ardent PSG fan.
"We have a lot of homemade burgers on the menu, but I wanted to invent an extraordinary burger," Grandin told CNN. "I am a supporter of Paris Saint-Germain and at the restaurant we show all of the PSG matches."
Coming inside a chunky custom-made bun, "Le Zlatan" stands head and shoulders above the regular burgers on the menu, weighing in at over one kilogram, including 250 grams of bread and 300 grams of cheese.
Grandin says this reflects the supremacy of Sweden international Ibrahimovic, who has also played for Ajax, Inter Milan and Barcelona during a glittering career, over every player in Ligue 1.
"In our league we have an extraordinary player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic," added Grandin. "Zlatan is an amazing player, he is the biggest player in the French league."
And an extraordinary player deserves an extraordinary burger, which is pitched as a meal for two diners or a culinary Everest for one hardy, and hungry, soul.
With Ibrahimovic -- who scored 30 league goals during his first season with PSG -- extending his contract at the Parc des Princes until 2016, Grandin has no intention of immortalizing any other footballers in meat anytime soon.
"For the moment nobody can match him," he concluded.
"There is just one extraordinary player, so I cannot make another extraordinary burger."
