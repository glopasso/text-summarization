CBS decided to pull Monday night's season finale of Mike & Molly, which talks about a tornado hitting Chicago (though no devastation was going to be shown).
"Due to the tragic events [Monday] afternoon in Oklahoma, we are pre-empting tonight's season finale of Mike & Molly, which has a related storyline," said a CBS spokesman. "A repeat broadcast of Mike & Molly will run in the time period. The season finale will be broadcast at an appropriate date."
Two men died after severe weather on Sunday triggered a frightening wave of tornadoes across Oklahoma, Kansas, Illinois and Iowa.
