Reality show star and White House party-crasher Michaele Salahi has been asked to leave the television show "Celebrity Rehab" because she does not have an addiction, VH1 said in a statement.
Salahi's manager shot back, saying the network knew that all along.
Salahi and her husband made news in November 2009 after attending President Barack Obama's first state dinner without an invitation.
VH1 said Tuesday it has canceled her appearance on the show, which chronicles celebrities undergoing treatment for alcohol and drug addictions.
"The treatment program that 'Celebrity Rehab' documents is intended for individuals with serious substance abuse and addiction issues," VH1 said in a statement Tuesday night.
"Prior to the taping of the current season, producers were advised that Michaele Salahi met the criteria to be treated in this setting. However, professional assessments spanning from that time to the present, found that she did not meet such criteria."
However, the show knew that in advance, according to Gina Rodriguez, her manager.
"That is the excuse they used. But they knew what it was when they cast her," Rodriguez said.
The Virginia couple slipped through White House security and shook hands with Obama, and had their pictures taken with Vice President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Salahi has also appeared on "Real Housewives of DC."
