A suspected drug kingpin on the "15 Most Wanted" fugitives list has been arrested in Los Angeles, the U.S. Marshals Service announced Thursday.
Keith Hasson, 45, was arrested without incident Wednesday at an apartment northwest of downtown Los Angeles, between Burbank and Thousand Oaks, according to a statement from the Marshals Service. He is reputed to have been the leader of a nationwide cocaine and marijuana trafficking ring that operated from 1999 to 2005 and generated more than $20 million in cash and assets, the statement said.
Hasson was wanted on a 2005 open indictment from the U.S. District Court in New Mexico for conspiracy to distribute controlled substances, continuing criminal enterprise and conspiracy to launder money, according to the statement. His brother, Anthony Hasson, was convicted in the same case and was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
Keith Hasson was placed on the most-wanted fugitive list on June 6. His criminal history dates back to 1981 and includes arrests for attempted murder, robbery, assault with a deadly weapon, vehicle theft, burglary and possession with intent to distribute, according to the Marshals Service. He also is wanted for questioning in two gang-related killings.
Investigators say they believe Hasson had access to significant financial resources -- as well as far-flung family ties in the Southwest, Southeast and New York -- and was continuing to organize a criminal enterprise.
"Keith Hasson had a long run as a leader of a criminal organization," Geoff Shank, acting assistant director of the Investigative Operations Division for the U.S. Marshals Service, said in a written statement. "Thanks to the Marshals and their law enforcement partners, that long run has come to an end."
