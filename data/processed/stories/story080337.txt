Can't a little Missouri candy store have a little fun? Fat chance.
An offer by the Route 66 Candy Shoppe to hand out free fudge to anyone tipping the scales at more than 300 pounds has become a weighty issue in the Ozark town of Waynesville.
"FREE FUDGE for anyone over 300 pounds on Fat Tuesday! Walk, run, waddle or ride your motorized wheelchair down to the Route 66 Candy Shoppe! See you Tuesday!" says the store's Facebook page.
After all, isn't the idea behind Fat Tuesday to overindulge and have a bit of fun?
Former customer Deb Czuprynski isn't laughing.
"It made my blood boil," she told CNN affiliate KSPR. "It may be a joke to them but to other viewers they can't help it, some will die because of obesity, no one should ever make fun of it."
Shop owner Charley Dill, who's often been compared to the late roly poly actor Dom DeLuise and looks like he's had his hand in the candy jar a time or two, said it's just a fun way to celebrate Fat Tuesday.
"We are not trying to make a statement or do anything to offend anyone," he said. "We just thought it was a good way to invite people to come in and have a good laugh."
While the offer may not appeal to everyone, Dill said "fellow fatties" from Columbia -- about 100 miles away -- have told him they're loading up the car and plan to flock to his shop.
Dill even suggested future specials, like free candy for pregnant women on Labor Day.
