Reactions to Miley Cyrus at the VMAs: People are still having them!
Earlier this week, we heard what both Britney Spears and Paula Patton had to say about the performance. (Spoiler alert: They think she's just being Miley.) But while both those stars were shrugging their shoulders, another music legend was sharpening her claws.
"I'm not old-fashioned," Cher told USA Today in an interview published Tuesday. "She could have come out naked, and if she'd just rocked the house, I would have said, 'You go, girl.' It just wasn't done well. She can't dance, her body looked like hell, the song wasn't great, one cheek was hanging out. And, chick, don't stick out your tongue if it's coated."

Ouch! It's one thing to slam Miley's choice of outfit or sexually-charged behavior; it's quite another to question the girl's talent itself. And coming from someone who knows a thing or two about rockin' it while wearing revealing outfits — not to mention clearly visible buttocks — that comment is harsher still.

Evidently, Cyrus is taking Cher's burn in stride. She hasn't responded to Cher's words on social media, choosing instead to keep touting the phenomenal success of "Wrecking Ball," her latest single. ("#1 on Billboard. #1 on iTunes. #1 on Spotify. #1 on Streaming. #1 on Digital songs. #1 most added to pop radio. #1 on VEVO," according to Miley.)
And maybe it was the young star's high-road tactics — not to mention a barrage of criticism about her criticism — that prompted Cher to backtrack on Twitter yesterday. "What I should have said [is],"I didn't like it that much,but she's Pushing The Envelope,being an ARTIST !" the Oscar winner wrote. "She's Talented,& DIDNT COMMIT A FELONY[.]"
Good points all, Cher — though some might argue that "flicking that tongue as deamons do" should be grounds for at least a time-out.
