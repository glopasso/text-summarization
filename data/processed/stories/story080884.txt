Jacob Williamson captured our h-e-a-r-t-s at the Scripps National Spelling Bee finals this week in Maryland.
The 15-year-old was confident, enthusiastic and wore his emotions on his sleeve -- the perfect ingredients for a viral video.
"I know it! I know it! I totally know it!" he said when he was given the word "kabaragoya" (a large lizard native to Asia).
His excitement made viewers smile -- and then cringe when he misspelled the word with a C instead of a K.
His reaction to learning his mistake was a stunned, "What!?"
The video of his final mistake has made Williamson an Internet sensation. One website even set his ordeal to rap music.
