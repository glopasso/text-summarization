U.S. Army Sgt. Timothy Owens will be remembered as many things.
A son, a husband, a father.
A victim of Wednesday's shooting at Fort Hood, Owens loved the Army and planned to make it his career.
"He didn't answer the phone so I left a message on his phone. 'Son, call me so I know if you're OK or not.' Well, never got no call from him. I thought: 'Oh God, please don't let it be,'" his mother, Mary Muntean, told CNN Springfield, Illinois, affiliate WICS on Thursday.
"Very terrible that they had to shoot my son. He was a good person. Why would they shoot a good person that was helping them?"
Owens is survived by his mother, his wife and two children, according to a family statement.
One of his children mourned his passing on Facebook.
"Today at fort hood there was a shooting...my father sadly died tonight .... I still feel like it's all a dream.... Can't feel anything," wrote Loredana Owens.
"I just want everyone to think for a moment .... If you have family your fighting with forgive them, love them, because you never know when there gonna be taken from you ..... I love dad and I hate that you were taken away from me .... I love you daddy"
Owens was one of three people killed when a gunman opened fire at the sprawling Texas Army post.
The shooting suspect, 34-year-old Spc. Ivan Lopez, also died, of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.
Sixteen other people were injured.
Owens was described by his family as outgoing. He enjoyed taekwondo.
His uncle said his nephew was an honorable man, someone who never met a stranger.
"You see it happening, but you never know that it's going to come to you. It's just very disturbing," Wallace Gerhardt told WICS.
"You'd think that they'd have more security and be able to more ready for something like that to happen. I just don't understand."
