In a few months, temperatures in the Alaskan interior near the town of Fairbanks will rise into the 70s and 80s Fahrenheit (mid- to high-20s Celsius).
Hundreds of thousands of visitors will arrive to take in the epic wildlife and scenic grandeur of Denali National Park and Preserve, six million acres of unspoiled wilderness bisected by a single road.
Though in winter the area remains encased in snow, ice and freezing temperatures, the land is no less glorious for it.
Alaska photographer Pat Costello has spent the waning days of the harsh Alaska winter exploring in and around Fairbanks, the heart of the 49th state.
The most remote highway in United States, the tallest mountain in North America (Mount McKinley at 20,237 feet/6,168 meters) and the dreamlike northern lights were all on his itinerary.
A selection of his work is featured in the gallery above.
Pat Costello's Alaska photographs have earned him a worldwide following. You can find his work on his Facebook and Instagram pages.
