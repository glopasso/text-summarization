(CNN)After weeks of controversy and the sudden departures of two co-hosts, "Fashion Police" is going on an extended break.
The fashion commentary show on E! channel announced Tuesday that it will be on hiatus until September.
"We look forward to taking this opportunity to refresh the show before the next awards season," it said in a statement.
The announcement caps a rocky few months.
Last week, co-host Kathy Griffin bid the show bye-bye after seven episodes, saying her style did not blend in with her co-hosts. She made a dig at the show on her way out.
"There is plenty to make fun of in pop culture without bringing people's bodies into it," she said in a statement. "I do not want to use my comedy to contribute to a culture of unattainable perfectionism and intolerance towards difference."
Shortly before her departure, co-host Giuliana Rancic faced backlash last month for suggesting that Disney star Zendaya Coleman's dreadlocks smelled of marijuana.
Rancic later issued an on-air apology to the 18-year-old after social media jumped to the teen's defense.
But her apology was not enough for co-host Kelly Osbourne, who criticized her remarks and quit a few days later.
Rancic and fellow co-host Brad Goreski  will return in September, along with executive producer Melissa Rivers.
