Rapper Fat Joe and others in his entourage were briefly detained and questioned early Monday after a woman reported an alleged sexual assault, Madison, Wisconsin, police said.
The 33-year-old Madison woman called police with a complaint of "inappropriate touching" after Fat Joe -- whose real name is Joseph Cartagena -- performed at the city's Orpheum Theater Sunday night, a police report said.
Cartagena's lawyer said the woman was a "pretender groupie" who was attempting to "shake down" the rapper for money.
Shortly after the concert ended, the woman "found herself inside of a Cadillac Limousine with Joseph Cartagena and other male subjects all with the destination of a hotel located on Madison's west side," the police report said.
The address listed by police is on the University of Wisconsin campus, a half mile from the theater.
"There were allegations of inappropriate touching involving the female, and after some time had elapsed, the female reported this matter to Madison Police," the report said.
Cartagena and the others in his entourage were released after they were questioned, but the investigation continued, police said.
Attorney Dawn Florio issued a statement Tuesday about what she said were "false allegations made by a woman who initially posed as a fan and later claimed to be the victim of an assault after demanding money."
"At no point did Mr. Cartagena or any member of his entourage assault or have any improper contact with the woman," Florio said. "It is truly unfortunate that false allegations such as these cause the public to doubt the claims of actual victims of sexual assaults."
