(EW.com) -- Who will win the adorkable face off?
Olivia Munn is joining Zooey Deschanel's "New Girl" for an arc this season.
She's going to play "Angie," a love interest for Nick (Jake Johnson). She's described as sexy (duh), as well as "earthy, charming and can hold her own with the group."
Seinfeld and 'Kramer' get some coffee
Deadline says Munn will shoot her "New Girl" arc before re-joining HBO's "The Newsroom" for season two.
"New Girl" returned Tuesday night to 5.2 million viewers, down a bit from last year, but managed to tie NBC's "Go On."
