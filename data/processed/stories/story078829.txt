(CNN)A documentary on the life of late singer Amy Winehouse will be released in Britain on July 3, just weeks before the fourth anniversary of her death, the film's production company says.
"Amy" seeks to "truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn't get a chance to know," the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013.
It will feature "extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks," Deadline reported Wednesday.
No U.S. release date has been set, Deadline reported.
Despite releasing just two albums before her death of alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on July 23, 2011, the British singer's smoky voice and songwriting won widespread acclaim and six Grammy Awards.
"Amy" follows a poorly received biopic, "Fallen Star," released in 2013. The film was not authorized by the family and, unlike "Amy," featured none of the star's music. Winehouse's father, Mitch Winehouse, called that film "rubbish."
The team behind the new film includes Asif Kapadia, who directed the documentary "Senna," on the life of Brazilian Formula 1 racer Ayrton Senna. The film won two BAFTA awards.
The Winehouse family said in a 2013 statement that it was behind Kapadia's take on the singer's life.
"The award-winning producers of Senna presented a vision that would look at Amy's story sensitively, honestly and without sensationalising her," the family statement said. "We want this to be a tribute to her musical legacy."
