The 'Jewel of Muscat' Omanis' relationship with the sea goes back generations and sailors have traveled and traded on the water for centuries. Inside the Middle East watches the launch of the "Jewel of Muscat," a reconstruction of a 9th century spice ship. The sewn-plank ship has been faithfully reconstructed from handmade coconut fiber ropes and wood -- and without a single nail. The "Jewel of Muscat" will follow old trading routes stopping in India, Sri Lanka and Malaysia before arriving in Singapore in July. Inside the Middle East goes on deck with the captain ahead of the ship's historic launch.
Your IME diary  We bring you highlights from the Tour of Oman where cyclists rode for six days on a 700 km route in a race that is the first of this kind in Oman. At a Muscat art gallery we meet contemporary artist Hassan Meer and he describes his abstract paintings and photography. We also explore the exotic scents at the House of Amouage where CEO David Crickmore gives us a tour of the luxury perfumery.

My Beirut with Zuhair Mourad  Drawing inspiration from the blue of the Mediterranean and the green of Lebanon's valleys and mountains, fashion designer Zuhair Mourad has made his name internationally in couture.
