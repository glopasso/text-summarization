A transient, who was nicknamed "The Box Cutter," was sentenced to more than 400 years in prison for a knifing rampage against several California women.
Charles Juan Proctor was convicted this month of 22 charges including robbery and attempted murder in connection with the slashing spree, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said.
On Monday, Long Beach Superior Court Court Judge Gary Ferrari sentenced the 45-year-old man to 433 years plus 11 life sentences.
Proctor was also ordered to pay about $58,000 in restitution to two women he knifed in the throat, prosecutors said.
In all, there were six women who were attacked, prosecutors said.
Most of Proctor's victims were shop owners attacked at their places of business, authorities said. The remaining victims were shop employees.
"One of the most brutal of the attacks was the slashing of a woman who sustained a four-inch wound to the neck, plus stab wounds to her face and head," the district attorney's office said.
The man was dubbed 'the box cutter" by police during the 2008 terror spree, CNN-affiliate KTLA reported.
Prosecutors said all the women were held at the point of a knife or box-cutter during the robberies, the affiliate reported.
"You are a violent and dangerous human being. Your conduct toward these victims is absolutely despicable," the judge told Proctor during the sentencing, according to the affiliate.
"It's unconscionable what you did to these women. You shouldn't be on any street in the city of Long Beach. In fact, you shouldn't be on any street in this country."
