Dr. Bassem Youssef, dubbed the "Jon Stewart" of Egypt, will return to the late night airwaves Friday, three months after his show "Albernameg" was kicked off the air in his home country. Youssef made the announcement via his Twitter account and a YouTube video.
The new program, originating in Cairo and airing on MBC at 10 p.m. Fridays, will retain the name of his old program, which was dropped by CBC after Youssef's satire offended supporters of Egyptian Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi.
When CBC terminated "Albernameg," it raised questions about freedom of speech in Egypt under El-Sisi, the country's de facto leader since the ousting of President Mohammed Morsy on July 3.
Ironically, Youssef came to prominence with his show's satiric look at politics following the 2011 Arab Spring, and he thrived while Morsy was in charge.
Morsy and 14 other defendants are on trial, facing charges of inciting murder at the Presidential Palace in December 2012. In court on Saturday, Morsy's lawyer said he is still technically the president since he didn't resign, he was never officially overthrown and the decision to remove him wasn't published in the official Gazette. Morsy's attorney said constitutional law regulates how the President should be treated in court. The case was adjourned until Tuesday.
