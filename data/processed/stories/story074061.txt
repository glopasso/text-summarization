MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Buses that carry women only are experiencing a smooth ride with passengers in Mexico's capital.
A woman rides on a bus exclusively for female passengers last month in Mexico City.
Fans of the new service call their daily commutes more pleasant now that bus rides steer clear of too-close-for-comfort contact with men.
"We're not just talking about sexual harassment, about rapes or about incidents of violence," said Ariadna Montiel, director of the Network of Passengers' Transportation for the Government of the Federal District.
"But also about touching, staring, which is what generally occurs on public transport."
The single-sex service, which started in January, is available on four major lines in the city, and it's expected to expand to another 15. Other plans include replacing male drivers with women.
One woman described the service as "excellent," saying it's "more comfortable too because it doesn't make as many stops."
Another passenger said she feels more comfortable and safer.
Last year, the government received seven complaints of sexual abuse aboard the city's buses, which provide 200 million rides each year, officials said.  Authorities said that a single complaint is enough to justify taking such measures.
Juan Flores, who has driven buses in Mexico City for 15 years and now steers one for women only, said he even notices a difference.
"I feel more tranquil, I work more peacefully and the interior of the bus is cleaner," he said. E-mail to a friend
