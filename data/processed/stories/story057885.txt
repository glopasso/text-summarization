Planes were flying again at 4:40 p.m. (10:40 am ET).
"It's a huge snowstorm. You don't see this in Madrid often," an airport spokeswoman said.
The airport has 1,205 daily inbound and outbound flights. But for the first time, the airport halted operations due to a weather problem, the spokeswoman said.
The temporary shutdown began about noon (6 a.m. ET). Visibility was low, and the storm was so intense that the airport's snow clearing and de-icing equipment couldn't keep up, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified.
The first plane to depart when the airport reopened was a Finnair flight bound for Helsinki, a second spokeswoman said.
The delays from the storm affected hundreds of travelers at the airport. Many others could not even reach the airport because of poor road conditions.
