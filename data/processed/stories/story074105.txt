Tropical Storm Muifa killed at least 10 people and damaged an estimated 2,400 acres of of farmland when it made landfall in North Korea, state-run news agency KCNA reported Tuesday.
The agency estimated more than 100 homes were damaged in the South Hwanghae province, in the country's southwest. Power poles collapsed throughout the province, causing blackouts in some areas, the agency said.
In neighboring China, officials estimated the storm caused about 3 billion yuan ($466 million) in damage, the state news agency Xinhua said. The Chinese flood control and drought relief headquarters estimated the torrential rains affected the 1.74 million local residents living in Shanghai and surrounding provinces, Xinhua said.
Muifa made landfall in North Korea as a typhoon on Monday, bringing heavy rainfall and gusty winds, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The storm, which was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall, came ashore about 7 p.m. Monday (6 a.m. Monday ET).
Four people died and two others were reported missing in Seoul, South Korea, where the storm passed Monday evening, the semi-official Yonhap news agency reported.
At least 490,000 people were evacuated from Shandong and Liaoning provinces in eastern China, Xinhua reported. No deaths or injuries were reported.
In the city of Dalian, in Liaoning, authorities were able to avert the spill of toxic chemicals from an industrial plant after 65-foot (20-meter) waves broke through a dike protecting the area and threatened to flood the plant, according to Xinhua. Workers dumped concrete and rocks to fill in the hole.
The plant contains carcinogenic chemicals used to make polyester film and fabrics, Xinhua said.
