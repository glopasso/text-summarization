Rescuers have recovered 90 bodies so far after landslides trapped dozens of people last week in a western Indian village.
At least eight people were pulled out alive after the landslides hit Wednesday following heavy monsoon rains.
"There are almost no chances of finding survivors now unless some miracle happens," said Suresh Jadhav, a deputy district chief in Maharashtra state. He said up to 65 people remain missing.
The landslides were reported around midnight Wednesday in Malin, a village in Maharashtra's Pune district, near Mumbai.
Emergency crews are expected to clear the debris and pull out any remaining survivors or bodies, he said.
