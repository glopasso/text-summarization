A 20-year-old Saudi national was arrested in Lubbock, Texas, on Thursday for allegedly researching and acquiring materials to make explosives, law enforcement sources told CNN.
Khalid Ali-M Aldawsari planned to target the home of former President George W. Bush and other sites, the sources said.
He faces a federal charge of attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, the justice department said.
