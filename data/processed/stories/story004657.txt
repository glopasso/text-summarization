(CNN)  -- Barcelona are desperate to call on the services of Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Tuesday's vital Champions League group showdown with Inter Milan in the Camp Nou.
Barcelona must avoid defeat which could see them make a sensational exit if Russian surprise package Rubin Kazan beat Dynamo Kiev in the other match in Group F.
The defending champions have been sweating on leading scorers Messi and Ibrahimovic, who both have thigh injuries.
"Messi has an injury in the abductor muscle of his left thigh," read a club statement.
"We do not discard his presence in Tuesday's game.
"As for Ibrahimovic, there has been an improvement with regards to his thigh injury but we will have to monitor the situation."
Barcelona have been in indifferent recent form and a 1-1 draw at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday saw them drop behind arch-rivals Real Madrid at the top of the Spanish La Liga.
Barca will certainly want the key pair to be fit for next Sunday's El Clasico against Real, but first comes a European test against Jose Mourinho's Italian league-leaders.
"We know what we have to do," said Barca captain Carles Puyol. "We have the same ambitions but we know Barca v Inter is a final and we will face the game as such.
"I don't like the word failure but not to qualify for the next round would be a huge blow," he added.
"This game will be a test of character for my players," Mourinho told reporters after his side's 3-1 win over Bologna on Saturday.
They will also welcome back Wesley Sneijder, who has recovered from an ankle injury and will field Samuel Eto'o in attack as he returns to the Camp Nou for the first time since his close season transfer switch between the European powerhouses.
