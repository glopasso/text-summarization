This is the time of the year when NBA executives may get a little religious, praying that the ping pong balls in Wednesday's NBA draft lottery fall in their favor.
Nobody may be praying harder than Michael Jordan, whose Charlotte Bobcats is the losingest team in NBA history.
The Bobcats ended the season with a record of 7-59 and finished with an all-time worst .106 winning percentage.
For the lottery, the league assigns ping pong balls to the worst performing teams. The poorer a team performed in the season, the more balls it gets.
The idea is to help the team get first dibs in the draft and pick up a promising player.
The Bobcats' dismal distinction means it will have a 25% chance of getting the top pick in Wednesday's draft lottery -- and the greatest chance at picking Kentucky's all-world big man Anthony Davis.
Davis, a 6-foot-10 power forward who led Kentucky to a NCAA national championship this year, is believed to be the top prospect for any team who wins the first pick in the NBA draft.
Last year's big winner was the Cleveland Cavaliers, which won the first pick despite having the second best odds of getting it.
The draft lottery, which determines the order of the first 14 teams drafting in the June 28 draft, will be held in New York Wednesday night and will be televised.
Here are the odds of getting the first pick for the 14 teams in the draft lottery, according to the NBA:
1. Charlotte, 25%
2. Washington, 19.9%
3. Cleveland, 13.8%
4. New Orleans,13.7%
5. Sacramento, 7.6 %
6. New Jersey, 7.5%
7. Golden State, 3.6%
8. Toronto, 3.5 %
9. Detroit,1.7%
10. New Orleans,1.1%
11. Portland, 0.8%
12. Milwaukee, 0.7%
13. Phoenix, 0.6%
14. Houston, 0.5%
