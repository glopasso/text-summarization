Former porn star Jenna Jameson said she wants to get back with Tito Ortiz four days after things got "tragically out of hand" and he was arrested on a domestic violence charge.
But the couple's reconciliation "is irrelevant" to the prosecution of Ortiz since it is the state of California, not Jameson, who filed the charge against the mixed martial artist, a police spokesman said.
A restraining order prevents Ortiz and Jameson from reuniting immediately.
Ortiz, 35, was arrested at his Huntington Beach, California, home Monday morning when Jameson's father called police as the couple argued.
"By calling the police, my father was trying to defuse a private issue between two people," Jameson said in a written statement Friday.
Ortiz and his lawyer told reporters later Monday that he was upset because he thought Jameson had relapsed in her rehabilitation from a prescription drug addiction.
Jameson, 36, was captured by cameras alternately saying Ortiz was "the sweetest, most amazing man" and later saying that he had beaten her.
"Unfortunately, what actually happened has now been dramatically distorted and misinterpreted and remarks that both Tito and I made after the police arrived reflect the state of shock that we were both in," Jameson said Friday.
Now, she says she wants him back in her life.
"He's a fantastic father and I'm confident we can work through this challenge," she said.
While Ortiz and his lawyer did not immediately respond to calls for comment, the former Ultimate Fighting champ made it clear Monday night that he wanted her back.
Tears rolled down his cheeks as Ortiz listened to his lawyer talk to reporters.
"They have two children together," attorney Chip Matthews said. "They have planned on spending their lives together and they want nothing more than to work together."
