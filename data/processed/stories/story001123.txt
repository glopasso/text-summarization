The British government asked the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee to redact small parts of the panel's report that criticized the CIA's harsh interrogation program, a representative for Prime Minister David Cameron said Friday.
The comment came in response to a question from CNN about whether the UK government had seen the report on the CIA's enhanced interrogation program before it was released to the public this week, and whether London had asked for redactions or changes.
"The U.S. gave our agencies limited sight of some sections of the executive summary before its publication," Cameron's representative said about the report on the CIA program, which critics call torture. "Our agencies highlighted a small number of issues in the proposed text where changes would be necessary to protect UK national security and intelligence operations.
"None of these redactions related to allegations of UK involvement in detainee mistreatment."

Information on what was altered or obscured in the 499-page executive summary at the UK government's request wasn't immediately available.
CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.
