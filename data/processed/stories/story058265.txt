Pakistani army chief Gen. Ashfaq Pervez Kayani complained to U.S. Gen. John Allen about Taliban incursions from Afghanistan into Pakistan when he met the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, a Pakistani army source said Wednesday.
Kayani urged NATO to stop militants from crossing the border, according to the source, who was not authorized to speak to the media.
Such action would help strengthen relations between the Pakistani armed forces and NATO, the source said Kayani told the American general.
Relations between Pakistan and the United States are tense, with Pakistanis especially frustrated by what they say are U.S. drone attacks on suspected militants in their country.
NATO's International Security Assistance Force did not immediately comment on the reported meeting.
The source said Allen had told Kayani that it was necessary for the two sides to cooperate since both were fighting terrorists.
Allen said he would discuss the issue with authorities in Afghanistan, the Pakistani source said.
