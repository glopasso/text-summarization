Nine people were shot in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn early Sunday morning at a house party, police said.
Four men and five women -- all younger than 45 -- sustained injuries and were transported to four hospitals. Seven patients were released; two remain in the hospital and are in stable condition. The injuries were not life-threatening, according to New York police officer Sophia Tassy-Mason.
Police said the shooting at East 52nd Street began around 1 a.m. A neighbor, who lives nearby, told CNN affiliate WCBS that she heard a series of gunshots.
The neighborhood is a mix of residential and commercial buildings, Tassy-Mason said. According to NYPD statistics, there have been 21 shooting incidents reported in the area this year.
The number of shooters involved is still unknown, and police are searching for one or more suspects, Tassy-Mason said.
