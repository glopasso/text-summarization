The Giants proved they can win in many ways Thursday beating Detroit 2-0 after only getting five hits.
The win gives the Giants a two games to none World Series lead and comes a day after the Giants pummeled the Tigers hitting three home runs in an 8-3 victory.
"We play a lot of close games, and these guys are used to it," said Giants coach Bruce Bochy. "It's the best of seven, we're up 2. It's great to get off to a good start."
Three San Francisco pitchers combined to throw a two-hit shutout.
Madison Bumgarner went seven innings, and Santiago Casilla and Sergio Romo each pitched a hitless inning as the National League champions scratched their way to the win.
The Giants' Hunter Pence scored on a double-play groundout by Brandon Crawford to give the Giants a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the seventh and Pence hit a sacrifice fly in the bottom of the eighth to make it 2-0.
"It was a great collective effort tonight," Pence said. " I feel like everyone is on the same page, and we're just going out there and really playing as hard as we can for each other."
San Francisco only managed five hits but also drew four walks.
Tigers starter Doug Fister gutted out six innings after being struck by a batted ball. Gregor Blanco lined a ball off the top of Fister's head in the second inning. The Detroit pitcher was struck just above the right ear and the ball went into center field for a single.
The Tigers trainer checked on Fister and the pitcher stayed in the game.
The series heads to Detroit for Game 3 on Saturday night.
