Khaled Abdel Nasser, son of late Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser and a key figure during a 1980s Egyptian revolt, is dead, a spokesman for the Egyptian general prosecutor said Sunday. He was 62.
Nasser was battling liver disease and went into a coma two weeks before his death on September 15, said Adel Saeed, the prosecutor's spokesman.
He was accused of organizing a revolt against Egypt's peace treaty with Israel, signed in 1979, and also grabbed headlines after being tried in connection with the deaths of two Israeli diplomats in Egypt. He was eventually acquitted.
The late president's eldest son was an engineering professor at Cairo University and had lived in Yugoslavia.
Nasser was married to Dalia Fahmy, the sister of former oil minister Sameh Fahmy, who is currently facing trial for alleged corruption involving the exportation of gas to Israel.
