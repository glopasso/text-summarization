Alfonso Ribeiro didn't make us wait long before he revived "The Carlton" on "Dancing With the Stars."
On Monday night, the former "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" star dusted off his old familiar moves in week four of the competition.
The theme of the week was "Most Memorable Year," and "Dancing" saved the best for last. After watching the other nine celebrities and their pro dancing partners run through sambas, rumbas and jives, Ribeiro and pro dancer Witney Carson took the floor with a jazz routine set to Tom Jones' "It's Not Unusual" -- a.k.a. the song that Ribeiro's "Fresh Prince" character, Carlton Banks, couldn't help but dance to.
Dressed in a costume straight out of his "Fresh Prince's" character's closet -- a v-neck sweater and a bow tie -- Ribeiro looked like he was having a blast re-creating those exuberant dance steps along with Carson.
The judges were thrilled, giving the couple a perfect score.
Ribeiro acknowledged that playing Will Smith's dorkier cousin during "Fresh Prince's" six-season run in the '90s did leave him pigeonholed as an actor, but he has no grudge against the dance that's come to bear his character's name.
"I love the Carlton dance. I love how it makes people feel," he said in an interview. "I certainly don't do it a lot. But I love the fact that people have this nostalgic look at that dance. ... This was all for the fans."
Viewers haven't been as overjoyed with fashion designer Betsey Johnson's performance. She was the latest star to exit the series on Monday night.
