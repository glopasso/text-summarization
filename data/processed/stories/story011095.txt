George Clooney sees no reason to keep his upcoming nuptials hush-hush.
At a celebrity charity event in Tuscany, Italy over the weekend, the 53-year-old actor spilled a few details about his impending marriage to British human rights attorney Amal Alamuddin.
According to People magazine, Clooney was receiving a humanitarian award at the black-tie gala, and said during his acceptance speech, "I met my lovely bride-to-be here in Italy, whom I will be marrying, in a couple of weeks, in Venice, of all places."
The actor was of course accompanied at the soiree, called Celebrity Fight Night, by his 36-year-old fiancee. With Clooney's documented penchant for pranks, it'll be interesting to see whether he was telling the truth about his wedding plans -- or perhaps just playing a joke on any eager paparazzi.
Since the couple became engaged in the spring, they've been largely protective of their relationship. When a Daily Mail report claimed that Clooney and his future mother-in-law were at odds, Clooney blasted the publication with a first-person piece in USA Today, and then refused to accept the Daily Mail's subsequent apology.
