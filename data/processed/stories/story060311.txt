A contractor killed himself at a Florida home owned by singer and actor Olivia Newton-John, police said Tuesday.
Christopher Pariseleti, 41, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to a statement from the Jupiter Police Department. The cause of death was determined after an autopsy was conducted Tuesday morning, the statement said.
"This case investigation has been classified as a suicide and there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Mr.Pariseleti," the statement said.
Newton-John and her husband were not at the property when the shooting happened, according to a spokesman with Tequesta Fire and Rescue.
The singer's publicist said Newton-John and her husband "are in shock over the tragic event that occurred at their Florida home yesterday."
"At this time we are awaiting additional information from investigators but, can confirm that the couple was not in Florida at the time and, the deceased was not a family member," publicist Michael Caprio said Tuesday.
Public records indicate Newton-John's husband, John Easterling, owns the Palm Beach County home and that a sale is pending on the property.
