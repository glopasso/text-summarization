A medicine manufacturer is recalling batches of Motrin pain relievers that were distributed mostly to the United States and the Caribbean.
Johnson & Johnson said Wednesday it is pulling batches of Motrin coated caplets from stores because " testing of product samples showed that some caplets may not dissolve as quickly as intended when nearing their expiration date."
The products being recalled were distributed in the United States, Puerto Rico, Bahamas, Fiji, Belize, St. Lucia and Jamaica.
"This is not a consumer level recall, which means that consumers do not need to dispose of or return the product," according to a statement from J&J's McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division. "There is no safety concern if consumers continue taking the product in accordance with its label; however, it is possible there may be a delay in experiencing relief."
