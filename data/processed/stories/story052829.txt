British rugby league player Paul Wood has lost a testicle after a collision during the English sport's showpiece final at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium on Saturday.
Wood was playing for the Warrington Wolves against Leeds Rhinos in the Super League Grand Final.
The prop sustained the injury one minute into the second half, but managed to play the rest of the match before seeking treatment.
Despite Wood's determined effort, Warrington lost the match 26-18 to 2011 champions Leeds.
"Ruptured my right testicle, got a knee one minute into the second half, had to have it removed," tweeted the 30-year-old father of two.
Showing his sense of humor remained intact, he later tweeted: "Just coming out the hospital to go home... Seriously feel like I've left something?
"Tony Smith (Warrington coach) did say in his pre-match team talk last night 'your balls are on the line here guys!' I didn't think he meant literally."
Rugby League is similar to Rugby Union, although each team has 13 players rather than 15.
In addition to being played in Britain, the sport is also popular in Australia and New Zealand.
