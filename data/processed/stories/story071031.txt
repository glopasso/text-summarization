A 24-year-old Canadian man will probably face federal charges after allegedly rushing to the front of an American Airlines aircraft after it landed in Miami on Friday, the FBI said.
Two passengers on Flight 320 from Montego Bay, Jamaica, helped subdue the man, identified by the FBI as Ryan Snider.
No one was injured and there was no damage to the plane, the FBI said.
Terrorism is not suspected, the agency said.
American Airlines spokesman Ed Martelle said the man appeared to be disoriented.
"He did not obey crewmember instructions to sit down and then moved toward the front of the aircraft where he was subdued," he said in a statement.
Passenger Ronald Webb told CNN affiliate WSVN that the incident was disconcerting.
"We were a little bit worried because we didn't know what it was all about," he said.
Snider is expected to make an initial court appearance Tuesday in Miami, the FBI said.
"Consular officials in the United States have been informed of the detention of a Canadian citizen and have extended an offer of consular assistance. Canadian consular officials will remain in contact with local authorities and are prepared to provide consular assistance as needed," Chris Plunkett, spokesman for the Canadian Embassy in Washington, said in a statement.
