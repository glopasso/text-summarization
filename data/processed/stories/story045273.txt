Chicago police have arrested a fifth suspect in connection with a shooting that injured 13, including a 3-year-old child, earlier this month.
David Logan, 22, faces charges of unlawful use of a weapon and obstructing justice, police said Saturday. The arrest happened on Wednesday.
Bullets from an assault rifle and another gun wounded the 13. Two of the victims were 15 years old. Deonta Howard, a toddler, was the youngest hit. Luckily, all survived.
Authorities think the violence may have been gang-related.
Before Logan's arrest, four others had been arrested in connection with the shooting.
Police said two of the suspects -- Tabari Young, 22, and Bryon Champ, 21 -- fired shots onto a full basketball court. Champ is a documented gang member, according to authorities.
Those four have been charged with attempted murder and aggravated battery with a firearm, police said.
Young is accused of firing the assault-style rifle. Police say Champ also fired a gun of some kind.
A third suspect, Kewane Gatewood, 20, is accused of supplying the assault weapon, and Brad Jett, 22, was allegedly the lookout during the shooting, police said.
