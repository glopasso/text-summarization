A strong earthquake struck coastal Chile near the port city of Valparaiso late Monday, causing mudslides and some minor damage, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
The 6.7-magnitude quake knocked out some power and phone lines in the region, authorities said.
The temblor was felt in the capital city, Santiago, located 69 miles from the epicenter. A CNN en EspaÃ±ol anchor held onto his desk as the quake rattled the studio during a newscast in Huechurba, a suburb of the capital.
"We could feel the ground shaking," said journalist Richard Madan. "It felt like we were standing on a subway track but multiply that by about 200."
Madan, of CNN's Canadian affiliate CTV, is in Santiago as part of the traveling press for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's visit there.
Both he and the Canadian delegation were okay, Madan said.
No tsunami warning was issued, according to Chile's Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service, and a preventive evacuation for the area has been lifted. A 72-year-old man died of a heart attack during the evacuation, according to regional Mayor Raul Celis.
The same part of the country was hit with an 8.8-magnitude earthquake in February 2010, killing hundreds of people.
Chile is on the so-called "Ring of Fire," an arc of volcanoes and fault lines circling the Pacific Basic that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
CNN en EspaÃ±ol's Jose Manuel Rodriguez contributed to this report.
