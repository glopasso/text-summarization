The son of an Iranian woman facing imprisonment and possible execution by stoning has been told that Iranian authorities will contact him about his mother's case Thursday, a human rights activist said Sunday.
Mina Ahadi, chairwoman of the International Committee Against Stoning and Execution, said authorities contacted the son of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani on Sunday. They did not specify the nature of the information he would receive on Thursday.
Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani was convicted of adultery in 2006, and was originally sentenced to death by stoning.
Iranian authorities say the sentence has been put on hold, but there have been no reports as to whether a new sentence has been imposed.
The 43-year-old mother of two is reportedly still being held held in Tabriz prison.
Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by another means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups.
Ashtiani's attorney, Mohammad Mostafaei, told CNN earlier this month that his client confessed to the crime after being subjected to 99 lashes. He said she later recanted the confession and denied any wrongdoing.
Mostafaei has gone into hiding since last weekend after being interrogated by Iranian authorities, human rights groups say.
Advocates and Mostafaei say his wife and brother-in-law are being held by Iranian authorities.
A letter believed to be written by Mostafaei was posted on the Internet on Saturday, calling for the release of his relatives. The lawyer says he has cooperated with interrogators, and says his wife and brother-in-law are victims of of "hostage taking." Mostafaei said he and his family are innocent of any wrongdoing.
