A porn actor, who was accused of killing a coworker with a sword, died after falling off a cliff Saturday when police used a stun gun to subdue him.
Police said Stephen Clancy Hill attacked three coworkers with a samurai-style sword at the scene of a pornographic film shoot on Tuesday. One of the men later died.
When police caught up with Hill on Saturday, he kept them at bay for eight hours atop a cliff in West Hills, said Officer Bruce Borihanh.
To take Hill into custody, officers used their stun guns on him - at which point he fell, Borihanh said.
Police said Hill jumped, but also added it was unclear what caused his death.
On Tuesday night, West Valley police were called to a home on Hayvenhurst Avenue following reports of an assault with a deadly weapon.
The home was being used to make pornographic films, but shoots had ended for the day.
Authorities said Hill was at the house, socializing with some coworkers. Then, without provocation, Hill grabbed a sword -- typically used as a prop -- and attacked one of the men, police said.
When two men tried to intervene, Hill attacked them too, police said.
He then left the scene, and eluded police -- until they spotted him Saturday.
