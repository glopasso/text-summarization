(EW.com) -- Anyone wanting to get a glimpse of the abhorrent behavior in the "Big Brother" house this week needs to seek out fansites.
Wednesday's telecast made no mention of the racist and homophobic behavior that was uttered by several house guests on the 24/7 Internet feed.

Though word of the loathsome behavior has spread like wild fire â€” two organizations that employ houseguests GinaMarie Zimmerman and Aaryn Gries have already announced they were terminating the young women for their comments â€” the show decided on Wednesday to steer clear of the subject.
The next episode of Big Brother airs on Sunday.
