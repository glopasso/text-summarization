The powerful storm system behind the twister that ravaged Moore, Oklahoma, set its sights on the Great Lakes and Tennessee Valley on Wednesday, forecasters said.
"Primary threats will be damaging winds and large hail," according to the National Weather Service. "Isolated tornadoes will also be possible."
Severe weather watches continued into the early hours of the day for portions of Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi.
