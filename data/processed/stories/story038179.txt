The last remaining places for European football's showpiece tournament will be decided on Tuesday when eight nations compete in the second leg of the Euro 2012 playoffs.
Ten countries have already qualified, along with co-hosts Poland and Ukraine, for the four-yearly tournament taking place in June and July.
The most evenly-poised tie is in Lisbon, where 2004 hosts Portugal take on Bosnia-Herzegovina following Friday's 0-0 draw in Zenica.
Turkey reached the semifinals in 2008, but face an uphill struggle to appear at the 14th staging of the event after Croatia won 3-0 in the first leg in Istanbul.
Montenegro, competing for the first time as an independent nation, will also have to overhaul a deficit at home after losing 2-0 in Prague to the Czech Republic -- who finished runners-up on debut in 1996 after the split with Slovakia.
Estonia caused a surprise by reaching the playoffs after taking second place in Group C behind Italy, meaning 2010 World Cup qualifiers Serbia and Slovenia missed out.
However, the East Europeans are unlikely to be included in the December 2 group-stage draw after losing 4-0 in Tallinn to the Republic of Ireland on Friday. The Irish have qualified for the finals only once, in 1988.
Next year will be the last time the tournament is played by 16 teams ahead of an expansion to 24.
World champions Spain will defend their European title, having qualified as group winners along with Germany, Russia, France, the Netherlands, Greece, England and Denmark.
Sweden went through as the second-placed team with the best record.
