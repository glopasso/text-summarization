At least five people were reported killed and 30 injured Monday evening when a freak dust storm rolled through Iran's capital, Tehran.
The storm brought winds that nearly reached 120 kilometers per hour, or some 75 mph, according to Iran's Press TV.
It reported the storm plunged the city into darkness, and photographs from Tehran showed giant clouds of sand and dust clogging the air.
Some flights were delayed at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport, but operations returned to normal when the storm passed, Press TV said.
It was not immediately clear how the victims were killed or injured.
