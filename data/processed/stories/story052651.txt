Alex Trebek suffered a mild heart attack Saturday, but the "Jeopardy!" host should make a full recovery and return to the game show next month, a Sony Television spokeswoman said Sunday.
Trebek, 71, checked into Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Saturday and remained there Sunday, Sony's Paula Askanas said.
"Trebek is in good spirits and is currently under observation and undergoing further testing," Askanas said. " He is expected to fully recover and be back at 'Jeopardy!' when production begins taping in July for the new season, the show's 29th."
The show won the best game show Emmy at the Daytime Emmy awards Saturday.
