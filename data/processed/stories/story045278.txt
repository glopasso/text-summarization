A federal airport screener has been charged with sexual assault after he allegedly assaulted a woman near his home in Manassas, Virginia, police said Tuesday.
Police said Harold Glenn Rodman, 52, was wearing a uniform and displayed a badge at the time of the attack.
Rodman is a Transportation Security Administration officer at Dulles International Airport, the TSA confirmed. He has been removed from security operations pending the investigation.
According to Prince William County, Virginia, police, a 37-year-old woman and her friend were walking in a Manassas neighborhood when a man who was unknown to them approached, displayed a badge and then sexually assaulted the woman before fleeing on foot. Police responded to a call at 3:25 a.m. Sunday and, while canvassing the neighborhood, noticed a man matching the attacker's description exit his home, police said. The man was arrested in connection with the incident, police said.
Rodman is charged with abduction with intent to defile, aggravated sexual assault, forcible sodomy and object sexual penetration.
A TSA spokesman said the TSA is working closely with police on the case.
"TSA holds its personnel to the highest professional and ethical standards, and investigates all allegations of misconduct," TSA spokesman Greg Soule said. "The disturbing allegations against this individual in no way reflect the work of the more than 50,000 security officers who every day ensure the security of the traveling public."
