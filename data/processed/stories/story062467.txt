First impressions can be wrong.
This painting of Jane Austen, the author behind famous novels "Pride and Prejudice" and "Sense and Sensibility," has sold at auction for £164,500 ($270,000).
It's the same image which is set to grace £10 notes across Britain, from 2017.
The painting was commissioned by the Victorian novelist's nephew in 1869, and was sold by auction house Sotheby's to an anonymous private collector.
