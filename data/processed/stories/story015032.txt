Seven-time champion Michael Schumacher will reach the 300-race milestone when he competes in this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix at Spa Francorchamps.
The 43-year-old German is the second driver in F1 history, after Brazil's Rubens Barrichello, to achieve the feat and will be hoping for an upturn in his fortunes in his Mercedes.
A superb podium finish at the European Grand Prix has been mixed with retirements in six of 10 races this season and Schumacher is confident he can turn it around on his favorite circuit.
"Spa is like my living room; for me, it's clearly the number one race track in the world," Schumacher told the official F1 website.
"It's uncanny how I always seem to have special moments there -- my debut, my first win, a world championship victory and many great races.
"We delivered a good performance in Spa last year; I'll be doing everything possible to drive a strong race," he added.
Schumacher's first appearance in F1 came at Spa in 1991 for Jordan before he moved to Benetton to win successive titles in 1994 and 1995.
He switched to Ferrari the next year and won five further titles with the famous marque before retiring in 2006.
His return in 2010 with Mercedes has not seen him add to his 91 GP wins, but he remains determined to carry on competing.
"I'm proud to be just the second driver in the history of the sport to reach this milestone," he said.
Barrichello made 326 Grand Prix appearances before retiring at the end of 2011.
The Belgian Grand Prix sees the main contenders for the title lock horns again after the mid season break with Ferrari's Fernando Alonso leading the way with nine races remaining.
