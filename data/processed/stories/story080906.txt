(CNN)  -- Fifteen employees were fired for improperly accessing medical records of Nadya Suleman, the mother of octuplets, a Kaiser Permanente spokesman said Monday.
Nadya Suleman has been the subject of much curiosity since she gave birth to octuplets.
"We always provide training on the importance of patient privacy and confidentiality," said Jim Anderson, the hospital spokesman.
"We knew from the time she (Nadya Suleman) was admitted to the hospital in December, this case would attract attention.
"Numerous training sessions were held to remind people of the need to keep the information confidential."
Eight other employees of the Bellflower, California hospital were disciplined for accessing Suleman's files, Anderson said.
Anderson said there's no indication that any of the information was distributed outside the hospital to the media.
Suleman, a resident La Habra, California, and already a single mother with six young children, gave birth to the octuplets through in-vitro fertilization, fueling controversy.
News of her collecting public assistance for some of her children also outraged many taxpayers.
