Matthew McConaughey tied the knot with longtime girlfriend Camila Alves at an intimate ceremony in Texas.
The pair wed before close friends and family in Austin on Saturday evening.
They started dating in 2006, and the Brazilian model is the mother of his two children.
Last year, McConaughey, 42, said while there were no immediate plans to get married, that did not make them any less committed.
"Maybe one day ... maybe something down the line at the right time," he told CNN's Piers Morgan.
"To do that, you have to really feel it. You have to really want to move forward to those things. Right now we are wonderfully happy, healthy. I get no pressure."
McConaughey and Alves, 30, got engaged in December.
McConaughey has appeared in several movies, including "The Wedding Planner" and "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."
