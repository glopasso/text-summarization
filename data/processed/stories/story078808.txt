A suspect has been named in the October 2 beating of a blind man, the Philadelphia Police Department said Friday.
Mustafa Guyton, 29, is accused of aggravated assault after he allegedly kicked and stomped the 33-year-old man in Philadelphia's Southwest Germantown neighborhood, a police news release says.
The assault was caught by a surveillance camera, and the Philadelphia Police Department said they released the video in an effort to identify the suspect.
The victim was walking down the street around noon on October 2 when the attacker looked in his direction, police said. The grainy video shows the attacker laying down his backpack near a corner shop after he spots the victim.
The video goes black, and in the next moment, the victim is pushed to the ground and then repeatedly punched, stomped and kicked as witnesses watch.
One man is crosses the street mere steps from the beating, and continues walking.
After the attacker finishes, he picks up his backpack and walks away, leaving the victim helpless on the ground with injuries to his head and face, police said.
Officer Tanya Little, a Philadelphia police spokeswoman, said it was not clear whether the attacker knew the victim was blind. The victim told police he did not recognize his attacker's voice.
