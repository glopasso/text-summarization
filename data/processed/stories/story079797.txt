Everyone fantasizes about breaking free from life's constraints, but a curious koala at the San Diego Zoo lived the dream Tuesday.
Mundu, a 2-year-old koala, escaped from his enclosure, spending the day sleeping in a tree high above his exhibit.
Zookeepers discovered he was missing shortly after feeding and watering the koalas at about 9 a.m. PT, said Jenny Mehlow, a zoo spokeswoman.
No one knows exactly how he got out.
But Mundu is on the cusp of sexual maturity, Mehlow said. His hormones are raging and he is constantly testing limits.
Because the koala was not in any danger and did not pose any risk to the public, zookeepers took shifts watching Mundu in the tree.
When the zoo closed, they lured him back into his exhibit. Mundu was then checked by a veterinarian.
According to the San Diego Zoo website, the facility is famous for having the largest koala colony and the most successful breeding program outside of Australia.
The exhibit has a Koala Cam, but Mundu's Houdini-like move was not caught on camera.
