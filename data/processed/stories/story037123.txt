(Rolling Stone) -- At a listening party in London last night, Justin Bieber told reporters that one of the many new songs that could appear on his upcoming album, "Believe," was about Mariah Yeater, the woman who falsely accused him of fathering her child, the BBC reports.
According to the BBC, while talking about his inspiration, Bieber said he'd written "songs like that girl -- Mariah Yeater -- who said she was going to have my baby." The singer added, "I wrote about that situation."
Last November, Yeater claimed that she and Bieber had sex backstage following a show in Los Angeles, and that he was the father of her then-three month old baby boy. While the case was dropped a few weeks after, Bieber still took a paternity test that proved he was not the father.
In London, Bieber also said he'd recorded 40 songs for the record, and of the various collaborations (ranging from Taylor Swift to Drake to Kanye West) he said, "It's so cool to do different styles and step out of my comfort zone."
"Every song has a piece of me, it's hard to pick," Bieber said "I wrote almost all of them or co-wrote them."
