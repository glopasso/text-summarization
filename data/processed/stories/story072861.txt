Here's hoping Yeiner Garizabalo wears more to court Tuesday than he did in a San Francisco subway station in May.
When last we saw him, the 24-year-old appeared in a bizarre video where he, sans clothing, performed acrobatics off subway equipment, then went after commuters trying to catch a train.
Garizabalo faces seven charges following the outrageous May 10 incident at a Bay Area Rapid Transit station, a spokesman for the San Francisco District Attorney's office said Monday.
A video of the incident surfaced last week and quickly went viral.
In it, a glistening man with a wild mane of hair turns fare gates into balance beams, doing splits and back flips buck-naked. Startled commuters flee as he dashes across the station, attacking people at random.
Last week, police said Garizabalo had been arrested, given a mental evaluation, charged with battery and released.
He now stands accused of two felony counts of false imprisonment, four misdemeanor counts of battery and one misdemeanor count of sexual battery in the incident, spokesman Alex Bastian said.
California defines false imprisonment as "the unlawful violation of the personal liberty of another."
A judge set Garizabalo's bail at $100,000 after he was re-arrested Monday. He will be arraigned Tuesday afternoon, Bastian said.
Garizabalo, who is also known as Yeiner Perez, was, until recently, a member of the ClownSnotBombs Circus. The group posted a statement on its website saying he was no longer affiliated with the group.
"To our knowledge, Mr. Perez never exhibited this type of behavior previously and this episode came as a complete surprise to us," it said. "Our hearts go out to those who were impacted by this incident and Mr. Perez himself. We believe Mr. Perez has a medical issue and hope that he receives the medical help that he needs."
