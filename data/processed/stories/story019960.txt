Roma defender Leandro Castan underwent successful neurosurgery Wednesday, having previously complained of acute dizziness during an Italian Serie A match in September.
Castan reported the problem during halftime of his side's 1-0 victory against Empoli, and after facing tests earlier this month, he went under the knife to remove the cavernoma -- a cluster of abnormal blood vessels -- in his brain.
The three-and-a-half-hour procedure was "carried out using a surgical microscope and neuronavigator," according to an official Roma statement, while the player's "neurophysiological activity was constantly monitored."
The cavernoma, which measured three centimeters, was "completely removed."
The statement added: "Castan has now woken up and is breathing unaided, and has been informed of the operation's successful outcome.
"He will remain in intensive care for the next 24 hours, after which a prognosis will be formed."
While Wednesday's operation should ensure that Castan will be able to play football again, reports suggest that he will not be ready to return to action for up to eight months.
The 28-year-old, who arrived at Roma from Corinthians in 2012, has made just one appearance for the Italian Serie A club this season, having been sidelined since being substituted at halftime against Empoli.
Castan has become a key player for Roma since joining, making 36 appearances last term as the club booked their place in Europe's Champions League.
