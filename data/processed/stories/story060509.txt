A soldier apparently shot herself on Monday at a military post in central Virginia and later died, the Army said.
The incident began at about 8:45 a.m. ET at Fort Lee when the soldier apparently brandished a weapon and then barricaded herself in an office at the Army Combined Arms Support Command headquarters building, according to a statement from the post.
The statement said that Fort Lee Police responded within two minutes and quickly established contact with her.
But during "the course of negotiations," she "reportedly turned the weapon on herself" and fired one shot, the statement said.
The soldier, who was not identified, later died at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, the statement added.
The post was temporarily locked down in response to the incident that is under investigation.
Fort Lee is located near Petersburg, about 30 miles south of Richmond.
Retired Maj. Gen. James "Spider" Marks, a CNN military analyst, described Fort Lee as a "very active" one, with soldiers "routinely coming and going to get various types of training."
