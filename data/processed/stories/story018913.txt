An apparently agitated passenger attacked a flight attendant on Alitalia Flight 329 from Paris to Rome late Sunday and asked that the flight be diverted to Tripoli, Libya, the airline said.
Other flight attendants immobilized the attacker, Alitalia said, and the plane and its 131 passengers landed safely at Rome's Fiumicino airport, where the attacker was taken into police custody.
The flight attendant was taken to the airport emergency room for a check-up, the airline said.
Italy's state-run ANSA news agency reported the attacker was a man from Kazakhstan and that he attacked the flight attendant with nail clippers.
