A Michael Jackson tribute belt blocked from sale three years ago by the singer's estate is now cleared for sale after an out-of-court settlement.
The belt dispute was one of several between Michael Jackson's estate and members of his family that erupted in the year after the pop icon's death. The agreement suggests that nearly four years after his death there is a calmer relationship between them.

The trustees of Jackson's estate issued a cease and desist letter when the crystal-encrusted belts initially went on sale in May 2010, saying they had not approved a contract between Katherine Jackson and the marketers.
Michael Jackson's mother is no longer involved as a partner with B.B. Simon, the California company that makes the belts, under the deal reached with the estate clearing way for the sales, according to the company.
The spokesman for the estate declined to comment on the belt agreement.

Jackson's mother and her grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson are the chief beneficiaries of the Michael Jackson estate. Charities yet to be chosen will also get 20% of the estate's profits, according to the will signed by Jackson.
A limited run of 7,000 leather belts, designed by Simon Tavassoli, are handmade at his Newport Beach, California, studio. They went on sale again this week through the designer's website for $1,600.
