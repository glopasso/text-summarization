Halle Berry married French actor Olivier Martinez in a private ceremony in France on Saturday, her representative confirmed Sunday.
It's the third marriage for the Oscar-winning actress, who announced in April that she is expecting a baby with Martinez.
Berry, 46, and Martinez, 47, have been close companions since meeting on the set of "Dark Tide" last year.
He was by her side through the last months of her bitter custody battle with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry, the Canadian model who fathered her 5-year-old daughter Nahla.
They reached "an amicable agreement" over custody last November, a week after a fistfight in Berry's Hollywood driveway between Martinez and Aubry.
Berry was previously married to former pro baseball player David Justice -- from 1993 until 1996 -- and singer Eric Benet -- from 2001 to 2004.
"I feel fantastic," Berry told CNN when discussing her pregnancy in April. "This has been the biggest surprise of my life, to tell you the truth. I thought I was kind of past the point where this could be a reality for me. So it's been a big surprise and the most wonderful."
