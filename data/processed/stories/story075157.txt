A security guard was arrested this week and is accused of stealing two Los Angeles Lakers championship rings and $20,000 in gift cards, police said.
Eddie Monterroso, 23, who worked at a Lakers training facility, was arrested Tuesday outside the facility, the El Segundo Police Department said.
The two championship rings were from the 2009 and 2010 seasons, police said.
A search of the suspect's home on December 10 "yielded evidence of the theft as well as the championship rings," according to an El Segundo Police Department statement.
He is facing charges of burglary and grand theft, police said.
The gift cards were going to be used by the team to give away as donations to community groups for Christmas, the Los Angeles Times reported.
The police were able to retrieve only $6,000 in the gift cards, the newspaper reported.
