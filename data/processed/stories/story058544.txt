Barcelona FC will travel to London on Tuesday evening ahead of Saturday's Champions League final because of fears Iceland's volcanic ash cloud could disrupt their travel plans later in the week.
"Due to the uncertainty caused by ash from the Grimsvotn volcano, the first team of Barcelona will travel to London on Tuesday at 10pm," read a statement on the club's web site, Tuesday.
Players and coaching staff had initially planned to travel on Thursday, 48 hours ahead of their clash against Manchester United at Wembley Stadium, but plumes of ash are already beginning to disrupt flights in Scotland and the north of England.
Last year, Barcelona were forced to travel 1,000 kilometers by coach to play the first leg of their semi-final tie with Inter Milan -- a game they lost 3-1 -- when an ash cloud from Iceland's Eyjafjallajokull volcano caused widespread flight disruption across Europe in April 2010.
