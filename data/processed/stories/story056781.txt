Three blasts rocked northeastern Myanmar leaving one person dead and two others injured, an official told CNN Thursday
According to Sai Tin Ooo, a lawmaker in Shan state -- which borders China -- the first explosion occurred late Wednesday night causing no injuries. Two other explosions on Thursday morning killed one person and wounded two others.
Local police confirmed the incidents but could provide no further details.
The blasts are the latest in a series of explosions in Myanmar. Late on Monday, a homemade explosive device went off at the luxury Traders Hotel in former capital Yangon, a popular destination for international visitors, injuring one American woman, according to police.
A 27-year-old suspect was arrested early Tuesday in the southeastern state of Mon in connection with the bombing at the Traders, Agence France-Presse reported.
He had previously stayed in the room where the blast occurred, AFP said, citing police sources.
A further suspect was being sought by authorities in connection with an explosion last Friday at a guesthouse in the town of Taunggu, about 65 kilometers (40 miles) from the capital Naypyidaw, that killed a man and a woman, AFP said.
No group has claimed responsibility for the blasts, while police have not said whether they are connected.
A number of Western governments have urged their nationals to exercise caution when traveling in Myanmar.
