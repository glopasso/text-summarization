The victim of a brutal gang rape that sparked massive protests in India's capital, arrived in Singapore for further medical treatment on Thursday.
The patient arrived at 9:05 a.m. local time, a spokesperson for the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore told CNN.
"She is in extremely critical condition and being examined by doctors," the spokesperson said.
The 23-year-old woman was severely injured and has spent days in intensive care, after what police said was a gang rape and beating on a moving bus in New Delhi on December 16.
Widespread anger over the incident prompted massive anti-rape protests in the Indian capital over the weekend.

Police prohibited demonstrations in key government districts, but these lockouts were lifted Wednesday as traffic appeared back to normal at Raisina Hills -- home to the seat of Indian power -- and police removed security barriers from most roads.
New Delhi's metro rail reopened its services around central parts of the city. Services were shut down after protests swelled Saturday and Sunday.
On Wednesday, demonstrations also thinned at alternative sites where students had gathered to protest the gang rape.
