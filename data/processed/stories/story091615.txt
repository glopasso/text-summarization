CNN senior international correspondent Nick Paton Walsh has won an Emmy and an Edward R. Murrow Award for his reports from the front line of the war in Syria.
Paton Walsh has reflected on his experiences in Aleppo, where he reported on the heart-wrenching cruelty of a conflict that has torn the country apart.
"Aleppo Airstrikes" is the account of indiscriminate shelling in the Syrian city of Aleppo. Walsh's piece to camera sees him crouching as a government bomber jet flies above. "It's that sound that terrifies ordinary residents of Aleppo daily," he says. Of the lone infant who survives the strike, Paton Walsh observes: "A year old, he was born into Syria's bloody revolution, and may yet survive it still."
In "Aleppo: Old City Fight," Paton Walsh goes right inside the fight for the historic old city. His report focuses on the improvised nature of the battle, with "pot-shots at nothing in particular" and what it could mean for the wider conflict.
Paton Walsh says of the scene in Aleppo in 2012: "People didn't really know where the front lines were. It was generally chaotic, and pretty much punctuated all day long with the sound of shelling, or jets flying in to hit civilian areas."
Paton Walsh was awarded the Emmy for outstanding writing for these stories and his report from Afghanistan on an epidemic of self-immolation among young married women in Herat.
In its submission to the Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards, CNN highlighted Paton Walsh's "poetic writing," saying it contrasted "with the sobering environments from which his stories are usually drawn."
"His reports punch through the daily accounts of wounded and dead, and give us a fresh way to see the grinding pitilessness of war, and its quirky inconsistencies."
