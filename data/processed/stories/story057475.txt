(CNN)If you (or, more likely, your kids) are still singing those "Frozen" tunes over a year later, you'll have a brand new set of tunes in the not-too-distant future.
Disney officially announced the most obvious sequel in recent years, "Frozen 2," on Thursday to stockholders, along with more major movie news.
The original creative team of Chris Buck, Jennifer Lee and Peter Del Vecho will return, and Josh Gad (Olaf himself) was on hand to make the announcement.
Cast member Kristen Bell also shared the news with her Twitter followers.
No release date yet, fans, but don't "let it go," as you should know soon.
