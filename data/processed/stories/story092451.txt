(CNN Student News) -- October 29, 2014
If you know what the southernmost U.S. state is, then you know where we're going for one of the stories on today's show. The location's slow-moving natural disaster is a study in geology and earth science. Also featured is a debate concerning quarantines and the Ebola virus. And we look inside a plane that appears to be made of giant windows, though it actually has none for passengers.
