Good luck stopping the phenomenon that is One Direction.
According to Forbes, the group has announced 2015 summer tour dates just two months after their highly successful Where We Are Tour ended.
The aptly titled On the Road Again Tour will travel across Europe and the U.S.
"The band will be playing a few of the same stadiums they did during 'Where We Are,' including Gillette Stadium, MetLife Stadium and Lincoln Financial Field," Forbes reports. "However, many of the stops on upcoming tour are new such as Santa Clara's Levi's Stadium, Seattle's CenturyLink Field and Columbus' Ohio Stadium, which has a capacity over 104,000."
This will be music to the ears of the tweens and teens who weren't able to snag tickets last time around. But it's probably not so great for the parents who may have to foot the bill, which averaged over $100 per ticket.
Last year, the group was predicted to become the first boy band worth $1 billion, thanks in part to the tour and their film "This Is Us."
With so much boy band heat, could there be a further resurgence? We're looking at you, *NSYNC.
