(CNN)English actress Michelle Keegan has been named the sexiest woman in the world by British men's magazine FHM.
The 27-year-old actress is best known for her roles on the BBC series "Ordinary Lies" and the long-running British soap opera "Coronation Street." Her "Coronation Street" character Tina McIntyre was the show's first character to act as a surrogate, according to IMDB.
Keegan is followed by reality television star and model Kendall Jenner, Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence, Sports Illustrated swimsuit cover girl Kate Upton and British television host Caroline Flack, who dated One Direction's Harry Styles for a few months.
Sandra Bullock doesn't appear anywhere on FHM's list, even though People magazine named her the "World's Most Beautiful Woman" a week ago.
The "FHM 100 Sexiest Women in the World" issue goes on sale Thursday, April 30.
