(EW.com ) -- Social media can be a complicated thing for any celebrity.
On one hand, it gives fans an opportunity to connect personally with stars. On the other, it can be a place for public attacks and ridicule, and in the case of Shia LaBeouf, a great way to express yourself through other people's words.
It seems Keira Knightley is above it all. In a new interview with Harper's Bazaar UK, the British actress revealed she once secretly joined Twitter using a fake name, only to delete the account 12 hours later. "It made me feel a little bit like being in a school playground and not being popular and standing on the sidelines kind of going, 'Argh,'" Knightley told the mag. The notoriously private star, who was married to musician James Righton in May, also addressed the perception around Hollywood of her "snooty" attitude.
"I like being private. I haven't asked a lot of the actresses who I really admire, 'How do you do it?' because I don't want to know. Maybe I'm childish in that way; I just don't want to know about your life."
