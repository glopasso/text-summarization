The old adage has it that you wait ages for one bus then two come along at once -- but Jimmy Walker isn't complaining.
Three months ago he won his first PGA title at the Frys.com Open on his eighth year on the tour, but he didn't have to wait long for his second.
After a round of 63 at Waialae Country Club in Honolulu he finished one shot ahead of the field to take the Sony Open title and secure an early birthday present ahead of turning 35 on Thursday.
A run of four birdies in the final six holes saw Walker finish on 17-under par, one shot ahead of fellow American Chris Kirk, and two clear of Harris English.
"I think Frys taught me a lot," Walker told the PGA Tour's official website. "It was stay patient, stay focused, don't get bent out of shape when you make a bogey or any of that kind of stuff.
"It took me a long time to do it and I feel like I did learn a lot that week. I felt very calm and under control, that's what you've got to do when it's time want to win.
"Today was awesome, I felt in control all day, of my emotions mentally and physically, and it was really cool golf.
"I stayed patient, I didn't make any bogeys, I made a really key par putt on 14 and then the string of birdies there was pretty awesome."
Walker was one of only two players to stay bogey-free on Sunday and after going 188 starts without a PGA Tour win, it has taken him just five more to lock down a second.
He credits the work he's done with famed coach Butch Harmon in the past year, who has also worked with Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, for transforming his game.
"When I went and saw him, he said I believe in you and I believe you've got a lot of talent, and I think you're under utilizing what you've got," Walker said.
"He's a very confident person. When he tells you something, you believe it."
