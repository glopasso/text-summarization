Filipino hero Manny Pacquiao scored a comprehensive 12-round points victory over Timothy Bradley to regain the WBO welterweight title he controversially lost to the previously unbeaten American two years ago.
At 35, many had believed that the Pacman's best years were behind him, but he was an easy winner Saturday night in Las Vegas on all three of the judges' scorecards after dominating the bout.
Pacquiao improved to 56-5 with two drawn and predicted he would continue to ply his trade in the ring for some time yet.
"I think I can go another two years," said Pacquiao. "I'm so happy to be world champion again. Tim Bradley was not an easy fight."
Bradley had won their 2012 clash on a disputed points decision and Pacquiao also lost his next fight when knocked out by Juan Manuel Marquez in the sixth round.
But he beat the promising young Brandon Rios last November to revive his fortunes and was back to his peerless best to take Bradley's perfect record.
The WBO may mandate Pacquiao to face the winner of the Marquez-Mike Alvarado clash next month although the bigger prize may be a long-awaited clash with American superstar Floyd Mayweather.
Contractual and legal wrangles have to date prevented a money-spinning bout between the two boxing icons but Pacquiao's performance in beating Bradley has certainly restored his reputation.
A star-studded crowd watched the fight in the MGM Grand Arena and aside from a spell in the fourth round, Pacquiao was in control.
Back home in the Philippines, thousands watched the fight on big screens, cheering wildly as their national hero took command.
"The people of the nation are united in cheering on the victory of the nation's fist," President Benigno Aquino's spokesman told AFP after the victory.
Many Filipino's are still recovering from the devastating impact of Super Typhoon Haiyan last year and Aquino said Pacquiao was a symbol of resistance in the face of adversity, having himself recovered from the defeats to Bradley and Marquez.
