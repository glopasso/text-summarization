If Tyra Banks is correct, one day, you will be able to get a nose job as easily as you can buy tissues to blow your nose.
The model-turned-mogul wrote an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal in which she made predictions about the future of beauty. It included her theories that "Plastic surgery will be as easy and quick as going to the drugstore for Tylenol" and "Skin color and features will mesh into a similar shade for the majority of people."
"As I look into the future, I see radical changes in both how people 'attain beauty,' and how the world perceives beauty," Banks wrote. "In general, I believe, traditional beauty will be less valuable -- and more uniqueness will be heralded."
The creator of "America's Next Top Model" also said she can see a world where climate change will cause a scarcity of natural foods, making hourglass figures the sought-after standard. The ability to select a baby's features will occur as one would choose "menu items at a fast-food drive-through window."
"Blue and green eyes will become so common that dark brown will become the rare and newly desired eye color," she said.
The piece is a part of a series in which the Journal asked celebs and leaders to theorize about the future of their respective industries. Taylor Swift also wrote about her thoughts on what will become of the music industry.
