Bravo's "Real Housewives of Atlanta" cast is supporting one of its own through a devastating loss.
On Tuesday, Sharon Tucker, the mother of cast member Todd Tucker and mother-in-law to "RHOA" star Kandi Burruss, died after suffering a stroke the day before.
Viewers of "RHOA" came to know Miss Sharon, as she was called on the series, while watching her son Todd develop a relationship with Burruss. During one unfortunate altercation, Miss Sharon was seen defending her son to Burruss' mother, Joyce.
Todd and Burruss went on to marry in April, and through it all it was clear how close Todd was with his mother.
"I lost my partner, my ride or die my best friend!" Todd posted on Instagram Tuesday. "I don't know what to do? I'm lost! My heart hurts so much! She was a fighter, a warrior for her son! It was me and her against the world! She's in a better place!! Mom I love you to death! Rest in peace!"
Burruss shared a message of her own in the wake of Sharon Tucker's death Tuesday, saying that she was still in shock.
"Sharon was the best mother in-law! She was fun, energetic, loving, & caring. I loved how she liked to get up & go all the time. She would get you in check one minute & give you a hug the next minute," Burruss wrote. "I'm so sad for (Todd) because they were so close ... He talked to her every morning & all thru out the day, every day. It's hard losing people that you love but when it's out of the blue with no warning it just makes it that much harder."
As Burruss and her husband grieve, they have the support of their "RHOA" co-stars.
"My prayers are with The Tucker family tonight! Todd your Mother Miss Sharon was a beautiful soul & so loving she will be missed," "RHOA's" Porsha Williams shared on Instagram.
"I am deeply saddened by the news of (Todd's) mother Sharon's untimely passing. I enjoyed every moment that I spent with her," wrote Cynthia Bailey. And to Todd: "May the comfort of God be with you and your family during this difficult time."
