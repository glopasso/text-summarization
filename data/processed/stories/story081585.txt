(PEOPLE.com) -- One thing Jennifer Lopez hasn't missed about not constantly being in the spotlight anymore: constantly watching her weight.
"Part of my business is being in shape and looking good. You can't lie to yourself about it," Lopez, 40, told the January issue of Allure. "But I'm not the monster I used to be in the exercise department."
Her reprieve likely is coming to an end.
The mother of 17-month-old twins Max and Emme released a dance track, "Fresh Out of the Oven," in October and performed at the American Music Awards in December. Her new album, "Love," drops in January.
As well as having to hit the gym again, J-Lo may also have to deal with that other flip side of fame -- the paparazzi.
"It's a business. Once they stop making money off of you they stop coming around," Lopez said.
