A man who shot and killed two people at a fiber optics company in New Mexico Monday before turning the gun on himself has been identified as 37-year-old Robert Reza, a police spokesman told CNN Tuesday.
Police responded to a 911 call Monday morning from Emcore Company that multiple shots had been fired. When officers entered the building, they found a total of seven people shot. Three were dead, including the shooter, said Nadine Hamby with the Albuquerque Police Department.
Among the wounded victims was a woman who has been identified by police as the shooter's estranged girlfriend. Adrienne Basciano, 49, was in guarded condition Tuesday at the University of New Mexico Hospital, said Hamby.
Michele Turner, 36, died at the scene and Sharon Cunningham, 47, died at the University of New Mexico Hospital, Hamby said.
A woman and man, both 58, and a 54-year-old woman were released from the hospital.
Conflicting information emerged in the hours after the shooting.  Authorities first reported that six people had died, and later said three people were killed.  Earlier reports also mistakenly identified the shooter as a woman.  Police said miscommunication among officers and emergency personnel was to blame for the erroneous reports.
"We believe this incident to be a domestic violence workplace situation," Albuquerque Police Chief Ray Schultz said Monday.
Police also said that they have located the children of the gunman and his estranged girlfriend.  Schultz would only say that the children are "OK."
The roughly 85 Emcore employees who were inside the building at the time of the shooting were later interviewed at a community center near the building, authorities said.
