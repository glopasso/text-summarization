The Statue of Liberty is expected to reopen by July Fourth, Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar announced Tuesday.
The iconic landmark has been closed since October 29 due to infrastructure damage caused by Superstorm Sandy.
Funding for repairs is part of $28 million allocated by the Department of Transportation to repair federal parks and recreation areas damaged by the storm in New York and New Jersey, according to a joint press release from Salazar and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York.
Both the visitor and National Park Services docks at Liberty Island sustained significant damage during the storm, according to the National Parks Service.
Salazar also set a July Fourth deadline in 2009 for the reopening of Lady Liberty's crown after it was closed following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.
