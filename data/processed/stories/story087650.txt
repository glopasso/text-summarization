Police in northern England were called to investigate this week after children who were out trick-or-treating for Halloween were given small snap-top bags of what turned out to be cocaine.
The bags, containing white powder, were given to police after they were handed to the children Wednesday evening in the small town of Royton, Greater Manchester Police said in a statement.
Testing confirmed that they contained cocaine, and a man was arrested.
Donald Junior Green, 23, has been charged with drug possession and is due before a magistrates' court in Oldham, near Manchester, on Friday.
A 21-year-old woman was arrested on suspicion of drug possession and was later released without charge, police said.
Police Superintendent Catherine Hankinson said: "The parents and police acted quickly when this report was made, in the interests of public safety.
"We understand this to be an isolated incident."
