After a weeklong manhunt, authorities have arrested mixed martial arts fighter Jonathan Koppenhaver in Southern California for allegedly beating his ex-girlfriend in Las Vegas.
Police captured Koppenhaver, who goes by War Machine, at a motel in Simi Valley on Friday afternoon. He's originally from the suburb near Los Angeles.
"Inside the room was a small quantity of cash and some pizza," the Simi Valley Police said in a statement.
Koppenhaver has been on the run since his ex-girlfriend accused him of assault on August 8, according to CNN affiliate KVVU.
At the time, police were called to a Las Vegas home at 4 a.m. and found two people suffering from nonlife-threatening injuries, the affiliate reported.
One of the two, adult film actress Christy Mack, said Koppenhaver beat her several times during the August 8 incident, according to the affiliate.
In Twitter posts shortly after the alleged attacks, Koppenhaver appeared to address the issue. He said he had gone to the house to surprise Mack with a ring and ended "up fighting for my life."
"I only wish that man hadn't been there and that Christy & I would be happily engaged," he posted. "I don't know y I'm so cursed. One day truth will come out."
His tweets two days after the alleged incident don't say who the man in the house was.
"The cops will never give me fair play, never believe me," he posted. "Still, deciding what to do but at the end of the day, it's all just heart breaking."
Koppenhaver is awaiting extradition to Nevada, the affiliate reported.
