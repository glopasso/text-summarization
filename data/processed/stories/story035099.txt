Fidel Castro will continue to have a hand in shaping Cuba's future, but his brother and successor will remain in firm control of the government, Castro's daughter said Monday.
Alina Fernandez, daughter of Fidel Castro, has long opposed her father's regime.
"He is still behind the scenes, but Raúl is making the decisions," Alina Fernandez told CNN. "No doubt about it."
Fidel Castro's nearly five decades of rule ended Sunday when Cuba's National Assembly chose his younger brother to be the Communist nation's new president.
Raúl Castro, 76, assumed temporary control of Cuba more than a year ago after his brother suffered health problems.
The lawmakers' selection, which had been widely expected, came five days after Fidel Castro, 81, announced his resignation in a letter published in Cuba's state-run newspaper, Granma.
In his address to the National Assembly, Raúl Castro proposed that "we consult Fidel" on important decisions, which the 614 members of the legislative body unanimously passed.  Watch CNN's Morgan Neill on what the transfer of power means »
Fernandez, who lives in Florida and has long opposed her father's regime, said her uncle may bring some changes for Cuban business people and foreign relations for the the island.
"I think he will encourage some foreign investment," Fernandez said. "Small businesses also will be allowed. He wants more commerce with America, and that is what he will get."
Raúl Castro was leader of the Cuban army for almost 50 years. As Cuba's acting president, he has kept a low profile.
About six months ago, he began what he called a national debate on the problems of the country, acknowledging high unemployment and other economic concerns.
However, he has said that only the Communist Party can guarantee continuity. In his address Sunday to the National Assembly, he called the party "the guarantee of the Cuban nation." E-mail to a friend
