England wing Delon Armitage and French center Fabrice Estebanez have been suspended ahead of their two sides' Rugby World Cup quarterfinal clash in New Zealand next Saturday.
Armitage, 27, received a one-week ban for a challenge on fullback Chris Paterson during England's 16-12 defeat of Scotland on Saturday.
Estebanez, 29, was hit with a three-week suspension for a dangerous tackle on Joseph Tuinea during France's shock loss against Tonga -- a sanction which could end his participation in the tournament .
Both players have 48 hours to appeal the decision of Rugby World Cup Limited.
Armitage, who is yet to register a try in this year's tournament, is the second England player to receive a ban, after lock Courtney Lawes received a two-match suspension for recklessly striking an opponent during a clash with Argentina.
It has been a controversial campaign for England, with two members of coach Martin Johnson's staff not allowed to be on the ground for their crucial win over Scotland after being found guilty of illegally switching balls in their previous match against Romania.
On Estebanez, a statement on the four-yearly competition's official website read: "Estebanez was suspended by Independent Judicial Officer Christopher Quinlan QC (England) in accordance with the Rugby World Cup 2011 Disciplinary process.
"The suspension will take effect immediately will run up to and include 24 October. He is free to resume playing on 25 October."
