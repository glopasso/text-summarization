(CNN Student News) -- December 3, 2014
Divisions are deep across the U.S. when it comes to recent events in Ferguson, Missouri. We're exploring multiple perspectives on them at the start of today's show. We also cover concussions in high school football and the dangers of synthetic drugs. And we show you an invention that looks like a vacuum cleaner but performs like a stockperson.
