(EW.com) -- "Holler If Ya Hear Me," a new musical featuring the music of rapper Tupac Shakur, will open on Broadway at the Palace on June 19.
Preview performances for the brand-new show begin May 26. Casting for the show has not yet been announced.
Written by Todd Kreidler and directed by Tony nominee Kenny Leon (who will also direct Denzel Washington in this season's forthcoming "A Raisin in the Sun" revival), "Holler If Ya Hear Me" is an original, non-biographical story about two friends in the inner-city in the Midwest.

For what it's worth, the musical takes its title from an autobiographical song by the late rapper off his second solo album, released in 1993. In the music video, a girl witnesses her father's death, finds money to buy a gun, and subsequently rallies her young friends to ostensibly avenge his death.
The show does not purport to tell the story of Tupac Shakur, but will use his poetic music and lyrics to offer "a window into the realities of the streets still relevant today."

The packed design team includes choreographer Wayne Cilento, set designer David Gallo, costumer Reggie Ray, and lighting designer Mike Baldassari. Shakur's mother, Afeni, will serve as one of the show's producers.
