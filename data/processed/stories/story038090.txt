(EW.com) -- Director Baz Luhrmann's 3-D film "The Great Gatsby" will open in theaters nationwide and in Canada on May 10, then worldwide the following week. The film was initially scheduled to hit theaters on Christmas day, but Warner Bros. pushed the release back last August.
The adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, and Joel Edgerton.
The film will now be able to "beat on, against the current" as it will no longer be competing with The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Les MisÃ©rables, This is 40, Zero Dark Thirty, Django Unchained, and other December blockbusters.
"Audiences have been looking forward to Baz Luhrmann's film adaptation of one of the most beloved books of all time, and we felt this beautifully extravagant and dramatic film would be a perfect way for us to kick off our Summer slate," president of Warner Bros. domestic distribution Dan Fellman said in a press release.
