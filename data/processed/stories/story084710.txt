WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The number of illegal immigrants arrested along U.S. borders dropped 23 percent during the past nine months -- evidence, officials said, that stepped-up enforcement is working.
Mexican families swim and wash cars along the banks of the Rio Grande at the U.S. border in Juarez in June.
The Border Patrol captured 695,841 people nationwide in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2007, down from 907,445 for the same period the previous fiscal year, or a 23 percent drop, said Border Patrol spokesman Michael Friel.
Arrests along the U.S.-Mexico border declined by 24 percent, he said.
Border Patrol officials said the reasons for the change are varied and complex, but Friel said, "We're clearly seeing a deterrent."
One factor cited by officials is the end of the practice of releasing non-Mexican immigrants, pending court hearings.
The Border Patrol captured  50,349 non-Mexican illegal immigrants nationwide in the nine-month period ending June 30, down from 89,952 during the same period of fiscal 2006. That's a 44 percent decrease. The decrease was 48 percent for non-Mexican illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border.
Other factors include the 6,000 National Guard troops patrolling along the Southwest border, more detention space and enhanced enforcement in the interior, Friel said.
Outside economic, political and social factors also are "always involved" in fluctuating levels of immigrants seeking entry into the United States, he said.
Last month, opponents effectively killed President Bush's long-fought and emotion-laden immigration bill in the Senate when members voted against advancing the legislation.
The bill aimed to create a path to citizenship for some of the 12 million illegal immigrants and to toughen border security.
Supporters and opponents of the legislation said that it probably won't be resurrected until the 2008 elections are over. E-mail to a friend
