The son of Mexico drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman was arrested in western Mexico on Thursday, officials said.
Alfredo Guzman Salazar was arrested in Jalisco state, the Mexican navy said in a statement.
Just this month, Guzman Salazar was added to the U.S. Treasury Department's kingpin list. The department's designation freezes any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits financial and commercial transactions with him.
"We congratulate the government of Mexico and the Calderon administration on another victory against the ruthless cartels," said U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Rusty Payne. "This is the first step in bringing another ruthless drug baron to justice."
El Chapo, who oversees the powerful Sinaloa drug cartel, is considered the most wanted man in Mexico.
Guzman Salazar was indicted in Illinois, together with his father, on various drug trafficking charges in August 2009.
The arrest of El Chapo's son comes less than two weeks before Mexico's presidential elections.
According to a U.S. law enforcement official, the DEA was on the scene for the arrest and assisted the Mexican navy with intelligence to help locate Guzman Salazar.
