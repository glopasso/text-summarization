They say that all fiction can be reduced to two basic plots: "a stranger comes to town" and "a man goes on a journey."
Which suggests travel and literature make for cozy bedfellows.
Here are some of the coolest hotels inspired by writers and their work.
1. The Algonquin Hotel, New York
Following the end of World War 1, a group of young writers decided to gather daily for lunch in a hotel restaurant.
The writers worked for Vanity Fair at the time, and as their careers flourished, they became the literary lions of the day.
They were Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and Alexander Woollcott, among others, and the hotel was the Algonquin Hotel.
The New Yorker was founded inside its doors in 1925.

2. The Commons Hotel, Minneapolis
Located close to downtown Minneapolis, the Commons Hotel is a "geek chic" boutique hotel on the University of Minnesota campus.
The hotel's quirkiest feature?
Resident "book butlers" who provide guests with complimentary deliveries of a book of their choice during their stay.
Guests can choose from an in-room book menu that ranges from bestsellers to classics.
To keep with the theme, the hotel's nightly turndown service leaves a wise "quote of the day" on guests' pillows each evening.

3. The Hobbit Motel, Waitomo, New Zealand
This Lord-of-the-Rings-themed hotel, located in Otorohanga, New Zealand, came about entirely by accident.

The rooms at the Hobbit Motel include kitchens and can accommodate up to six people.
