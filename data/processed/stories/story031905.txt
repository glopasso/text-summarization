Two people died Wednesday when a car crashed into the front entrance of a Laughlin, Nevada, casino, police said.
The silver car crashed into the Edgewater Casino about 9:30 a.m., said Barbara Morgan, spokeswoman for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police.
Clark County Fire Department spokesman Scott Allison said the driver, an elderly man, was not one of the fatalities. Both victims were patrons sitting at a large bank of slot machines at the front of the casino, he said.
Five people, including the driver, were taken to hospitals, Allison said. He described one as "a major injury" with multiple fractures. Five others were treated on the scene and released, he said.
Allison said authorities suspect that the driver may have had "a medical episode" that caused the crash.
Witnesses said the car was traveling at a high speed when it hit the building, Morgan said.
Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were at the scene, she said, because the department has a substation in Laughlin, about 70 miles southeast of the city. The casino is on a highway known as "the second strip," in reference to the Las Vegas Strip.
