They didn't really look like a bird, a plane or Superman, but two high-flying acrobats did look strikingly similar to presidential candidates Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama when they jumped from a plane to promote an upcoming parachute competition.
The coordinated 12,000-foot parachute jump, complete with masks resembling the presidential candidates, was performed by Travis Fienhage and Andy Malchiodi, world and U.S. freefly champions from a California parachuting team. The duo's election season leap celebrates the coming 2012 U.S. Parachute Association's National Skydiving Championships, the world's largest skydiving competition, according to the USPA.
Five hundred of the nation's top skydiving daredevils will compete in Eloy, Arizona, from October 25 through November 3. On tap for this year's competition: formation skydiving (four-, 10- and 16-person parachute jumping teams), artistic events (which include freeflying and freestyle competitions), freefall style and accuracy landing, canopy formation and vertical formation skydiving.
For the U.S. parachute team, this will be its final chance to perfect its aerial acrobatic skills before heading to Dubai in November for the World Parachuting Championships.
