They grow up so fast.
It seems like only yesterday Tyler Posey was a child actor playing Jennifer's Lopez's son in the 2002 film "Maid in Manhattan." On Sunday night he reunited with his former co-star at the Teen Choice Awards.
The "Teen Wolf" star co-hosted the awards show and ran onstage just as Lopez was about to present an award.
"I know we haven't seen each other since 'Maid In Manhattan' forever ago, but I thought that if you needed a backup dancer, I'd fit," Posey said before breaking into some dance moves.
"If I say yes, will you stop?" Lopez replied.
Clearly Posey should stick to acting.
Since being cast as Lopez's son, Posey has worked steadily. He is best known for his role in MTV's hit series based on the 1985 "Teen Wolf" film that starred Michael J. Fox.
In 2013, Posey appeared in "Scary Movie 5," and he will next be seen in the comedy "Taco Shop," according to Internet Movie Database.
