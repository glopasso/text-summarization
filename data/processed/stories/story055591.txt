A 6.7-magnitude earthquake struck near Vancouver Island, British Columbia, on Friday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
The center of the earthquake was approximately 175 miles west of the city of Vancouver and nearly 50 miles underground.
Many people on Vancouver Island felt the quake, especially those in high-rises, which swayed back and forth, said John Cassidy of the Geological Survey in Victoria, British Columbia. He described the quake as originating 30 miles offshore.
The shaking lasted 10 to 20 seconds, Cassidy said, and there were no reports of damage or injuries Friday afternoon.
Earthquakes of such magnitude happen every decade or so, he said.
There was no immediate danger of a tsunami as a result of the earthquake, authorities at the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said.
CNN's Deanna Proeller and Michael Martinez contributed to this report.
