South Korea will step up security at Incheon International Airport following a plot uncovered last week to send bombs from Yemen to the United States.
The busy passenger and cargo hub serving the capital, Seoul, will inspect all air cargo coming from destinations on a list of 20 suspected terrorism-sponsoring nations following the discovery, the customs office said, according to the Yonhap news agency.
On Friday, authorities in the United Arab Emirates and Britain found two packages with explosives that were destined for synagogues in Chicago, Illinois, that U.S. investigators believe may be linked to an al Qaeda bomb maker, who is thought to be in Yemen.
Yemen and the United Arab Emirates are on the list of nations suspected of sponsoring terrorism, according to Yonhap.
The move comes ahead of this month's G20 summit in Seoul, which will see top officials from the world's economic powers coming to South Korea.
Passenger security will also be increased.
"Incheon International Airport will strengthen the Security Screening at security check points and the entrance of passenger terminal for the safety of passengers," a statement on the airport's website said.
