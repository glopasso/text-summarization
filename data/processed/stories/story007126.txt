A bus carrying students and faculty from Abilene Christian University to a weekend mission project overturned Friday afternoon near Paint Rock, Texas, resulting in one death and multiple injuries, the school said.
Grant Rampy, director of public relations for the university in Abilene, said the bus was headed to a children's home in Medina in south-central Texas.
The crash occurred about 3:20 p.m. on U.S. 83 in Runnels County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement.
The driver lost control and the bus struck a concrete culvert and rolled once, authorities said. Several students were ejected.
Authorities said Anabel Reid, 19, of Petersburg, Texas, was pronounced dead at the scene.
A number of helicopters were brought in to fly the injured to area hospitals, Rampy said. The victims had varying degrees of injury.
The 2009 bus, registered to the university, is equipped for 24 passengers and a driver, officials said.
The school's website said that 12 students, three faculty members and the spouse of one faculty member were on board. They were representing the Department of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences. The Department of Public Safety said 16 people were on the bus.
Top leaders in the university administration traveled to four hospitals to be with families. A prayer service was held at the campus amphitheater.
