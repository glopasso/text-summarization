Inter Milan striker Samuel Eto'o has received a three-match ban for head-butting Chievo's Bostjan Cesar in the chest at last Sunday's Serie A game.
Eto'o, who scored as Inter went down 2-1 to Chievo, escaped punishment during the game as the incident, which happened in the 38th minute, was not seen by match officials.
The Italian Football Federation decided to issue Eto'o with a ban after reviewing video evidence.
In issuing the ban, they described the head-butt as "premeditated" and constituted "violent conduct."
The Cameroon international was also fined €30,000 ($40,000), but is available for Inter's Champions League fixture with FC Twente on Wednesday.
Inter say they intend to appeal the ban.
