(EW.com) -- JUSTIN GRANT WADE!
Just doesn't have the same ring, does it? But that hasn't stopped friends and fans of the actor -- who played the compulsive name announcer, letterman jacket wearer, and illegitimate son of Gob Bluth on "Arrested Development" -- from mounting an online campaign to bring back Wade and his character when the show returns via Netflix in early 2013 and in the feature film to follow.
Wade himself has even gotten in on the act, recording a video plea on SaveSteveHolt.com, acknowledging he hasn't yet been asked to return to the show for its fourth season and assuring fans "a portion of the profits will be going to a very good cause."
Is that cause a date and/or therapy session for Maeby and George Michael? He also announced that he'll be participating in an "Ask Me Anything" session on the subReddit for "Arrested Development" in a couple of weeks. Stay tuned!
If you could ask Wade anything, what would you ask him? Are you on Team STEVE HOLT!? And what tertiary character(s) would you like brought back? Tony "Buster Bluth" Hale already registered his vote for Liza Minnelli to reprise her role as Lucille 2. Perhaps you're most titillated by the prospect of herpetic sexertary Kitty Sanchez (Judy Greer). Maybe you still haven't gotten the Britishish jingle for MRF Rita Leeds (Charlize Theron) out of your head. Or perchance you're craving a law blog from Bob Loblaw (Scott Baio)? Sound off in the comments below.
