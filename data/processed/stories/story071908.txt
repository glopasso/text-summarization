Prince William and Kate Middleton will have a wedding reception hosted by the queen at Buckingham Palace, the royal family announced Wednesday.
The palace also said the wedding service will begin at 11 a.m. on Friday, April 29, the date previously announced for the nuptials at Westminster Abbey.
The Dean of Westminster will conduct the service, and Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams will marry the couple, the palace said. The Bishop of London will give the address.
After the wedding, the couple will go to Buckingham Palace for the reception, which will have guests "drawn from the congregation representing the couple's official and private lives," the palace said.
William's father, Prince Charles, will give a private dinner that evening followed by dancing, all to be held at the palace for the couple and their close friends and family.
Those hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal couple will have plenty of chances. The palace said Middleton will travel to the wedding on a route that includes famous and picturesque London attractions, including The Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall, and Parliament Square.
Once married, the couple will return along the same processional route to Buckingham Palace.
British Prime Minister David Cameron has already said the wedding day will be a national holiday, and the event is expected to draw visitors from all over the world.
William and Middleton, both 28, announced their engagement November 16. They met each other when they were studying at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland and started dating in 2003.
The couple have already announced that after the wedding, they plan to live in north Wales, where William is serving as a search-and-rescue pilot for the Royal Air Force.
