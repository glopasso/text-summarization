The widower of actress Brittany Murphy, found dead in his home Sunday night, was scheduled to undergo heart bypass surgery this summer, a spokesman for the actress' mother said.
British screenwriter Simon Monjack, 39, was pronounced dead after the Los Angeles Fire Department was called to his Hollywood home for a medical emergency, police said.
There were no signs of foul play or criminal activity in the death, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Alex Ortiz said.
Roger Neal, a spokesman for Murphy's mother, Sharon, said Monjack delayed the heart surgery until after a fundraising gala for the Brittany Murphy Foundation in September.
Murphy, his wife of less than three years, died just five months ago.
Sharon Murphy found Monjack unconscious in his bedroom and called the fire department, a family friend said.
An autopsy is scheduled to be conducted Tuesday, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's spokeswoman.
Sharon Murphy, who shared the house with Monjack, "loved him like a son" and is devastated by his death, Neal said.
It is the same Hollywood Hills home where Brittany Murphy lived.
Murphy, 32, died in December from a combination of pneumonia, an iron deficiency and multiple drug intoxication, a coroner said. The drugs involved were legal and used to treat a respiratory infection, according to an autopsy.
The often bubbly, free-spirited actress appeared in films such as "Clueless," "8 Mile," "Don't Say a Word" and "Girl, Interrupted."
She also lent her voice to animated works, including the movie "Happy Feet" -- in which she also sang -- and a regular role on the animated TV series "King of the Hill."
Monjack and Murphy were married in May 2007. The couple had no children.
The foundation's gala, which still may be held, was organized to raise money for children to study music, dance and other arts, Neal said.
