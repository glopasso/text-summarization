In some corners of the Internet, Kim Kardashian is already Mrs. Kanye West.
The 33-year-old reality star isn't expected to marry West until May 24, but a May 4 report from Life & Style Weekly stirred speculation that the couple have already obtained a marriage license in California.
Whether or not that's true is up for debate. Both People magazine and E! News cite sources who say that Kardashian and West, 36, haven't yet made their impending union official.
A rep for the reality star isn't commenting on the reports and Kardashian hasn't spoken on them either, but she has let a few details slip about her upcoming nuptials.
"We will be getting married ... in Paris," Kardashian told Jimmy Kimmel earlier this year. "We love it there. It's like our second home, we spend so much time there."
And according to the "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" star, her husband-to-be has been hands-on with the planning process.
"I know they think or they say that the guy usually doesn't care and just shows up, but Kanye really cares and is really passionate about it, so it makes my job so much easier," she said. "I love it because he knows what he wants, and I love that about him."
West popped the question to Kardashian with an over-the-top proposal in October 2013, a few months after the couple welcomed their first child together, daughter North.
