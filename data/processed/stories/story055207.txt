A wave of violence struck Iraq on Tuesday, with bomb blasts and gun battles killing at least six people and wounding more than 20, police officials told CNN.
It's the latest violence to strike Iraq, where nearly 200 people have been killed and hundreds more wounded in bomb blasts and gunfights across the country since April 23.
There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the attacks, nor was it clear whether they were related.
Among the attacks was a bomb blast at a coffee shop in Muqdadiyah, north of Baghdad, that killed one person and wounded nine, a police official said.
In Baghdad, roadside bombs killed three people and wounded six, a police official said.
Gunmen also reportedly killed an anti-government demonstration organizer in Haditha, while a Ministry of Industry employee was gunned down in northern Baghdad, officials said.
CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.
