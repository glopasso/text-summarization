What can be more in the Christmas spirit than Grumpy Cat?
That is, if "Christmas spirit" equals "Bah, humbug."
The frown-faced feline lives up to her billing in a trailer for, yes, a Grumpy Cat movie, "Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever." The film, which will air on Lifetime on November 29 -- the day after Thanksgiving -- features the voice of "Parks and Recreation's" Aubrey Plaza as our furry heroine.
Plaza is no deadpan Bill Murray-as-Garfield, but she gets off some zingers in the trailer, which shows a little girl (Megan Charpentier) getting her wish of a friend for the holidays.
"You really screwed up your big wish," Grumpy Cat tells the girl, who can apparently hear her thoughts.
Grumpy Cat has been an Internet sensation since photos hit Reddit in the fall of 2012. The cat, whose real name is Tardar Sauce, now has her own website, coffee brand, merchandise and Twitter page -- not to mention countless Internet memes.

Grumpy Cat's owner, Tabatha Bundesen, said in 2013 that she's pleased her cat makes people happy.
"I don't mind it," she said of her pet's celebrity. "I'm thrilled to see that my cat brings joy to people."
Sounds like a perfect match for Christmas.
