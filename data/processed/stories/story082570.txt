A judge restored Katherine Jackson as permanent guardian of Michael Jackson's children and approved a plan to add their cousin T.J. Jackson as co-guardian during a hearing Thursday.
"It's clear to me that the children are well-cared-for by Mrs. Jackson," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said. "It's clear to me that they love her very much and they have substantial significant relations with T.J. Jackson and love him very much."
The decision comes in a hearing eight days after the same court suspended the family matriarch as guardian because she had been gone and out of communications with the three children for 10 days.

T.J. Jackson, the 34-year-old son of Jackson 5 original Tito Jackson, was appointed temporary guardian last week. A hearing August 22 will determine if he will remain as a co-guardian with his grandmother. The judge said he is already inclined to grant it.
The initial report suggests there are "things about T.J. Jackson that the kids can relate to," Beckloff said.
T.J. Jackson has been caring for the children in the past whenever their grandmother was away, her lawyer said.
A court investigator interviewed Katherine Jackson and the children -- Prince, Paris and Blanket -- on Friday, he said.
"The kids seem to be doing very, very well," Beckloff said. "All of the controversy caused me great concern."
Diana Ross, whom Michael Jackson named as a backup guardian in his will, visited with the children Wednesday and agreed with the plan, according to the lawyer who represents the children. It was a private meeting at their home, another lawyer said.
The co-guardianship arrangement, which is supported by the three children, codifies "the very thing that's been in place since Michael's death," Katherine Jackson lawyer Perry Sanders said after the hearing.
