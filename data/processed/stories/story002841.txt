Your Twitter profile is about to have a new look.
Calling the changes "a whole new you," Twitter announced Tuesday that it will be rolling out a fresh design and new features to user profile pages. The company says the changes will make self-expression on the social network "even easier" and "more fun."
The new design gives Twitter users a much larger profile photo and a customized header image. Twitter says the new profile will highlight specific tweets and allow people searching through profile pages to find the kind of tweets they want. For example, followers can choose to see just tweets with photos and videos or replies in Twitter conversations.
A user can pin a favorite tweet to the top of his or her profile page, while tweets with the most retweets and replies will appear slightly larger so they are easier for others to find.
The new profile pages are currently available only to a small group of existing users as well as those new to Twitter. The social media company says the new features will be available to everyone in the coming weeks.
Among the first Twitter users to get the new profile design: first lady Michelle Obama (@flotus), boxer Floyd Mayweather (@FloydMayweather), actress Kerry Washington (@kerrywashington), and the band Weezer (@weezer).
