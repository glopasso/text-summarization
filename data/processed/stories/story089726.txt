The Japanese MotoGP will go ahead as planned after a report found that radiation risks from the nearby Fukushima plant damaged in March's earthquake and tsunami were negligible.
The October 2 race is to be staged at the Motegi Twin Ring circuit which is 110 miles from the nuclear plant that was badly damaged by the devastating natural disasters that hit the Asian country.
Several riders have previously said they would not race at the track but a report published on Tuesday by the International Motorcycling Federation (FIM) found the likely radiation risk was similar to that of Rome or Madrid.
It read: "Based on this report the FIM and Dorna Sports (race organizers) confirm today that, subject to there being no further serious incidents, the Grand Prix of Japan will take place on 2 October as planned.
"As already indicated, ARPA (the agency commissioned to do the report by FIM) has measured levels of radiation from all sources including the air, environment and food.
"The final conclusion is that 'based on the estimate dose it can be said with no doubt that the radiation risk during the race event is negligible.'"
Reigning world champion and current championship leader Jorge Lorenzo said in July that he would not take part in the race and claimed many of his fellow riders felt the same way.
