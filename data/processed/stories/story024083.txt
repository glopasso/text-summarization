There may be a little bit of panic that sets in as you approach a toll booth and you realize you don't have any money on you.
But apparently not for some people in Texas.
Take, for instance, a man and woman from Pflugerville. According to the Texas Department of Transportation, their vehicle has passed a toll booth without someone paying more than 14,000 times.
Make that 14,358, to be exact. Well, through Wednesday.
And the state really, really wants them to pay their bill -- $236,026.32 -- for the unpaid tolls and fines (the fines always get you).
Texas gave the duo and other toll scofflaws until Wednesday to pay up or else. The else turns out to be the state publicly releasing the names of the people it says are the top 25 violators.
Congratulations, Austin! All 25 are from your area.
Sixteen drivers owe more than $100,000, The state says all told it is owed $27 million from across the state -- at least 28,000 drivers owe more than $100 in unpaid tolls.
There is good news; Texas is willing to negotiate a settlement or give violators the option of a payment plan.
CNN affiliate KXAN reported officials said they have already sent letters and made phone calls to people in advance of Wednesday's deadline.
By the way, if you were wondering, if someone drove twice each day on a toll road without paying, it would take 19Â½ years to amass 14,000 violations.
Texas also says if violators are pulled over for a traffic violation, they can have their cars impounded.
