Thousands of travelers in France were stranded after lightning shut down a main train station on Saturday, the first day of the summer holiday for students.
Lightening struck an electrical facility in Bretigny-sur-Orge, on the outskirts of Paris, forcing the closure of the Austerlitz station and affecting 40,000 travelers, a French National Railway official told CNN.
However, traffic at Austerlitz station had resumed as of 6 p.m. (noon ET), CNN affiliate BFM reported, citing officials with railway agency. Electronic repairs on the railway had been completed by the evening, and traffic was expected to run smoothly by Sunday.
Earlier, railway officials had warned of delays and encouraged passengers to postpone their trips. Passengers who were unable to take trains Saturday will be issued refunds, BFM reported.
The station is used by trains leaving for southern France and Spain as well as commuter service to other parts of Paris.
