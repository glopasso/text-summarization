Lady Gaga may love to "Just Dance," but she will be off the dance floor for a while.
The pop icon canceled the rest of her "Born This Way Ball" tour this week because doctors found she had suffered a labral tear in her right hip.
Initially, Gaga, 26, said she had been hiding pain in her hip for a while and that she had a condition called synovitis, a severe inflammation of the synovial lining of her hip joint. Later, doctors determined the singer also had the tear.
Tour operator Live Nation said strenuous repetitive movements caused the tear.
"(A labral tear) affects a younger subset of patients," said Allston Stubbs, an orthopedic surgeon at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
"We think it's related to the repetitive mechanics of being active."
Think of the labrum as a ring of soft tissue that holds the ball of the femur, or thighbone, snugly in the hip joint's socket.
Lady Gaga cancels tour, will, will have hip surgery
Live Nation said Gaga "will need surgery to repair the problem, followed by strict downtime to recover. This unfortunately will force her to cancel the tour so she can heal."
New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez, 37, had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his right hip in 2009 and then in his left hip last month.
"A lot of these patients have been involved with a fairly high level of activity for a long time," Stubbs said.
The average age of patients in Stubbs' clinic with this type of injury is 30, he said. Because many of them started being active when they were younger, adolescents and teenagers need to know how to stretch properly to prevent these types of injuries.
"I recommend two months of rest within a 12-month period, particularly in patients 16 and younger," Stubbs said.
"We want them to be active, but we also went them to allow time for their bodies to rest and recover."
