An earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Bali early Thursday, rattling buildings and sending dozens to hospitals with minor injuries.
The 6.0-magnitude quake hit 100 km (62 miles) southwest of Bali, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
At least 43 people were taken to local hospitals, including five who suffered serious injuries, medical officials said.
A few suffered broken bones and are undergoing treatment, said Wayan Sudanti, an official at a local hospital.
Another medical official at a nearby hospital said several others were undergoing treatment for minor injuries, but did not specify how many.
The quake had a depth of 38 miles, and no tsunami alert was issued, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
Indonesia is on the so-called Ring of Fire, an arc of fault lines circling the Pacific Basin that is prone to frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
In 2004, a 9.1-magnitude underwater earthquake struck off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed more than 200,000 people in 14 countries.
The tsunami, which washed away entire communities, caused nearly $10 billion in damage and more casualties than any other tsunami in history, according to the United Nations.
Indonesia was among the hardest hit nations.
