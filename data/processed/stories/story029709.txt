Jeremy Lin, who brought "Linsanity" into the lexicon when he came off the bench and led the New York Knicks to a string of wins, suffered a knee injury and will be out about six weeks, the team said Saturday.
The injury could sideline the guard, 23, for the rest of the season.
An MRI revealed a small chronic meniscus tear in Lin's left knee, the Knicks said on their Twitter page.
The unlikely star of Taiwanese descent and Harvard degree quickly turned into a global brand, but the team has cooled off somewhat since he rose to prominence.
Lin noticed the injury about a week ago, but he told reporters it had not gotten better by Saturday.
"I can't really do much, can't really cut or jump, so it's pretty clear I can't help the team unless I get it fixed right now," said Lin.
Lin, who averaged 14.6 points and 6.1 assists per game, said he will undergo surgery early next week. Rehabilitation will take about six weeks, he said.
Lin burst onto the basketball scene in early February when then-Knicks coach Mike D'Antoni called him off the bench as the Knicks struggled against the New Jersey Nets. Lin responded with 25 points, leading the Knicks to victory.
A seven-game winning streak, including a victory over All-Star Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers, followed, with Lin coming up with clutch plays to lead the way.
"The season has had a lot of downs and a lot of ups," Lin said Saturday. "As a team we're doing OK and will be just fine. Obviously, it's been a very emotional year."
