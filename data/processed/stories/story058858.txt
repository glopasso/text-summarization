It didn't come close to matching last year's record time but supermaxi Wild Oats XI won a record-tying seventh Rolex Sydney to Hobart yacht race on Saturday.
Wild Oats XI coasted home in the 628-nautical mile race in two days, six hours and a fraction over seven minutes, which was well off the 2012 mark of one day, 18 hours and 23 minutes.
Still, Wild Oats XI managed to equal the record of Morna, which was later called Kurrewa IV.
It bagged its seven titles in the 1940s,1950s and 1960.
"This is one of the best wins you could possible have with a lot of new competition and a lot of anxiety, not knowing how we were going to go against each other," Wild Oats XI's skipper, Mark Richards, was quoted as saying by the Sydney Morning Herald.
Wild Oats XI took control of the race and didn't relinquish its advantage after passing Perpetual LOYAL on Friday.
Wild Oats XI's billionaire owner, wine maker Bob Oatley, added that more victories could be on the way.
"We've got a great future, more wins," he told reporters. "It's beautiful, it's wonderfully built."
Perpetual LOYAL finished second, more than three hours behind Wild Oats XI.
