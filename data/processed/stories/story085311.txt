The Duchess of Cambridge attended her first public engagement since her pregnancy was announced this month, presenting prizes at a sports awards show Sunday evening in London.
Catherine appeared on stage at London's ExCel center to rousing applause, to present the awards at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year show. She wore a striking, floor-length green dress that showed off her slim figure and featured a daring slit.
She handed over trophies for the night's two biggest awards: Sports Personality of the Year, which went to 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins; and the Lifetime Achievement honor, which went to Lord Sebastian Coe, chairman of the London 2012 Olympics organizing committee.
The duchess was last seen December 6 alongside her husband, Prince William, leaving the hospital where she had undergone several days of treatment for acute morning sickness.
Her stay at the King Edward VII Hospital was overshadowed by the apparent suicide of Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse who took a prank phone call from Australian DJs. The pair made the hoax call to the hospital, pretending to be Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles in an effort to find out details of Catherine's condition.
Catherine's illness had led the couple to announce her pregnancy earlier than the usual 12-week mark; the royal couple have not announced when their baby is due.
Health concerns have forced Catherine to pull out of several events in recent weeks, including the UK premiere of "The Hobbit" in London this week; Prince William attended the event alone.
