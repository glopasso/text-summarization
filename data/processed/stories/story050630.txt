Scout Willis definitely walks the walk.
The 22-year-old daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis took a topless stroll down the streets of New York and documented it on social media to protest what she says is discrimination on the photo sharing site Instagram.
Wearing just a skirt, shoes, her purse and a determined look, Willis walked around the streets of Manhattan and even did a bit of shopping for some flowers. She tweeted the pics as well as "Legal in NYC but not on Instagram," and "What @Instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple."
The New York Daily News reported that Willis launched her skin campaign after Instagram removed one of her photos it said violated its community guidelines. The picture reportedly included a sweatshirt that depicted two topless women with the nipples visible.
The actress said Instagram removed her account, but she complained that other explicit photos -- including one with a woman hiding her nipples using a pair of handguns -- were allowed.
"Made a new Instagram, gonna post lots of beautiful photos of naked women I think. Tasteful, non aggressive, whomever wants to see can, if not," Willis tweeted before her topless walk.
She also explained on Twitter the message she was hoping to spread.
"This is about helping women feel empowered to make personal choices about their bodies not dictated by what society says is decent," she tweeted.
In New York City it is legal for a law-abiding woman to be topless in public.
