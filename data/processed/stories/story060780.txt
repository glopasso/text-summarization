Is this the quintessential TMI Facebook post?
Rep. Mark Sanford, the former South Carolina governor known for having an extramarital affair while his staff claimed he was hiking the Appalachian Trail, wrote in a 2,300-word Facebook post Friday that he and his Argentine fiancée have broken up.
The congressman says the strains between him and his ex-wife have complicated his relationship with his three children, as well as his relationship with fiancée Maria Belen Chapur.
Sanford and Chapur got engaged in August 2012, a few years after he publicly admitted that he had been cheating on his wife.
The Sanfords divorced after the scandal, and the then-governor finished his time in office, leaving the governorship in January 2011. The Republican, who was once considered a potential presidential contender, mounted a political comeback and won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013.
In the Facebook post, Sanford says he's being summoned to court on Monday as part of what he described as "yet another lawsuit" by his ex-wife.
