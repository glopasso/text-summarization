Myanmar's Supreme Court rejected Friday an appeal by pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to overturn her house arrest.
A diplomat who attended the hearing and spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the appeal was unsuccessful.
Suu Kyi, 64, has one final avenue for appeal to a special court in Myanmar's new capital, Naypidaw.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate's house arrest was extended by 18 months last August after an incident in which uninvited American John Yettaw stayed at her lakeside home. Myanmar's ruling military junta accused Suu Kyi of breaching the terms of her house arrest.
She has been imprisoned or under house arrest for much of the past two decades, since her party the National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory in 1990. The junta has never recognized the results, but has promised to hold fresh elections this year, although no date has yet been set.
Suu Kyi is disqualified from standing because she was married to a foreigner. The NLD has still to clarify whether it will participate in the vote.
