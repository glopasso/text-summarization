(CNN)  -- Liverpool striker Ryan Babel has been charged with improper conduct by the English Football Association (FA) following his criticism of referee Howard Webb on Twitter.
Webb, who took charge of the 2010 World Cup final between Spain and the Netherlands, awarded a controversial first minute penalty against Liverpool in their 1-0 FA Cup third round defeat to Manchester United on Sunday.
Webb also sent off Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard for a first half challenge on Michael Carrick, again hotly disputed.
Dutch international Babel used his Twitter blog to post a mocked-up picture of Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt.

Babel also wrote: "And they call him one of the best referees? That's a joke."
The 24-year-old later apologized, saying his remarks were light-hearted.
"My apology if they take my posted pic seriously. This is just an emotional reaction after losing an important game.
"Sorry Howard Webb."
In a statement Monday, the FA said the charge "relates to comments and images published by the player on Twitter concerning referee Howard Webb."
Babel has until Thursday to respond to the charge, the first time such action has been taken by the FA over a Twitter posting.
He has previously run into problems over his tweets, having to apologize for former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez after being dropped from the team.
