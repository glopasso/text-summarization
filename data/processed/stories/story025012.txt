Last week, Ashley Moser lost her daughter Veronica when the young girl was among 12 people killed when a man opened fire in a packed Colorado movie theater.
And now she's suffered another tragedy.
Moser was among scores wounded in the Aurora shooting. She is one of 11 victims still recovering at three hospitals, including five in critical condition.
"Tragically, the extreme trauma she sustained also caused a miscarriage," the Moser family said in a statement Saturday.
Funeral arrangements for 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan are still pending, according to the statement.
The girl was the youngest person killed in the rampage, which authorities say was carried out by a 24-year-old recent dropout from a Ph.D. program in neuroscience at the University of Colorado-Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. He is being held without bond in a Colorado prison.
4 victims remembered at memorials
Veronica's mother, meanwhile, faces significant physical and emotional challenges, undergoing an additional surgery Saturday morning.
The family statement asked people to go to any Wells Fargo bank to donate to the "Donation Account for Ashley and Veronica Moser" to help her in the months and years ahead.
"Our sincere appreciation goes out to all of those who have been sending well-wishes, prayers and good thoughts to Ashley," the family said. "Her lifetime of care will be a long road."
