Several Jamaican sprinters were banned for doping earlier this year and now a footballer from the Caribbean nation has been suspended.
Jermaine Hue, a creative midfielder who has made more than 40 appearances for the national team, received a nine-month suspension after he tested positive for dexamethasone.
But a stiffer penalty was given to the team doctor, Carlton Fraser. He was hit with a four-year punishment after "having administered" the corticosteroid, FIFA said in a statement on its website.
The two were provisionally banned in August after Hue tested positive following Jamaica's World Cup qualifier at Honduras in June.
Hue, 35, has spent most of his career with Jamaica's Harbour View but had brief stints with the Kansas City Wizards of the MLS and Sweden's Mjallby.
According to a report in the Jamaica Observer in August, Fraser was a personal friend of the late Bob Marley and also treated the reggae great.
The sanctions are a further blow to the 'Reggae Boyz' -- they sit last in their qualifying group with only two matches remaining.
Former world-record holder in the 100 meters, Asafa Powell, and Sherone Simpson admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July, a month after double 200-meter Olympic gold medalist Veronica Campbell-Brown received a provisional ban.
