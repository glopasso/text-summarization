An X-Box and games, a silver iPod, a Nintendo Wii -- and a wooden knife holder missing two knives -- are among the items removed from the home of the Pennsylvania teenager suspected of going on a stabbing rampage at his Pennsylvania high school, according to court papers.
Authorities removed those things from a home owned by the parents of suspect Alex Hribal, according to an affidavit CNN has obtained. Sixteen-year-old Hribal is alleged to have seriously injured at least 20 students and a security officer at Franklin Regional Senior High School in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, on April 9.
The teen has been arraigned as an adult. He faces four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault.
Murrysville, with a population of about 20,000, is a quiet middle-class enclave roughly 20 miles east of Pittsburgh on U.S. Route 22.
