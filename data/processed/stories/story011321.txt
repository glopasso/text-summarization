Rosie O'Donnell will be sporting a new look when she returns to "The View" in May.
The former talk show host has tweeted a picture of herself after a significant weight loss. "Almost 50 lbs off - I can see it now," O'Donnell tweeted.
The 52-year-old actress reportedly underwent weight-loss surgery in 2013 after a series of health issues including a heart attack in 2012.
"I did what many women do, and I did not take care of myself," she said during a speech at an American Heart Association luncheon in Detroit in February. "And that's why I'm here, to try to get women to know you're worth it, take care of yourself and know the symptoms."
At the time of her speech, O'Donnell said she had lost 40 pounds after gastric sleeve surgery.
O'Donnell is set to appear with all of the other former and present co-hosts of "The View" in May for a special episode honoring the retirement of Barbara Walters.
