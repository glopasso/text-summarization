(EW.com) -- Sony Pictures has started development on the fourth movie in the "Men in Black" franchise, EW has confirmed. The Wrap first reported the news.
The 'Men in Black 3' ending makes no sense, no sense at all
Oren Uziel, who is writing the upcoming "Mortal Kombat" movie, has scored the screenwriting gig for "MIB 4." He is also writing Sony's sequel to "21 Jump Street," last year's hit comedy starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.
That sequel will open on June 6, 2014. No release date has been set for "MIB 4."
