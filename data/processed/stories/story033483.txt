Back in 1993, my friend Craig Pollard set out with a very simple mission. He wanted to help cancer survivors realize their dreams of a college education.
As a two-time cancer survivor himself, Craig saw first hand how the disease can devastate a family physically, emotionally and financially. Even families with great insurance can exhaust all their resources trying to return their children to good health, leaving little if nothing for that child's continued education.
Since inception, Cancer for College has granted over $2 million in scholarships to more than 1,000 survivors from around the country. It's an opportunity for these young people who have had to endure so much to feel like they can return to some kind of normalcy in their lives. All the applicant stories are so inspiring with many of the survivors wanting to go on to become doctors, nurses and counselors. Some even go on to work in the very hospitals where they were treated.
Thanks for watching our CNN Interview. We appreciate you taking the time to learn more about our cause. If you'd like to contribute, click the donate button or visitwww.cancerforcollege.org for more info on what we are doing to help make the college dreams of cancer survivors come true.
