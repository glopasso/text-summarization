U.S. and Australian officials are warning of an online threat against international teachers in the Middle East.
An anonymous posting on a jihadist website is encouraging attacks against foreign teachers, said the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.
"The Mission is unaware of any specific, credible threat against any Americans or other school or individual in the United Arab Emirates," the embassy said Wednesday. "Nonetheless, the Mission is working with local schools identified with the United States to review their security posture."
Australian officials issued a similar security alert, citing a recent posting on a jihadist website encouraging attacks against teachers, including Australian teachers, at international schools around the world.
"The website post notes the presence of international schools in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan, Tunisia, Nigeria, Morocco, Malaysia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia," the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said.
"It makes specific mention of two schools in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia (American International School and Advanced Generations School) and the suburb of Ma'adi, in Cairo, Egypt, where numbers of teachers at international schools reside."
The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, issued a similar warning on October 27, citing schools in the areas of Jeddah and the Cairo suburb of Maadi as examples of potential targets.
But the mission in Riyadh also said it was unaware of any specific, credible threat against any American school or person in Saudi Arabia.
The U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi offered several tips for staying safe, including:
â€¢ Avoiding crowds and large gatherings.
â€¢ Having a plan of what to do if demonstrations or violence starts.
â€¢ Keeping a low profile while in public.
