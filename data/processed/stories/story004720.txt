(CNN Student News) -- September 12, 2013
On Thursday's edition of CNN Student News, we recap President Obama's speech regarding Syria, and we share one U.S. senator's response. We also report on violence in Libya, and we show how Americans remembered the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And in an industry focused on looks, one model hopes to make a difference by standing out.
