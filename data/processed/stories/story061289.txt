(CNN)Justin Timberlake is expecting "the greatest gift ever" this year: a baby.
After months of speculation, the singer confirmed Saturday that his wife, Jessica Biel, is expecting their first child. News of the impending arrival came on his 34th birthday.
In a social media post, Timberlake said they don't know the sex of the baby yet, but are taking bets. The post included a picture of him lovingly cradling and kissing what appears to be his wife's baby bump.
"Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes! This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT," Timberlake said on Instagram.
Biel has appeared in various movies, including "Valentine's Day" and the TV series "7th Heaven."
The two were married in southern Italy in 2012, but rarely reveal information about their relationship.
In October, Timberlake posted an Instagram picture of them sitting on a bench near a lake,  providing a rare insight into their life.
"'Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it," he posted under the picture, using a quote from the movie "Ferris Bueller's Day Off."
Biel has been pictured with a baby bump lately, but this is the first time the couple has confirmed it.
