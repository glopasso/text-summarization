(RollingStone.com) -- Only a few months after joining the Pixies, bassist Kim Shattuck is already out of the band.
The Muffs frontwoman shared the news on November 29 with a message on Twitter and Facebook.
"Super disappointed to learn that my time with the Pixies ended today," she wrote. "Amazing experience. Looking forward to focusing my attention back on the Muffs and our upcoming new album. All the best to everyone."

Shattuck began her post with the Pixies in July, after founding bassist Kim Deal suddenly quit the band in the middle of the recording sessions for their latest release, "EP-1."

"[Deal] just had enough," the band's manager, Richard Jones, told Rolling Stone in an interview earlier this year. "She didn't want to do all the things that go with releasing new music, as in all the traveling and touring. She just decided that she wanted to move on."
In the same interview, frontman Black Francis said that the band realized that they needed to replace Deal with another female bassist.

"A lot of our songs have that romantic loss, romantic gain, sexuality thing," he said. "We need the female and male represented."
Less than a month after the Pixies announced Deal's departure, Shattuck was on board and touring with the group.
The Pixies kick off their North American tour on January 15 in Toronto. It's not currently clear who will be playing bass now in the absence of both Kims.
