(CNN)  -- Manchester United's new goalscoring machine Javier Hernandez grabbed a late winner as the holders reached the quarterfinals of the English League Cup with a 3-2 win over Wolves.
Mexican international Hernandez, nicknamed 'little pea' strode on to a Darron Gibson pass before beating visiting goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey for his last minute clincher at Old Trafford.
Hernandez had been introduced as a late substitute for Bebe, but not before the young Portuguese find had put United ahead early in the second half.
It was Bebe's first goal since his surprise summer signing for United from Estrela Amorada.
He showed enough in a tepid first half and with his goal, admittedly after a deflection, to suggest that manager Alex Ferguson's gamble on a player he admitted he had not seen play, could pay off.
But Wolves threatened an upset with George Elokobi muscling his way through to level from a corner, while the returning Stephen Hunt saw his shot clip the top of the crossbar as United wobbled.
Then Korean Park Ji-Sung, having wasted an earlier cast-iron chance, put United ahead again with a clever shot from inside the area.
But Wolves leveled again through Kevin Foley and looked set to force injury time until Hernandez, who scored twice in the 2-1 win at Stoke in the Premier League on Saturday, popped up again.
"When he comes on, you just know that if he gets a chance he is going to take it," Ferguson told Sky Sports.
In other League Cup action, Premier League Wigan beat Swansea 2-0 and Birmingham saw off the challenge of third-flight Brentford in a penalty shoot out.
High-flying West Bromwich Albion continued their fine form with a 4-1 win at Sven-Goran Eriksson's Leicester.
