The Federal Aviation Administration found no evidence of unidentified aircraft or objects in its inquiry into a corporate jet pilot's claim he saw a possible remote-controlled aircraft flying near his jet over Denver this week, the agency said Thursday.
In reaching its conclusion, the FAA reviewed radar and audio communications, and no other pilots reported seeing an unidentified aircraft, acording to an agency statement.
On Monday, the pilot of a corporate jet, a Cessna Citation 525 CJ1, was flying over Denver on Monday after coming in from Wichita, Kansas, according to CNN affiliate KUSA.
The pilot made a radio transmission to air traffic control about the object, KUSA reported, citing LiveATC.net.
"A remote-controlled aircraft, or what, but something just went by the other way. ... About 20 to 30 seconds ago, and it was like a large remote-controlled aircraft," the pilot said.
