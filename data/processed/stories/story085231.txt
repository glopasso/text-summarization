The Taliban stoned to death a man and a woman in northern Afghanistan for allegedly having an affair, officials said Monday.
The stoning took place Sunday in Dasht-e-Archi district, in the village of Mullah Qali -- a village dominated by the Taliban in Kunduz province.
The pair was accused of having an illicit sexual relationship, a spokesman for the Kunduz governor said.

The woman was about 20 years old and the man was about 27, said Mohammed Ayuob, district governor of Amam Sahib, which is also in Kunduz province.
The woman was engaged, and the man was married to another woman. The two had been held by the Taliban for about a week, Ayuob said.
