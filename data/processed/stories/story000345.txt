So, Gary Oldman, tell us what you really think.
In a raw interview with Playboy, the actor, 56, railed against Hollywood "dishonesty" and double standards, said that Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin have been victims of hypocrisy and asserted that not voting for "12 Years a Slave" to win an Oscar meant "you were a racist."
Oh, and he doesn't like the Golden Globes, helicopter parents or reality TV, either.
Indeed, the "Dark Knight" actor, who's starring in the forthcoming "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes," pulled no punches when talking about pretty much anything. The conversation will appear in the magazine's July/August issue.
The Gibson and Baldwin affairs really angered him, he said, because he believes their accusers don't exactly have clean hands themselves.
"I don't know about Mel. He got drunk and said a few things, but we've all said those things. We're all f***ing hypocrites," Oldman said. "The policeman who arrested him has never used the word 'n*****' or 'that f***ing Jew'? I'm being brutally honest here. It's the hypocrisy of it that drives me crazy.
"Mel Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he's actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him -- and doesn't need to feed him anymore because he's got enough dough," Oldman continued. "But some Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn't turned and said, 'That f***ing kraut' or 'F*** those Germans,' whatever it is? We all hide and try to be so politically correct. That's what gets me. It's just the sheer hypocrisy of everyone."
Other Oldman tidbits:
On reality TV: "The museum of social decay."
On helicopter parents: "There's never any unsupervised play to develop skills or learn about hierarchy in a group or how to share. The kids honestly believe they are the center of the f***ing universe. But then they get out into the real world and it's like, 'S**t, maybe it's not all about me,' and that leads to narcissism, depression and anxiety."
On political correctness at the Oscars: "At the Oscars, if you didn't vote for '12 Years a Slave' you were a racist. "
On the Golden Globes: "A meaningless event. ... It's 90 nobodies having a wank."
If Oldman is hard on Hollywood and its people, he's equally critical of himself. Asked about "Sid & Nancy," his breakthrough film, he said, "I don't like myself in the movie." Ditto with "The Fifth Element" and "The Dark Knight."
"It was work," he said. (He did have kind things to say about the film "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Francis Ford Coppola and "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" director Alfonso Cuaron.)
As the interview continued, Oldman -- who described his politics as "libertarian" -- recognized that he may have been a little too blunt.
"So this interview has gone very badly. You have to edit and cut half of what I've said, because it's going to make me sound like a bigot," he said at one point
"You're not a bigot?" replied interviewer David Hochman.
"No, but I'm defending all the wrong people," Oldman said. "I'm saying Mel's all right. Alec's a good guy. So how do I come across? Angry?"
"Passionate, certainly," Hochman said. "Readers will have to form their own opinions."
"It's dishonesty that frustrates me most," Oldman said. "I can't bear double standards. It gets under my skin more than anything."
