NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan has been off the court for years; now, he's off the market.
The sports star is getting married again, his publicist Estee R. Portnoy confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Jordan and longtime girlfriend, Yvette Prieto, got engaged on Christmas Day, CNN affiliate WCNC reported.
The couple has been seen at various high-profile public events in recent years, including the Kentucky Derby, golf outings and vacations.
Jordan led the Chicago Bulls to six championships -- two three-peats -- in the 1990s, before finishing his career with the Washington Wizards in 2003. He retired twice -- the first time to play baseball, the second time to be with his family.
Jordan and then-wife Juanita divorced in 2006 after 17 years of marriage. In 2007, Forbes Magazine listed Jordan's divorce as the costliest in celebrity history with a severance package exceeding $150 million.
Viewed widely as the world's greatest basketball player, Jordan, 48, today is a cigar-chomping golfer and socialite. In 2010, he became the first former player to be a majority owner of an NBA team, buying the Charlotte Bobcats.
Instead of a basketball wife, Prieto enters the engagement largely as a golf wife, judging from her public appearances. In 2009, during opening ceremonies for the Presidents Cup, she was seen alongside Nicki Stricker, the wife of PGA Tour star Steve Stricker, and Elin Nordegren, then-wife of Tiger Woods.
Since his hoops days, Jordan has continued lucrative endorsement deals with corporate giants such as Coca-Cola, Hanes and Nike, which houses a subsidiary with his namesake, Jordan Brand.
Jordan's name has been in the news recently. His new Air Jordans caused a shopping frenzy around Christmas. Several incidents of violence were reported near shoe stores that sold the expensive sneakers.
A wedding date for Jordan and Prieto has not been announced.
