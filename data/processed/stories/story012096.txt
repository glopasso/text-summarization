An ex-employee allegedly stabbed four former co-workers at a Toronto office building Wednesday, authorities said.
At least one employee of Ceridian, a payroll services company, was critically wounded, a police spokeswoman said.
"Out of respect for the privacy of the individual and their family, we are not able to share or comment on the specifics of the individual's condition, but all four employees are being treated by medical experts at area hospitals," a Ceridian statement said.
A suspect was taken into custody, according to Toronto Police Constable Jennifer Sidhu, who said the attacker used either scissors or a knife. The suspect was identified by police as Chuang Li, 47. He faces charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.
The attack happened on the office building's fifth floor, Sidhu said.
One of the four people hospitalized had life-threatening wounds, she said. Two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries and a third was treated and released, police said.
Police did not immediately reveal a possible motive in the attack or details about any relationship between the suspect and the victims.
"As you might imagine, this is a very difficult time," the company statement said. "The entire Ceridian family is shocked and deeply saddened by this incident."
