A shark bit a 16-year-old boy across both legs as he was surfing in Hawaii on Sunday, CNN affiliate KHON reported.
The attack came four days after a shark severed the right arm of a German tourist while she was snorkeling.
In the Sunday incident, the teen was surfing in Pohoiki Bay when an 8-foot gray shark attacked him, the affiliate reported.
He was taken to a hospital, but his condition was not known.
Authorities brought in helicopters to survey the area for sharks, but were unsuccessful.
