Paul the psychic octopus may not have predicted a medal and a soccer jersey in his future, but he now owns both.
The global phenomenon picked Spain to beat the Netherlands in the World Cup finals earlier this month.
Nearly two weeks later, a Spanish delegation from the town of Carballino brought a gift basket Thursday for the cephalopod in his hometown of Oberhausen, Germany.
The gifts included a bronze statue that is the symbol of the town of Carballino, which makes Paul an official ''best friend of the town."
The delegation -- which included Carballino's mayor Carlos Alberto Montes Marques and various businessmen -- also gave the tentacled one an official Spanish soccer jersey.
Businessman Manuel Pazo was part of the delegation. Pazo has in the past expressed his intent to buy Paul as the town's mascot.
Carballino residents will celebrate Paul again on August 8th in the 43rd "festival of the octopus."
Paul not only predicted Spain's win over the Netherlands in the final, but also the team's semifinal success against Germany.
Before that, he correctly predicted all five of Germany's earlier results, and picked Germany to beat Uruguay in the third-place playoff, ending the tournament with a remarkable eight-for-eight record.
For each prediction, two mussel-filled acrylic boxes labeled with a team's flag were lowered into Paul's tank. Whichever box he chose conveyed the winning team.
Sea Life staff, where Paul lives, have announced he is retiring from the predictions game, but previously said they were considering offers from around the globe.
Spain has expressed an interest in Paul, and a Russian bookmaking company has offered to pay 100,000 euros (about $129,800) for the octopus.
