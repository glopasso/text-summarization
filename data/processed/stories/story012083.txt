The XShot
This month CNN's Richard Quest road tested the XShot, a telescopic stainless-steel rod that allows you to take pictures and videos while keeping yourself in the frame.
A camera is screwed in position on the end of the lightweight rod which extends by three feet. The mount fits all compact machines. Once in position all you need to do is hit the camera's self-timer or remote, hold the stick out and say "cheese."
This means you no longer have to be the martyr behind the lens on holiday snaps and you can save yourself the embarrassment of having to ask an unsuspecting member of the public to take a picture of you.
Of course, you might well feel just as self-conscious dangling a camera on the end of a meter-long metal stick but at least you'll be able to trust the photographer.
Quest tested the gadget against the beautiful alpine views from Mount Stanzahorn, near to the Swiss town of Lucern. After roping in a succession of tourists to try out the XShot, he decided it was easy to operate and compact, and worthy of a thumbs up from Smart Traveller. For more details visit xshotpix.com.
