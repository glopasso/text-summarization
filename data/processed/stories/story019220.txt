Superstar Lady Gaga will have surgery to repair a tear in her hip and has canceled the rest of her "Born This Way Ball" tour, Live Nation announced Wednesday.
The singer has a labral tear of the right hip caused by strenuous repetitive movements, the tour operator said. "She will need surgery to repair the problem, followed by strict down time to recover. This unfortunately will force her to cancel the tour so she can heal," a statement said.
Gaga said Tuesday that several shows would be postponed because of an injury she had been hiding. "I've been hiding a show injury and chronic pain for sometime now, over the past month it has worsened," she tweeted Tuesday afternoon. "I've been praying it would heal."
On Tuesday, the singer described her injury as synovitis, a severe inflammation of joints.
Fans can get refunds for the canceled performances at point of purchase starting Thursday, Live Nation said.
