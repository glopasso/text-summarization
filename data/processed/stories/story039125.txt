The newest star of Robert Downey Jr.'s family also happens to be a newborn.
The 49-year-old actor and his wife, Susan, welcomed their second child together on November 4, and "Avengers" star Downey is positively giddy about his new baby girl.
"After 9 months of intensive development, Team Downey is pleased to announce our 2014 fall/winter project," Downey shared on Facebook. "Principal photography commenced 11-14 and will continue until she says, 'Dad! You are embarrassing me...I'm 30, this has gotta stop.' "
Downey is also dad to son Exton, whom he welcomed with Susan in 2012, and 21-year-old Indio, his son from a prior marriage.
They have named the newest addition to their family Avri Roel.
"Yep ... Avri Roel Downey joined the party @ 3:22 a.m. on November 4th," Downey said in his Facebook post. "She's 7lbs even, spans 20 inches, and is accompanied by a variety of Susan's traits that have seemingly overwritten my 'junk DNA.' "
To be more specific, Avri's "Pretty like mama, and (has) dimples like my uncle Jim!" Downey quipped on Twitter. He's promised he'll "post pics here + there when I'm not too busy staring ..."
The actor isn't the only celebrity who had a reason to celebrate on November 4: Kelly Rowland, too, is now a proud parent. The singer and her husband, Tim Witherspoon, welcomed a boy named Titan Jewell on Tuesday.
