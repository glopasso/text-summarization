Egyptian women called for a Million Woman March on Tuesday, International Women's Day, demanding "fair and equal opportunity for all Egyptian citizens -- beyond gender, religion or class."
"We are not after minority rights. We are not after symbolic political representation," they said in a statement on Facebook.
Women were very visible among demonstrators who toppled Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak last month, which feminists called a breakthrough for Egyptian society.
