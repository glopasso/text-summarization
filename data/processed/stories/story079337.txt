For most people life can be boiled down to a few major decisions and a list of truly memorable events.
Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams hope love conquers all in "The Time Traveler's Wife."
Typically, these are first words, first steps, graduations, births, weddings and -- of course -- marriage proposals.
More than a few of these milestone moments take place in the new romantic drama "The Time Traveler's Wife."
Of all of them, perhaps the most memorable is a scene in which Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) asks Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) to be his wife.
It's a complicated request because Henry, a kind man, also has the uncanny and often unfortunate ability to be transported suddenly and unexpectedly from one time period to another, leaving Clare on her own.
It's a peculiar set of circumstances that would give most women understandable hesitation when contemplating a marriage partner. But Clare is a woman in love, an emotion that tends to trump all others.  Watch how Bana and McAdams found humor in the scene »
Bana and McAdams sit down with CNN to discuss this scene, its comedic elements and what it means to both their characters.
