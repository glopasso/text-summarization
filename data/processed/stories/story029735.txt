Dani Pedrosa edged out world champion Casey Stoner to take pole for the French MotoGP Saturday.
Pedrosa was 0.303 seconds faster than his Honda teammate and the pair were the only two riders under the one minute 34 seconds mark at Le Mans.
Spain's Pedrosa broke his collarbone last season -- leaving him to miss several races -- but he was back to his best in a qualifying session which started in wet conditions and ended in the dry.
It was his 20th MotoGP pole and he will be looking for his 16th victory Sunday.
Italian Andrea Dovizioso was third fastest to join them on the front row on his Yamaha.
Stoner shocks MotoGP with quit decision
He relegated the works Yamaha pair of 2010 world champion Jorge Lorenzo and American Ben Spies onto the second row of the grid.
Lorenzo and Spies are separated by Britain's Cal Crutchlow, again impressing on his Yamaha.
Italian legend Valentino Rossi produced his best qualifying performance of the season for seventh for Ducati.
Rossi said this week he will continue racing for at least another season and is favored to replace Stoner when the Australian retires at the end of the season.
Stoner made the shock announcement of his intentions earlier this week. He is leading this year's title race from Lorenzo and Pedrosa.
