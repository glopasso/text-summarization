Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings are putting plans to tour and release a new album on hold this year in light of Jones' cancer diagnosis.
The soul singer said in a statement Monday that she had been diagnosed with stage 1 bile duct cancer.
"Over the last few weeks I haven't felt good and I didn't know what was going on. We sadly had to cancel shows while I went through a series of tests and short hospital stays," Jones said in the statement announcing her diagnosis. "... Luckily we caught it really early and fast and the doctors say it's operable and curable!"

Jones said she plans to have surgery soon but will need rest following the procedure. As a result, the band isn't going to release the new album, "Give the People What They Want," on August 6 as previously planned.
But Jones assures fans that she and the Dap-Kings will be back in business -- with an album release date and rescheduled tours -- as soon as she's able.
"I'll be staying in touch and keeping my fans and friends updated on my progress," Jones said. "I'm looking forward to getting back on the road to give the people what they want!"
