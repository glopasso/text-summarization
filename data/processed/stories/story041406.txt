A sixth-grade Pennsylvania teacher suspected of drunk driving allegedly struck five high school students, leaving three of them hospitalized, police in Mount Carmel Township said Thursday.
Victor Swaboski III, 38, was being held at Northumberland County Prison in lieu of $100,000 bail Thursday, following the Wednesday night incident. He has been charged with five felony counts of accidental death or personal injury, five felony counts of assault by motor vehicle while under the influence, felony flight to avoid apprehension, and five misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, police said.
He was also charged with driving under an alcohol restriction because he allegedly had two open beers with him at the time of his arrest, said police Chief Brian Hollenbush.
Swaboski's attorney couldn't be immediately located for comment.
The chief said that DUI charges are pending results from toxicology tests, to be completed within 10 days.
According to CNN affiliate WBRE, three of the teens were walking and two were on bicycles when they were hit by a Jeep Liberty as they passed in front of an elementary school about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday.
Swaboski was arrested a short distance from the crash scene, WBRE reported on its website.
Swaboski had no prior arrests on his record, the police chief said.
Student Andrew Cambell, 16, was in serious condition Thursday at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, police said.
Tyler Wondoloski, 18, and Seanna Zimmerman, 13, were listed in fair condition, the police chief said.
Two other unnamed youths were treated and released, police said.
