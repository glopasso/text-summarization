Passengers on a Delta Air Lines flight experienced an unexpected bump Sunday when the plane rolled off the runway after landing in Detroit.
Flight 753 from Las Vegas was trying to turn onto a taxiway when it slipped off the pavement, according to the Wayne County Airport Authority. It's not clear yet what caused the plane to slide off course, spokesman Scott Wintner said.
"It was like a toboggan ride down the runway, and we just couldn't make the turn at the end, and we slid off the runway into the grass," passenger Steve Maranowski told CNN affiliate WDIV.
The aircraft, carrying 153 passengers and six crew members, was pulled back onto the taxiway and towed to the gate, according to Delta spokesman Anthony Black. The plane was not damaged, and no one was injured, Black said.
Passengers spent about two and a half hours on the taxiway, Maranowski told WDIV.
"The problem was they had to wait for the salt trucks, wait for the towing company, and wait for the operations to get it out," he said.
Black said Delta and the airport will investigate to determine operating conditions at the time of the incident.
