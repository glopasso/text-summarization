Two women and a child were killed when militants blew themselves up in Pakistan's violence-hit Balochistan province Thursday, police said.
Militants in Balochistan, a province rich in natural gas, have been fighting Pakistani military forces for self-rule.
For years, they have complained that the government has paid little attention to them and their economic needs.
During recent national elections, the province bordering Afghanistan saw violent attacks on voters going to polls. Bombers struck voters who had just cast their ballots as well as candidates and their supporters, and a gunfight broke out at a polling station.
In addition to sectarian attacks on Shiites, unrest in the province in the country's southwest is believed to be fomented by several insurgent groups, including the separatist Balochistan Liberation Army and the Pakistani Taliban.
Pakistan, which has a strong militant presence near the Afghan border and other parts of the country, has been engulfed in violence.
