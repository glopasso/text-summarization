(EW.com) -- Peter and Bobby Farrelly have been quietly developing a sequel to "Dumb and Dumber" for awhile now.
Back in October, we heard that Sean Anders and John Morris -- the comedy screenwriting duo behind "Hot Tub Time Machine" and "Mr. Popper's Penguins" -- were hard at work on a script. That was the last bit of news about the project...at least until this weekend, when Peter Farrelly dropped a Twitter-imploding bombshell in the middle of a "Three Stooges" press junket.
"We're getting set to shoot Dumb and Dumber 2 in September," the director told ComingSoon.net. "We've got Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels back."
Farrelly may have jumped the gun a little bit -- a source close to the production tells EW that the film is "moving along, but it's not greenlit yet." It's hard to imagine a green light is too far away, though -- following last week's announcement about the impending arrival of "Anchorman 2," this feels like the moment for long-awaited comedy sequels. (Also: Is this a big day for Jeff Daniels, or what?)
