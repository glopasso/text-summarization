The sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect was arrested in New York City on Wednesday for allegedly making a bomb threat, police said.
Ailina Tsarnaev, 24, sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, was charged with aggravated harassment after a bomb threat was made by phone to another woman Monday.
The recipient, whose name was not released, notified police of the threat, according to New York Police Department Lt. John Grimpel.
Ailina Tsarnaev, a resident of North Bergen, New Jersey, turned herself in to authorities Wednesday.
Her boyfriend shares a child with the woman who was threatened, Grimpel said.
Alina Tsarnaev is no longer in custody and is expected to report to Manhattan criminal court on September 30, according to Grimpel.
Calls to her attorney were not immediately returned to CNN.
Her brothers were accused of planting pressure-cooker bombs at the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon that killed three people and injured more than 260. They also were accused of killing a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.
Older brother Tamerlan was killed in a police shootout, and Dzhokhar was captured in the days after the bombing. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is awaiting trial in November on terrorism charges.
