Italian Serie A outfit Juventus have completed the signing of Montenegro striker Mirko Vucinic from rivals Roma.
Vucinic, 27, had been in the Italian capital since 2005 and has signed a four-year deal with Turin-based Juve.
The former Lecce forward is Juve's fourth new arrival of the off-season, following the acquisitions of Chile's Arturo Vidal, Italy midfielder Andrea Pirlo and Switzerland duo Stephane Lichsteiner and Reto Zeigler.
The two-time European champions have also completed permanent deals for Italy quartet Fabio Quagliarella, Simone Pepe, Alessandro Matri and Marco Motta, who spent last season on loan at the Stadio Olimpico.
"I'm both excited and happy to be playing for Juventus," Vucinic told the club's official web site. "AS Roma was in my heart but it's over now. I'm very happy to be here playing for Juventus."
Juve begin the 2011-12 season with a trip to Francesco Guidolin's Udinese on August 28.
Despite losing Vucinic, Luis Enrique's Roma announced the arrival of Netherlands goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg from Ajax on Monday.
The 28-year-old, who was part of the Dutch squad which reached the final of 2010 FIFA World Cup, has also signed a four-year contract.
Stekelenburg made 191 appearances for Ajax after making his debut in 2002 and has 40 caps for Bert van Markwijk's national side.
Elsewhere, Barcelona's Jeffren Suarez will hold talks with Sporting Lisbon over a move to the Portuguese club.
Jeffren was part of Spain's under-21 squad which recently won the European Championships and has left Barca's tour of the U.S. to discuss the transfer.
The 23-year-old made eight appearances for the Spanish champions last season and scored one goal -- in Barca's 5-0 thrashing of arch rivals Real Madrid in November.
