U.S. ski queen Lindsey Vonn damaged the same knee that underwent major surgery in February when she crashed Tuesday on a training run at Copper Mountain in Colorado.
Following the incident, she was not admitted to the hospital but underwent "further evaluation, as is typical after a crash," according to a statement from the U.S. Ski Team.
On Wednesday, Vonn's spokesperson Lewis Kay revealed that the Olympic downhill champion had damaged the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in her troublesome right knee during the fall.
"Lindsey sustained a mild strain to her right knee, a partial tear to her right ACL, minor facial abrasions and scapular contusions from her fall," Kay said in a statement.
"She needs to rest for a few days and then will pursue aggressive physical therapy and will determine the next time she is able to compete after seeing how she responds to the treatment.
"We will provide a further update when new information becomes available."
The news comes as a significant blow to Vonn, who was preparing to return to competitive racing after her serious knee injury earlier this year.
Vonn was airlifted to a hospital in February after she landed heavily on her right knee on the opening day of the Alpine Ski World Championships in Austria. She underwent surgery for knee reconstruction.

Vonn was crowned America's snow queen when she became the first American woman to win the Olympic downhill title at the Vancouver Games in 2010.
She followed up her Vancouver victory with a stellar World Cup season in 2011-2012, winning 12 races and the overall title with a new record points haul.
A combination of illness and injury disrupted Vonn's dominance on the slopes last season. She planned to return at the World Cup event in Beaver Creek, Colorado on November 29.
