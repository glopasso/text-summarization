The heady days of James Bond are but a distant memory and, the sad fact is amphibious cars are just not that cool anymore.
On land, on water, under the water: The Rinspeed sQuba will go anywhere you want and it is entirely emissions-free.
But a new fully submersible car inspired by Bond and updated for the new millennium could breathe fresh life into the sub-aqua sports car.
The Rinspeed sQuba is a fully submersible car designed by Swiss car designer Frank M Rinderknecht.
Inspired by James Bond's submersible Lotus Esprit in the 1977 movie "The Spy Who Loved Me," the car drives on land, on water -- and under the water to a depth of ten meters.
Released as a prototype last year, the car is carbon neutral, entirely emissions-free and boasts electric motors and water jets to allow the driver to control the vehicle under the water.

The sQuba also has a compressed air tank which allows the occupants to breathe under water and all of the body work is water-tight and water-resistant.
Rinderknecht, the chief executive of Rinspeed, told CNN that no further units of the car have been produced -- but commercial production was not out of the question.
"Since the sQuba was perceived as a prototype, the manufacturing has not been explored. However, we are open for anyone to take up the project to serial production," he said.
