(CNN)  -- Defending champion Jelena Jankovic will face fellow Serbian player Ana Ivanovic in the last 16 at Indian Wells, after both eased through the third round.
World No. 6 Jankovic defeated 32nd-ranked Julia Goerges of Germany 6-2 6-4 on Sunday, while 19th-ranked Ivanovic eased past Czech Barbora Zahlavova Strycova 6-2 6-2.
When they meet in Tuesday's fourth round, it will be the 10th time the two former world No. 1's have played each other on the WTA Tour.
The 23-year-old Ivanovic -- winner at Indian Wells in 2008 -- leads the head to head 6-3, but Jankovic has claimed victory in their last two meetings.
"I just want to continue to play my tennis and really focus on my game and not really worry about my opponent who is across other side of the net," 26-year-old Jankovic told the official WTA Tour website.
"It's gonna be another match, and I just want to play. I want to enjoy my tennis like I've been doing."
World No. 2 Kim Clijsters was knocked out of the tournament in the third round in 2010, and almost suffered the same feat this year as she dropped the second set to Italy's Sara Errani.
After throwing away four consecutive service games to allow the world No. 40 to level the game at one set all, the Belgian bounced back in the decider to win 6-3 2-6 6-4.
"I was still able to win without being close to coming to my best level," Clijsters said. "That's the positive thing. I also know that for my next match everything will have to be a lot better."
The Australian Open champion will face 15th-ranked Marion Bartoli of France for a place in the last eight, after the former Wimbledon finalist defeated Andrea Petkovic of Germany 6-4 6-2.
Reigning French Open champion and world No. 5 Francesca Schiavone was not troubled in her 6-2 6-3 win over French qualifier Alize Cornet and will next play Israel's Shahar Peer, after the world no. 12 battled past Russia's Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 2-6 6-3 7-5.
However, world No. 3 and 2010 Wimbledon and U.S. Open finalist Vera Zvonareva did not make the fourth round, after the Russian was beaten by Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia 5-7 7-6 (4) 6-4.
