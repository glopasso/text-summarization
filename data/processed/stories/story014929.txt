Barcelona's recent defensive problems have increased further with the news that French international Eric Abidal faces up to two months out of action because of an injury to his left leg.
Abidal collected an abductor muscle problem in training, meaning he joins fellow-defenders Rafael Marquez, Dani Alves, Gerard Pique and midfielder Yaya Toure on the sidelines for the Primera Liga trip to Atletico Madrid this weekend.
Barcelona confirmed the news on their official Web site, with a statement adding: "After medical tests, which were carried out in Barcelona, the medical team confirmed that Abidal was suffering a disinsertion of the adductor in his left leg."
As well as Saturday's match, Abidal will be absent from both legs of the Champions League last 16 showdown against Stuttgart, while he will also miss a host of key Spanish league fixtures.
Marquez and Pique are banned this weekend after their recent dismissals against Getafe, while Alves is suffering from a calf injury.
Toure is sometimes deployed by Barca coach Pep Guardiola as an emergency defender, but the Ivory Coast international has a leg injury which will rule him out of action for two weeks.
