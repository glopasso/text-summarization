Think your Facebook status updates are pretty dramatic? If you act soon, you may entice a troupe of improv artists to stage them for the world.
"Stuff Theater," happening live until 9 a.m. Thursday, is taking the magical, mundane and sometimes mystifying world of Facebook posts to the stage in a 24-hour performance.
Sponsored by online security company Norton, the experimental project lets Facebook users volunteer their profiles. If selected, a post from their page will be acted out during the event, which began Wednesday morning at a Chicago theater and is streaming live on Norton's Facebook page.
So, for example, this post -- "Just bought a tent. Wilderness here I come." -- ends up featuring a Davy Crockett look-alike dancing as a gospel choir belts out those words, with feeling.
A dance troupe interprets a photo of chicken wings on a grill. And an opera singer renders "Is it just me, or does Chicago smell like grape soda tonight?" like Pavarotti.
"We believe it's truly an experimental way to capture people's attention in a relevant way," said Sally Jenkins, Norton's vice president of worldwide consumer marketing.
The name of the project is a play on the name of a Norton advertising campaign, "Stuff." Actors (from improv to Shakespearean), singers, musicians, poets, sculptors, puppeteers and balloon artists all have been among those taking the stage so far.
As of 3 p.m. ET, 150 live skits had been performed at Chicago's Copernicus Theater. Tapping into the city's rich improv-comedy tradition, performers draw a post and have only a few moments to decide what they'll do onstage.
"The performers are doing it on the fly," Jenkins said. They were hoping to work in 1,000 skits by Thursday morning.
The folks watching and commenting on Norton's page seemed amused.
"This is strangely, strangely addicting," one user wrote.
"This is awesome. Ridiculous, silly, and just awesome," said another. The page had more than 170,000 likes as of late Wednesday afternoon.
