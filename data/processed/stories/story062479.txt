(CNN)Amy Schumer seems to be trying single-handedly this week to make everyone in America laugh. And she's off to a good start.
The comedian took a fake tumble on the red carpet Tuesday night at the 2015 TIME 100 gala in New York -- right in front of fellow honorees Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, who stepped around her as they moved down the line.
The stunt drew guffaws from the paparazzi and other onlookers, although Kanye -- perhaps not used to being upstaged -- looked unamused.
"I saw them, and I asked my publicist, 'Can I dive in front of them and act like I fell?' And she said, 'I can't stop you,' " Schumer told People.
The prank came the same night the third season of Schumer's hit show, "Inside Amy Schumer," premiered on Comedy Central. The episode has won praise for its "Milk Milk Lemonade" video, which ridicules mens' obsession with a certain female body part, and a "Friday Night Lights" parody in which high school football players protest their new coach's "no raping" policy.
And it came the night after Schumer appeared on CBS' "The Late Show" and turned David Letterman red-faced when she lifted her dress to show him a scar she got from surfing and said, "That's my vagina."
Letterman, who had urged her to "do something now that you'll regret," turned to the chortling audience and said, "Well, I asked for it, didn't I?"
So yes, you can say Schumer -- who in the past two weeks has graced the cover of Entertainment Weekly, hosted the MTV Movie Awards and learned her TV show was just renewed for a fourth season -- is having a moment.
"They were right there! The epicenter of American (celebrity culture.) Gotta do it," Schumer told People about her Kimye red carpet dive. "It was the best."
