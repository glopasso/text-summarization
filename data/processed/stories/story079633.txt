(CNN)You'll see some familiar faces in the Final Four.
Duke beat Gonzaga 66-52 on Sunday, giving Blue Devils' coach Mike Krzyzewski his 12th trip to the semifinals of the NCAA men's basketball tournament.
Justise Winslow and Matt Jones each scored 16 to help Duke win the South Region. Gonzaga, led by 16 points from Kyle Wiltjer, was hoping to earn its first trip to the Final Four.
Here's how the Final Four, to be played in Indianapolis, has shaped up:
Next Saturday, Duke will face Michigan State in the first semifinal. In the next game, top seed Kentucky will battle Wisconsin.
The winners will meet on Monday, April 6, for the national championship.
One other tournament game was played Sunday. Michigan State overcame Louisville 76-70 in overtime to win the East Region.
The victory was sweet vindication for the Spartans, who had an up-and-down season and came into the East Region as a No. 7 seed. This will be the seventh Final Four for coach Tom Izzo, who led Michigan State to the national title in 2000.
Krzyzewski has won four national championships at Duke, which was the top seed in the South Region.
