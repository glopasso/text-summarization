The pitch is back and fans can't aca-believe it.
The trailer for musical comedy "Pitch Perfect 2" hit theaters and the Internet this week, promising more harmonizing from our favorite college a cappella group.
Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow and the rest of the Barden Bellas will return for the sequel to the 2012 hit comedy.
The trailer shows that they can still carry a tune with a new rendition of "Cups," the song Beca Mitchell (Kendrick) used to audition for Barden that became a viral video sensation.
Due out May 2015, the film centers on the Barden Bellas heading to the A Cappella World Championships, which no American team has ever won "because the whole world hates us."
The trailer also shows Wilson reprising her breakthrough role as the mischievous "Fat Amy," who is still confusing suitors with a sly wink that means "no." Elizabeth Banks steps behind the camera as director in addition to returning to her role as enthusiastic commentator Gail Abernathy-McKadden.
