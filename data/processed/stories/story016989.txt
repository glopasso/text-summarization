(CNN)According to Selena Gomez, life in the spotlight isn't all it's cracked up to be.
The 22-year-old actress and singer appears topless and in a pair of short shorts on the cover of the spring issue of V magazine, proving that she's moved on from her days as a Disney child star.
The Huffington Post reports that Gomez discusses in the accompanying interview the anxiety that fame has brought into her life.
Things got really bad, she said, with all the tabloid scrutiny over her relationship with pop star Justin Bieber.
"There were a few months where I was a little depressed, where I wouldn't leave (the house) as much," Gomez said. "I think I drove myself crazy for a little bit. It was just easier to say, 'Hey, do you mind running to the grocery store and picking some stuff up, I don't want to get photographed.' "
The "Spring Breakers" star said she's grown since being involved with Bieber. The pair were involved in an on-again, off-again relationship from 2011 to 2014.
"I was 18 years old, and it was my first love," she said. "The older I get, I'm guarding certain things more."
Gomez said she's also learning to cope better with the fame.
"I'm finally getting a little bit more comfortable," she said. "It's a process."
