Pamela Anderson's career to date may have been more Playboy than pit lane, but the former Baywatch star has decided to dip her feet into motorsport by launching her own racing team.
The 44-year-old actress and ex-cover girl is fronting the Downforce1 team, which will compete in the 2012 European Le Mans and International GT Open series.
Anderson, more famous for sporting a red bathing suit as C.J. Parker in the hit '90s TV show than racing overalls, launched the venture earlier this month with the aim of competing in the 2013 open-wheel NASCAR series in the U.S.
"Fast cars and fast women go together," the former Playmate of the Month said on the team's website. "Here we are surrounded by men, I love it."
The Canadian is described as a fan of motorsport divisions "from NASCAR to Formula One" and hailed the venture as "a dream come true."
"I'm so proud of the Downforce 1 team," she said. "These gentleman have achieved the impossible and built up a team in just four months.
"I cannot wait to see my cars on the race track, it's hard to believe until I see it."
But Anderson's dream has been temporarily derailed. The team's sole driver Markus Fux, who also doubles up as Downforce1's marketing coordinator, announced they will miss this weekend's International GT race in France.
"Due to technical issues and circumstances beyond the control of the team, the management of Downforce1 have reluctantly decided, in the interest of the team and its sponsors, not to attend the first race at Paul Ricard," read the statement.
"The team now intends to begin its 2012 race program at the GT Open Series round at Portimao on the 28th April. The team apologizes to its many fans and supporters."
Anderson is not the first female celebrity to be drawn to the track. Socialite Paris Hilton, heiress to the Hilton hotel fortune, co-founded the SuperMartxe VIP MotoGP team in December 2010.
