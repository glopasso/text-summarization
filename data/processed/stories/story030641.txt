With the third season of "Games of Thrones" under way on HBO, series star Kit Harington opens up to Glamour magazine about what to expect from his character, Jon Snow.
Snow, the bastard son of Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark, is just getting to know Ygritte, played by former "Downton Abbey" actress Rose Leslie.
When Glamour asked Harington how his tumultuous relationship with the redheaded Free Folk might be different in real life, he said, "I think they'd be exactly the same."
"She'd still be taking the piss out of Jon, and Jon would still be getting angry about it. And secretly quite enjoying it," he said.
Speaking of women in real life, Harington said he's most attracted to funny women who understand his sense of humor.
"I like a girl who does not take me seriously, you know?" he said. "It's important to be able to laugh at each other. And I like a girl who eats. I much prefer that she order the burger."
