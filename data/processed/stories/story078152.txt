Kanye West faces charges of battery and attempted theft in an altercation with a photographer at Los Angeles International Airport, the city attorney's office said Friday.
On July 19, a man flagged down police and said he was taking photos of an "individual" -- as airport police described the suspect in a report at the time -- when the suspect attacked him.
The photographer was taken to a hospital, but his injuries were not specified, airport police said at the time.
A representative for West did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Rob Wilcox, spokesman for the city attorney's office, said each of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail.
Arraignment is scheduled for October 10.
The rapper is scheduled to start a North American tour to promote his new album, "Yeezus," in Seattle on October 19.
