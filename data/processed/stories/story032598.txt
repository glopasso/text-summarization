The mother-in-law of a 25-year-old woman found dead in a septic system provided investigators with details where the corpse was located, police said Wednesday.
The mother-in-law, Sandra Inman, along with the woman's estranged husband, William Inman Jr., and the woman's father-in-law, William Inman Sr., were arrested and face kidnapping charges.
Logan, Ohio Police Chief Aaron Miller said the body of Summer Inman was discovered in a septic system behind a church in nearby Nelsonville, Ohio on Tuesday.
He said officers had to unscrew the system's cover before reaching the body.
"It would appear that she was killed very quickly," Miller told reporters. He did not provide further details.
Summer Inman's abduction and the arrests connected to her case have made national news recently.
The mother of three was working as part of a cleaning crew at a local bank on March 22, police said. When she stepped outside, she was grabbed and forced into a white vehicle.
Miller said that the evidence suggests all three suspects played a role in the kidnapping, but he would not discuss whether they were involved in the apparent murder.
Summer Inman and William Inman Jr. were married in 2004 but the couple was separated, CNN affiliate WBNS reported.
Summer Inman had also filed for divorce and claimed in court documents that her husband had threatened to kill her if she took his children away, the affiliate reported.
