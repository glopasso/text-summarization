Singer Bobby Brown pleaded no contest Wednesday to driving with a blood alcohol content of .08% or higher and was sentenced to 36 months of probation, his attorney said.
The charge to which he pleaded no contest is a violation of the California vehicle code, the attorney said.
In Los Angeles County Superior Court, prosecutors dismissed two other counts against him -- a drunk driving charge and a suspended driver's license charge -- said Brown lawyer Tiffany Feder.
Brown was also sentenced to one day in jail -- which he already served -- and must undergo a 90-day alcohol treatment program, Feder said.
Brown didn't appear in court, Feder said.
Brown, 43, showed signs of intoxication and failed a field sobriety test during the traffic stop last month in the Reseda area of Los Angeles County, California, Highway Patrol spokeswoman Tiana Reed said.
Brown is the ex-husband of the late singer Whitney Houston.
