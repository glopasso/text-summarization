The rapid sweep of Islamic militants from Syria into northern Iraq has sent the Middle East into crisis, caused alarm in capitals from Tehran to Washington and forced about half a million people to flee their homes.
The flood of Iraqis trying to escape ISIS fighters doubled the country's displaced population almost overnight. More than 1.1 million people -- nearly one out of 30 -- in Iraq are now displaced.
