The hotel where Jay Z had an alleged altercation with Beyonce's sister says it has fired the person who leaked the tape to the media.
"The Standard has identified the individual responsible for breaching the security policies of the hotel and recording the confidential CCTV video released by TMZ," said Brian Phillips, a spokesman for the hotel.
"The Standard has already terminated the individual and will now be pursuing all available civil and criminal remedies."
In the statement, Phillips said the hotel will turn over its information to authorities.
TMZ says the surveillance video is from an elevator and was taken the night of the Met Gala this month in New York.
In the video, a woman who resembles Solange Knowles enters just before a man who appears to be the rapper. They appear to exchange words before the woman lunges forward and starts striking him. Another unidentified man grabs and holds her.
A woman who resembles Beyonce stands in the corner of the elevator during most of the altercation. Jay Z is Beyonce's husband and Solange's brother-in-law.
It's unclear what caused the fight.
Representatives for Solange, Jay Z and Beyonce have not responded to CNN requests for comment.
Shortly after the video was released, the hotel said it was "shocked and disappointed" by the breach of security.
"We are investigating with the utmost urgency the circumstances surrounding the situation and, as is our customary practice, will discipline and prosecute the individuals involved to our fullest capacity," it said this week.
Beyonce and Jay Z recently announced their "On the Run" tour, which is scheduled to take them to 16 cities this summer.
