A New Jersey judge Monday ordered $338 million Powerball jackpot winner Pedro Quezada to pay $30,000 in back child support to the mother of three of his children.
The payment clears Quezada's record, probation officials said during a hearing in Paterson. Quezada told the judge that the children will now live with him.
Family Court Judge Ernest Caposela warned Quezada -- who is expected to net approximately $152 million after taxes -- that he'll be approached with lots of investment offers, but the best investment would be in his children.
