Meg Ryan and John Mellencamp have ended their relationship after three years of dating, a report says.
The two split "a couple of weeks ago," one of Mellencamp's friends told Closer Weekly, which was the first to report the news.
The pair had kept their relationship relatively quiet. The couple began going out sometime in late 2010, according to People magazine, after Mellencamp separated from his wife of 18 years, Elaine Irwin Mellencamp.
Ryan, 52, and Mellencamp, 62, kept time on both the East Coast and in Mellencamp's longtime home of Indiana.
"It was the distance," a source told People of the split. "She lives in New York and he resides in Indiana. It was the long distance that ultimately was the cause."
Mellencamp's friend had a different take.
"I don't think he loved all the attention he got just from dating an actress," the friend told Closer Weekly. "I bet he'll stay away from dating another famous person for a while."
Ryan, who hasn't appeared in a movie since 2009's "Serious Moonlight," is currently directing "Ithaca," a version of William Saroyan's novel "The Human Comedy."
Mellencamp's new album, "Plain Spoken," is due for release next month.
