We cover a lot of ground today on CNN Student News, from a train derailment in California to a presidential veto in Washington to the Pacific island location of an iconic photograph. We take a look at wages in the U.S. job market and a non-lethal heat ray in the arsenal of the U.S. military. And we feature a Character Study of a woman who stops at nothing to help her community.
On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
