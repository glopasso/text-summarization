The father of a 15-month-old boy who died after being left in a car in July has been charged with criminally negligent homicide, according to police in Connecticut.
Kyle Seitz, 36, turned himself in at Ridgefield police headquarters on Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement from Capt. Jeff Kreitz.
After being processed, Seitz was released on a written promise to appear in Danbury Superior Court on Wednesday morning, Kreitz said.
The death of Benjamin Seitz was ruled a homicide in August.
On July 7, Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN in July.
Seitz drove to work and at the end of the day he went to pick Benjamin up at day care, only to realize he was not there, authorities said.
When Seitz realized his son was in the car, he rushed the child to the hospital, but Benjamin had died.
The cause of the boy's death was hyperthermia due to environmental exposure, according to the state medical examiner.
Neither Seitz nor his attorney immediately responded immediately to CNN's requests for comment Tuesday.

The Connecticut death came a month after a similar incident in suburban Atlanta garnered national headlines.
In the latter instance, a grand jury ended up indicting Justin Ross Harris on eight counts, including malice murder and two counts of felony murder, over the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper. Through his attorneys, Harris has claimed that he forgot to drop off the boy at daycare and mistakenly left him in his 2011 Hyundai Tucson on a day when the temperature topped 92 degrees.
At least 44 children died in 2013 from heatstroke caused by being left in cars in the United States, according to the national nonprofit organization KidsAndCars.org. At least 30 children have died this year for the same reason. Over the past decade, the group figures, there have been at least 388 children who have died of vehicular heatstroke.
