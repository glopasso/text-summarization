AT&T is joining the expanding field of home security and automation, introducing a wireless service that will let homeowners use their mobile devices to remotely set alarms, turn on lights or even shut off water.
Called AT&T Digital Life, the service will connect users with a vast array of domestic devices and appliances, including cameras, door locks, smoke and carbon monoxide detectors and thermostats.
It will run on AT&T's IP-based wireless platform and can be accessed via smartphones, tablets or PCs. And despite being from AT&T, it will work regardless of the user's wireless carrier.
The company plans to begin trials of the service in Atlanta and Dallas this summer.
"AT&T Digital Life will change the way people live, work and play -- and meets a clear need in the market," said Kevin Petersen, senior vice president of Digital Life for AT&T Mobility. "The service is smart, simple and customer-centric -- freeing homeowners to do the things they want to do without compromising on the things they need to do to care for family and home."
Digital Life joins other existing products and wireless companies that are taking advantage of people's increasing reliance on mobile devices.
Comcast offers a home-security feature through an iPhone app. Verizon offers a similar service, while home security market leader ADT features ADT Pulse on approved devices.
In a news release from AT&T, Larry Hettick, a research director for market-research company Current Analysis, says that Digital Life "promises to be as robust as anything in the marketplace today." He said he was impressed with the system's wireless platform and ability, unlike some existing services, to work with a wide range of different devices.
