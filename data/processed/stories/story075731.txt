Two separate wrong-way wrecks killed 11 people early Sunday morning in Florida and California, officials said.
Five people died in a crash on Interstate 275 in Tampa when a Ford Expedition, traveling south in the northbound lanes, collided head-on with a Hyundai, said Sgt. Steve Gaskins with the Florida Highway Patrol.
Gaskins said the Expedition caught fire, and its driver was killed. The other four other people killed, all men ages 20 and 21, were occupants in the Hyundai, he said.
In Pomona, California, a wrong-way driver crashed into two other vehicles on State Route 60, known locally as 60 Freeway, leaving six dead, according to California Highway Patrol Officer Jennifer Cassidy.
KABC, a CNN affiliate, reported that the first driver was arrested on suspicion of DUI and manslaughter. Cassidy said the driver was hospitalized in critical condition.
Cassidy said four people died at the scene and two others died at the hospital.
