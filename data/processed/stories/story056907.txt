LONDON, England -- Tottenham have completed the signing of Germany Under-21 midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng from Hertha Berlin for a fee in the region of £5.4 million ($10.8 million).
Midfielder Boateng, 20, was voted Germany's best young player in 2006.
Boateng, 20, was voted Germany's best young player in 2006 and made 43 appearances for Bundesliga club Hertha.
"In Germany he is regarded as one of the biggest talents, we recognised this and went in for him," said Tottenham manager Martin Jol.
"You could compare him with the likes of Aaron Lennon and Tom Huddlestone in that he is an exciting player for now and the future. He is an attacking midfield player, very strong and that is one of his main assets."
Spurs saw off competition from Sevilla to make Boateng their seventh summer signing.
"It has been my ambition to play in England, I am 20 now and am about to quickly realise my dream," said Boateng.
"I know that Tottenham are a team who like to play offensive football. The club want to climb higher next season and I want to be a part of it.
"I watched the Premier League regularly in Germany, it is the most famous league in the world and I have always enjoyed it." E-mail to a friend
