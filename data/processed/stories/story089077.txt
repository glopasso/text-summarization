New York Jets running back Mike Goodson was arrested on drug and gun charges in New Jersey early Friday morning, New Jersey State Police said.
According to the NFL, Goodson, from Spring, Texas, signed a three-year, $6.9 million contract with the Jets this offseason.
A tow truck driver called police at 3:15 a.m. Friday when he saw a vehicle stopped in the left lane on the westbound side of Interstate 80 in Denville, police said. Goodson, 25, was the passenger in the GMC Yukon. Police found a loaded handgun, hollow-point ammunition, drug paraphernalia and a small amount of marijuana in the vehicle, said Lt. Stephen Jones, a state police spokesman.
Goodson appeared to be intoxicated, Jones said, and was taken to St. Clare's Hospital in Boonton Township, where he was evaluated and treated. He was sent to state police custody upon his release, Jones said.
The driver, Garant Evans of Roselle, was arrested at the scene and faces the same charges, in addition to a DWI allegation and motor vehicle tickets. Evans, 31, was a convicted felon before Friday's arrest, Jones said.
Jones said Goodson and Evans are being held on full-cash bail at the Morris County Jail. Goodson's bail was set at $50,000, and Evans' was set at $150,000.
