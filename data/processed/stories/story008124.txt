(CNN)Call it "The War of the Rose."
Amber Rose and Khloe Kardashian had it out on social media Monday, and it was something to behold.
It all appears to have started when model Rose appeared on New York's Power 105.1 morning show and was asked about a reported relationship between reality star Kardashian's younger sister Kylie Jenner and rapper Tyga.
Rose, who is the ex-girlfriend of Kardashian's now-brother-in-law Kanye West, said she believes Jenner, 17, is too young for the 25-year-old rapper.
"She's a baby. She needs to go to bed at 7 o'clock and relax," said Rose, who is also good friends with the mother of Tyga's infant son. "That's ridiculous. (Tyga) should be ashamed of himself."
Rose added that while she doesn't respect the Kardashian/Jenner clan, she doesn't hate them, either.
Kardashian then took to Twitter to point out that Rose said during the interview that she started stripping at the age of 15 and to request that Rose stop talking about her family.
That's when Rose unleashed the shade by pointing out that although she may have stripped, West's wife, Kim Kardashian, is well-known for having a sex tape. She also showed the clan what can happen when you mess with a  girl from South Philly.
Kardashian then spoke out to say that Rose's response just proved her point.
But Rose had the last word, posting a screen shot of what appeared to be Kardashian liking a post of a leaked nude photo of Rose. Rose captioned it "Yo @khloekardashian I'm really happy for u and I'm gonna let u finish but I have the best leaked nude pics of all time! #StopSweatinMeHoe."
