"It's like watching incredible shoals of fish in the Maldives just move together. There's an organic feeling in how the orchestra wants to play, and it's like a type of breathing," Sir Simon Rattle.

The 300-strong Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, under Sir Simon Rattle's leadership, is dedicated to making classical music accessible to everyone.
