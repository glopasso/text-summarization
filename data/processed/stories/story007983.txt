The head of a television station and a human rights activist were shot dead by gunmen who attacked their car with small arms fire Friday, Iraq's interior ministry said.
Taha Hameed, the director of al-Massar TV, and Abed Farhan Thiyab, the director of Iraq's political prisoners association, were killed in southern Baghdad.
Hameed was also a senior official with the governing Islamic Dawa Party - Iraq Organization.
He was killed immediately when gunmen intercepted his car and fired on it, interior ministry officials said.
Separately, two civilians were killed and four others were wounded when a roadside bomb exploded in a residential area in the northern outskirts of Baghdad on Thursday night.
