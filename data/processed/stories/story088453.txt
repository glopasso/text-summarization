(CNN)New York City has gone 11 days without a homicide, its longest stretch without any on modern record, the New York Police Department said Friday.
The record was broken midnight Thursday. It was the 11th full day without a reported homicide.
The last reported homicide was February 1, or Super Bowl Sunday, in Upper Manhattan, a police representative said Friday.
Police then responded to a 911 call about multiple shots being fired and found five individuals with gunshot wounds, New York police said. One of those five, Graham Shadale, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene.
The streak has been the longest since the New York Police Department began recording statistics with a computerized program called Compstat in 1994, the police representative said.
Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hushed talk of the streak Friday on "CBS This Morning."
"Shh ... we don't want to jinx it," Bratton told host Charlie Rose. "We're into our 12th day now, Charlie. Eleven is a record and let's keep it going."
Despite the record-breaking streak, there has been an uptick of shooting incidents compared with the same time period last year.
The week between February 1 and February 8 experienced 110 shooting incidents in 2015 versus 91 in 2014, according to Detective Cheryl Crispin of the  New York Police Department's Public Information office.
CNN's Michael Martinez and Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.
