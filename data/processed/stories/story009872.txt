The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of betting allegations in London left the United Kingdom on Friday.
All three were interviewed by police last week under caution, meaning police believed they may have committed a crime. The players have promised to return to help investigators "in due course," London's Metropolitan Police said.
The players departed London's Heathrow airport at about 11:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m. ET).
The betting scandal has rocked the cricket world, with allegations that members of the Pakistan national team were involved in "spot-fixing" during Pakistan's Test series with England late last month.
Spot-fixing involves deliberately throwing parts of a game, rather than the whole match.
The News of the World, the British tabloid that first reported the allegations, said players deliberately bowled "no balls," or fouls, at specific points in the game and that the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds (about $230,000) in the scam.
No players have been arrested over the allegations, but the three questioned by police -- teenage cricket star Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif, and team captain Salman Butt -- were provisionally suspended by the sport's governing body and charged with various offenses under the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption code.
Their team is continuing a two-month tour of England without them.
