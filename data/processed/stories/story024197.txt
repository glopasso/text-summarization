Garrison Keillor, author and host of the folksy radio show "A Prairie Home Companion," was being treated Wednesday for a minor stroke he suffered over the weekend, a hospital spokesman said.
Author Garrison Keillor attends an event in New York on November 18, 2008.
Keillor, who turned 67 last month, was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on Sunday night, spokesman Karl Oestreich said in a news release.
"He is up and moving around, speaking sensibly, working at a laptop, and it's expected he'll be released on Friday," Oestreich said.
"He plans to resume a normal schedule next week."
The live variety show "A Prairie Home Companion" is aired on Minnesota Public Radio.
Keillor launched the program on July 6, 1974, in a St. Paul, Minnesota, college theater before an audience of 12 people.
According to a "Backstage Chat" on the show, Keillor got the idea for it from watching the Grand Ole Opry.
Keillor, also a storyteller and satirist, has written 11 books, including three for children. He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1994.
