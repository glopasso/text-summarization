A 21-year-old man in Chicago is charged with battery after allegedly binding his toddler's wrists, ankles and mouth with tape and posting a photo online.
Above the photo of the girl, which Andre Curry allegedly put on his Facebook page, were the words, "This is wut happens wen my baby hits me back. ;)"
The Facebook page appears to have been taken down. But the image was picked up by other websites. The Cook County State's Attorney's Office also told CNN that the caption was with the photo on Curry's Facebook page.
Andy Conklin, a spokesman for the state's attorney's office, said the girl is 22 months old.
A public defender for Curry did not immediately return a call from CNN on Wednesday.
Curry is charged with aggravated domestic battery, Chicago police said. He appeared in court Wednesday, where bond was set at $100,000, the state's attorney's office said.
Conklin said the next court date will be December 27.
The photo at issue shows the girl with painter's tape over her mouth and binding her wrists and ankles.
