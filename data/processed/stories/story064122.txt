(PEOPLE.com) -- No stranger to performing, Pink is honing her acting chops to star as free-spirited sex addict Dede in "Thanks for Sharing."
Pink (real name Alicia Moore), 32, did have a cameo in "Charlie's Angels Full Throttle" in 2003 and another small role in "Catacombs" in 2007, but this is the singer's first leading role.
Spotted filming in New York City's West Village Tuesday, she is set to star alongside such pros as Gwenyth Paltrow, Mark Ruffalo and Tim Robbins. Her character shares a bond with "Book of Mormon"'s Josh Gad, who, as Neil, is another of three characters undergoing 12-step treatment for sex addiction.
"[Pink] could not be a more ideal fit for this role," writer-director Stuart Blumberg said in a statement. "She carries with her just the right combination of heart and edginess for the part of Dede, and we're incredibly excited to share her acting talent with audiences."
Thank goodness she also looks great in leather!
