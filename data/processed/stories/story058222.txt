Another Paris Fashion Week has come to an end with a bang.
Over the past week, CNN brought you all the action from behind the scenes and in the spotlight -- from head-turning looks on the catwalk, glamorous models and breathtaking set design, to the omnipresent Kardashians hitting up the town in force and uber-fashionista Carine Roitfeld's exclusive party.
If you missed out, never fear.
With a little help from Bryanboy, Chiara Ferragni and FaceHunter who are part of a new blogging elite redefining the rules of fashion -- we bring you an Instagram roundup of the hottest looks, people and parties.
