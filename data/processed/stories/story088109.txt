Newly-promoted Atalanta will start the Italian Serie A season with a six-point deduction for their part in an alleged match-fixing scandal.
The club's 38-year-old captain Cristiano Doni has also been banned for three-and-half years by the Italian Football Federation, which could effectively end his career.
Doni's teammate, Thomas Manfredini, received a three-year ban while former Italy international Giuseppe Signori was suspended for five years.
Eight more clubs were also punished by the disciplinary committee, including Ascoli, in the second division, who were also docked six points.
Third tier club Ravenna were expelled from the league and Alessandria have been relegated.
Benevento had nine points deducted, Cremonese six, Piacenza four and Reggiana. Spezia and Taranta were penalized a point each.
Atalanta said in a statement on their official web site they were "deeply disappointed" and intended to appeal the decision.
Marco Paoloni, a former goalkeeper for Cremonese and Benevento, was at the center of the allegations and has been handed a ban of five years.
A total of 16 players and 16 clubs have been punished in some form.
