George H. W. Bush was the 41st president. But to younger generations, he may be more recognizable as the father of George W. Bush, the 43rd president. The elder Bush is also the father of Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a possible contender for the White House in 2016, and the grandfather of George P. Bush, an aspiring Latino politician in Texas.
His family aside, George H.W. Bush's presidency was marked by the first Gulf War and a sluggish economy. Bush also served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president and is a former CIA director.
Among the little known facts about the former president: "Well, I like a colorful sock. I'm a sock man," Bush told his granddaughter the Today Show's Jenna Bush Hager in a sit-down interview on his 88th birthday.
