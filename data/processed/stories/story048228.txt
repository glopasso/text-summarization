Want to highlight your wedding pictures or the first snapshots of your newborn on Facebook to make sure friends don't miss the big news?
The social network announced on Wednesday that users in the U.S. will be able to promote their personal posts to friends for a fee, starting today.
Although testing first started in New Zealand in May and has since rolled out to more than 20 countries, the feature is now available in the U.S. for the first time. The price to promote your news and updates? About $7, according to The Verge.
Businesses are already able to promote their posts and get updates in front of more eyes for a fee, but personal updates still reach only a limited amount of friends on the site. Investing in a promoted post will increase the chance of someone seeing your post at the top of their news feed, the company said.

"Sometimes a particular friend might not notice your post, especially if a lot of their friends have been posting recently and your story isn't near the top of their feed," Facebook said in a blog post. "When you promote a post -- whether it's wedding photos, a garage sale, or big news -- you bump it higher in news feed so your friends and subscribers are more likely to notice it."
The option may also be of use to people looking to promote bands, parties and other events.
