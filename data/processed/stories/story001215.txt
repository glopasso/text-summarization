A 19-year-old Detroit woman who was shot and killed on the front porch of a home was not shot at close range, according to an autopsy report.
Police have said that the homeowner's shotgun accidentally discharged, shooting Renisha McBride in the face. Lawyers for McBride say she was simply looking for help after a car crash, while those representing the homeowner say the 54-year-old was justified in his actions.
As reported by the Detroit News, McBride's autopsy left many questions unanswered.
It confirmed that McBride had been shot in the face, but revealed little about how the early morning incident on November 2 unfolded.
"There was an entrance shotgun wound to the face, with no evidence of close range discharge of a firearm noted on the skin surrounding this wound," said the autopsy report, which ruled her death a homicide.
Police said McBride was in a car accident earlier that morning, but that hours passed between the crash and the time of her death.
A woman told police that she helped McBride after the car crash, but that McBride said she wanted to go home and walked away from the scene, the Detroit News reported.
The wreck happened about 1:30 a.m. and the shooting at 3:40 a.m.
The homeowner, whose name has not been released, has said that he was awakened before dawn and believed someone was trying to break into his home.
