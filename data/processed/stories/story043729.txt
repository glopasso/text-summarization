Michelle Knight, one of three women kidnapped by Ariel Castro, returned Friday to the Cleveland house where she was chained up and tormented for 11 years, a neighbor said.
The visit came a day after Knight came face-to-face with Castro, telling him during a sentencing hearing: "I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning." Castro was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years.
Knight, 32, stood outside the house at 2207 Seymour Avenue, looking at where she and two other women -- Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus -- had been held for years, neighbor Altagracia Tejeda said through a translator. Then she walked across the street to Tejeda's house, she said.
It was Tejeda's house where Berry and her 6-year-old daughter fled after making their escape May 6 from Castro's house.
It was there, using a cell phone, that Berry made her now famous 911 call: "Help me, I am Amanda Berry. I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here. I'm free now."
On Friday, Knight thanked Tejeda and others for helping in the women's rescue.
During her captivity, Knight said had glimpsed Tejeda on her porch.
A couple of times over the years, Tejeda said she saw what she believed was a young girl through a screen door at Castro's house. She later learned the girl was actually a diminutive woman. It was Knight.
"Did you see me?" Knight asked, according to Tejeda.
Her answer: Yes.
