India's federal police have arrested two senior officials involved in organizing last year's troubled Commonwealth Games in New Delhi for suspected corruption.
Investigators have taken into custody Lalit Bhanot, former secretary-general of the organizing committee of the October 2010 event.
Also placed under arrest was V.K. Verma, director-general of the committee.
They have been held for a suspected over-priced purchase of a timing, scoring and result systems from a Swiss company, federal police spokesman R. K. Gaur said.
India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which is probing allegations of massive corruption in the conduct of the Commonwealth Games of last year in New Delhi, had earlier arrested four other committee officials.
Bhanot and Verma are seen as close aides of Suresh Kalmadi, India's chief organizer of the sporting event that attracted international headlines for alleged scams and messy preparations.
A series of scandals in 2010 have put Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's government on the defensive. This week, Singh  acceded to opposition demands to order a cross-party probe into an alleged multi-billion dollar fraud related to  the award of mobile-phone licenses three years ago.
Politicians, bureaucrats, officials and company executives linked to probes have denied any wrongdoing.
Several high-profile corporate leaders have also been questioned by police in connection with the sale of radiowaves in 2008.
Investigators have arrested A. Raja, who quit as telecom minister as the scandal battered Singh's government.
Singh reiterated Thursday that the guilty will be punished.
"No wrongdoer will escape penalties," he told lawmakers. "As and when we got credible,  actionable evidence, action has been taken."
