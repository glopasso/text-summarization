A passenger ferry ran aground Tuesday near Battery Island, North Carolina, injuring more than a dozen people, the U.S. Coast Guard and the ferry line said.
Fifty-three passengers and three crew members were on board, CNN affiliate WWAY reported. One passenger was flown to a hospital, and 12 others were taken to regional hospitals.
A spokesman for Dosher Memorial Hospital in Southport, not far from Wilmington, said 12 of the victims were transported there and seven other injured passengers walked in to the emergency room.
No one was classified as being in serious condition, Kirk Singer told CNN.
All are expected to be OK, CNN affiliate WECT reported, citing the Coast Guard.
The 64-foot Adventure Ferry came to the sudden stop at about 9 a.m., which threw people around, leading some to crash into tables, a passenger told WWAY.
It was heading from Southport to Bald Head Island at the time.
The Coast Guard and other agencies responded to the scene.
The ferry transport was suspended until the Coast Guard determines the passageway is safe, said Joyce Fulton of Bald Head Island Limited, parent company of Bald Head Island Transportation, which operates the ferry.
As to why the ferry ran aground, she said, "We're still in the fact-gathering mode."
