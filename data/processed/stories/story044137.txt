(CNN)  -- Four months after Oprah Winfrey's daytime talk show leaves the air in September, Winfrey will return to TV on her OWN network, her company said.
"She's going to continue doing what she loves, talking to people, from the famous to the infamous," OWN CEO Christina Norman told CNN. "But this time, she's going to be untethered from the chairs and taking the show on the road."
OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network launches January 1, 2011, replacing the Discovery Health Network, which is distributed in 80 million households, according to Discovery Communications.
"My vision for OWN is to create a network that inspires our viewers and makes them want to be who they are on their best day," Winfrey said in a written statement.
When Winfrey announced last year that "The Oprah Winfrey Show" would end its 25-year run on syndicated television on September 9, 2011, speculation began that she would return with a new show when OWN launched.
Winfrey will "bust out of the studio to explore the world" with her new show, which will be called "Oprah's Next Chapter," Norman said.
"Her interviews are going to be everywhere from the Taj Mahal to under that beautiful oak tree at her home," she said.
The show is one of five new original series unveiled by OWN on Thursday, joining 10 previously announced.
Winfrey will also host a show called "Master Class," Norman said.
"That's where she has handpicked some of the most amazing intellectual leaders of our time to give their life lesson," Norman said. "And we've got an amazing lineup of people who are going to be sharing their life lessons. So everyone from Jay-Z, Condoleezza Rice, Sidney Poitier and Loren Michaels. People whose stories can inspire your story."
Other shows added to the OWN lineup include, "Visionaries: Inside the Creative Mind," "Your OWN Show: Oprah's Search for the Next TV Star," "Gayle King Live!" and "Why Not? With Shania Twain."
