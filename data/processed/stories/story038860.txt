A position previously held by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Cruise now belongs to Robert Downey Jr.
The "Iron Man" star is at the top of Forbes magazine's list of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, having earned an estimated $75 million between June 2012 and June 2013.
Robert Downey Jr.: Pure awesomeness
That's not too surprising, considering the actor's hinted that he was paid $50 million to join Joss Whedon's mega-success, "The Avengers." That superhero ensemble movie went on to make $1.5 billion worldwide, and is the third highest-grossing movie of all time.
Downey's "Iron Man 3" is also one of the biggest box office hits ever, as it has pulled in $1.2 billion globally since it opened in May.
Right behind Downey on Forbes' list is Channing Tatum, who earned an estimated $60 million between June 2012 and June 2013. The busy 33-year-old actor and new dad shrewdly self-financed last summer's male stripper dramedy, "Magic Mike," with director Steven Soderbergh, meaning they didn't have to share profits with studio execs. "Magic Mike" has gone on to gross $167 million worldwide, while Tatum's other 2012 hit, "21 Jump Street," earned $201 million.
In third place on the highest-paid actors list is Hugh Jackman, who made an estimated $55 million last year. Following Jackman is Mark Wahlberg, who brought in $52 million, and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who is in fifth place with $46 million earned.
