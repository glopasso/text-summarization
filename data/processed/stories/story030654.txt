Earlier this week, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, agreed to a deal to fund the government past this November's elections. The deal leaves working out a budget up to the next Congress and provides funding for the federal government through March 2013, well beyond the presidential inauguration in January.
By the numbers, here's a look at how the nation's fiscal situation adds up.
$15,873,767,378,850.16 - Total outstanding public debt on July 30, 2012.
$10,626,877,048,913.08 - Total outstanding public debt held on January 20, 2009, the day President Barack Obama was inaugurated.
