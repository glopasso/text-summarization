The family home where a young Steve Jobs built the first Apple computer may soon become a protected historical site.
The seven-member Los Altos Historical Commission has scheduled a "historic property evaluation" for the single-story, ranch-style house on Monday.
If  the designation is ultimately approved, then the house on 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, will have to be preserved.
The faux religion of Steve Jobs
Jobs moved to the house with his foster parents as a 7th grader, and lived there through high school.
In the attached garage, he and Steve Wozniak toiled to assemble the first 50 Apple 1 computers. The pair sold them to Paul Terrell's Byte Shop in Mountain View for $500 each.
How Steve Jobs' legacy has changed
Nine months later, in 1977, Apple Computer Co. was formally established and moved its operations to nearby Cupertino.
One of the original computers later sold at an auction for $231,000. And Jobs went on to become a visionary who changed the face of computing.
"Steve Jobs is considered a genius who blended technology and creativity to invent and market a product which dramatically changed six industries -- personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing and digital publishing," according to the property evaluation.
"His influence is expected to be felt by multiple generations forthcoming."
The three-bedroom, two-bath house was built in 1952 and is valued at $1.5 million, according to real-estate website Zillow.
