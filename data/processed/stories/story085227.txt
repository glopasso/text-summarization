We know, we know, with Halloween on the horizon, there's a lot to decide: Sexy costume or scary costume? Jack-o'-lantern or pumpkin pie? Healthy trick-or-treats or high-fructose corn syrup?
But it's all in good fun. Unless, of course, we're talking about your dog. Yes, little Fluffy, Belle and Butch see you coming with those rabbit ears a mile away. (Maybe they'd like it more if they knew the United States was spending an estimated $55 billion on them this year? Don't they know we buy those tutus and sweaters out of love?)
Here are a few pets from CNN iReport who pulled off a costume with style, humor -- and maybe even dignity.
Will you be dressing your dog or cat for Halloween this year? Tell us about the costume in the comments, on Facebook or on Twitter @CNNLiving!
