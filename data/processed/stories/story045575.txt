It pays to be "America's Sweetheart."
Sandra Bullock, who celebrated her 50th birthday in July, earned an estimated $51 million in the past year, according to Forbes magazine. Bullock is at the top of the publication's highest-earning actresses list for 2014.
Forbes, which speaks to agents, producers, lawyers and others in the know to come up with its list, believes that Bullock's hefty payday is due to her Oscar-nominated turn in Alfonso Cuaron's blockbuster "Gravity." After its release in the fall of 2013, the sci-fi thriller went on to earn $716 million worldwide.
Coming in second place is Jennifer Lawrence, star of "The Hunger Games" and "X-Men" franchises, who also squeezes in dramas such as "American Hustle" in her downtime. Forbes estimates the young Oscar winner earned $34 million between June 2013 and June 2014.
In third place is Jennifer Aniston, whose $31 million comes from comedies such as "We're the Millers," "Friends" reruns and endorsement deals.
Forbes notes that while these ladies have earned notable paychecks, the totals are below what the industry's top-earning men have made in the same time period. The publication's list of the top 10 earning actors in the business added up to $419 million, while this year's list of highly paid actresses totals $226 million.
