Sandy is winding down, having spent much of its fury in the past two days crashing into homes and trees, cutting power and wrecking coastal cities.
It has claimed at least 40 lives in the United States.
The system still reaches from the Appalachians to the Great Lakes and beyond to Canada, and it is triggering winter storm warnings from the mountains of Pennsylvania to those of Eastern Tennessee and North Carolina.
A running CNN tally reflects a steady restoration of power to affected areas, but early Wednesday, nearly 6.2 million customers were still without power in 15 states and Washington.
Here's a look at how Sandy has affected the United States and Canada.
