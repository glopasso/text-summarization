Basketball star Brittney Griner was cut Monday by a man with a knife while she was on a bus the day before a game with her Chinese team.
Griner, who also plays in the United States for the WNBA champion Phoenix Mercury, put out a message on Instagram assuring her fans that she was OK after the attack in Shenyang.
She described her injury as a "little scratch."
Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported the man was drunk and said he was on the team bus "claiming he was looking for his girlfriend."
Griner wrote that the man chased her and three teammates onto the bus and yelled at them after he cornered them. He finally left, she wrote. Xinhua reported he was arrested by security guards.
"When I got on the bus, I was scared by what I saw. Griner was bleeding," Coach Xu Limin told Xinhua.
Neither Xinhua nor Griner said where on her body she was cut.
The injury must have been minor. On Tuesday, Griner scored 19 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and had six blocks for her team, which is based in Beijing.
"Life can be took at any moment! Cherish every moment! AGAIN IM OK!" Griner wrote on Instagram.
The 6-foot-8 Griner is also a star on the U.S. national team.
