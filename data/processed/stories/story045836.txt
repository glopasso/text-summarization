(Parenting.com) -- Brace yourself for yet more stark economic news: babies may be suffering from more diaper rash in this down economy, reports Advertising Age, which is labeling "America's baby bottoms" as the "economy's latest casualty."

The inverse relation between diaper and rash ointment sales started in 2009 but has intensified in the last year, according to data from Deutsche Bank.
