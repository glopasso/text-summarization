Controlled drugs were found in one of two tour buses carrying rocker Bret Michaels and his band during a traffic stop in northeast Indiana late Wednesday, police said.
No one was arrested, but the evidence was passed along to the DeKalb County prosecutor for consideration of charges, according to the police report.
Drug detection dogs did "vehicle scans" of the buses after a sheriff's deputy pulled Michael's tour convoy over on the northbound side of Interstate 69, police said.
"Both K9s alerted for the odor of narcotics coming from the front of the bus," Deputy Aaron Long wrote in his report.
Another dog alerted to the odor of drugs in the second bus, the one in which Michaels was riding, the deputy said.
"Searches were conducted on both buses yielding marijuana on each bus, as well as a quantity of Schedule II controlled substances on the first bus," Long said. Schedule II substances are those defined as having a high potential for addiction or abuse, but also have a legitimate medical purpose.
Michael's publicist said the buses were stopped because a trailer had no tag light.
"Mr. Michaels allowed an open search of the buses and everything was handled in a professional manner," the publicist said.
Michaels is on tour just months after suffering a massive brain hemorrhage in April.
