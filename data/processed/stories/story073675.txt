The latest video ad from the Republican Senate campaign arm accuses Michelle Nunn, the Democratic Senate candidate in Georgia, of supporting amnesty.
Seems like the usual in hyper-partisan Washington, right? But in attacking the Democratic candidate, the ad also lumps in more than a dozen Republicans, including a rising GOP star who might run for president in 2016.
"Michelle Nunn proudly supports Obama's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants" flashes across the screen during the 30-second spot.
But the ad cites a Politico story in which Nunn expressed her support for a Senate immigration bill that passed with the support of 14 Republicans, who were led by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, who is widely viewed as a potential 2016 presidential candidate.
It wouldn't be the first time conservatives have painted Rubio's support for immigration reform as pro-amnesty, but the National Republican Senatorial Committee ad is an attack on Republican supporters of immigration reform from the establishment.
So, the GOP ad raises the question, does Marco Rubio also "proudly [support] Obama's amnesty plan for illegal immigrants"?
