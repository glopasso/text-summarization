(CNN)  -- Parts of the Texas town of Wheeler were evacuated Saturday as strong, shifting winds fanned wildfires that had already destroyed three buildings, law enforcement officials said.
Wildfires in the Texas panhandle are being fed by sustained winds of about 40 mph.
Two homes and one business had been burned down by a fire that had grown to engulf about 8,000 acres by Saturday night, said Lewis Kearney, a spokesman for Texas emergency services.
Another 12 homes had been damaged, and 300 homes and 60 business were threatened, according to a report from state emergency officials.
The heavy winds -- sustained at about 40 mph with gusts up to 60 mph -- were making it hard for helicopters and other firefighting vehicles to battle the blaze, Kearney said.
Further complicating matters were three other smaller fires, about 100 acres each, elsewhere in the state that had already stretched emergency resources.
There were no immediate reports of injuries in the Wheeler fire.
About 200 residents of the town of about 1,400 people on the eastern edge of the Texas panhandle were evacuated Saturday, state officials reported.
The fire was believed to have started at about 4 p.m. ET Saturday, according to the state report.
