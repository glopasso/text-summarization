(CNN)There was a street named after Chuck Norris, but they had to change the name because nobody crosses Chuck Norris and lives.
Chuck Norris counted to infinity. Twice.
Death once had a near-Chuck Norris experience.
Chuck Norris is celebrating his 75th birthday -- but the calendar is only allowed to turn 39.
That last one is true (well, the first part, anyway). The actor, martial-arts star and world's favorite tough-guy joke subject was born March 10, 1940, which makes him 75 today.
Or perhaps he IS 39. Because maybe YOU can't beat time, but Chuck Norris can beat anything.
Happy birthday!
