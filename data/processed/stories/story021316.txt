(CNN)  -- Mount Redoubt volcano in southern Alaska has erupted again, shooting ash as high as 45,000 feet in the air on Saturday, experts said.
A series of eruptions has been rattling Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano since Sunday.
The eruption occurred at about 1:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET), the U.S. Geological Survey told CNN.
Some of the ash fell around Anchorage, resulting in the airport to close, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The volcano erupted three times Friday, at times shooting ash as high as 51,000 feet.
The eruptions are the latest in a series that began March 22.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory has set the alert level at its highest possible designation -- red -- indicating that an eruption is under way or imminent and that the eruption will produce a "significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere."
Friday's volcano activity prompted Alaska Airlines to limit flights to and from Anchorage, according to the airline's Web site. It canceled all its Thursday flights to and from Anchorage after an eruption earlier in the day sent an ash cloud 65,000 feet high.
The eruptions are the latest in a series that began Sunday.
