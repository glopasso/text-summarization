As the saying goes, don't bring a knife to a gun fight. Or, in this case, don't try to hold up a gun store with a baseball bat and a knife.
Authorities in Oregon say a man who tried to rob a gun store outside of Portland was just so under-armed when he tried to pull off a heist Thursday afternoon. The suspect ended up on the ground, taking orders from the store manager who held the man at gunpoint until police came.
The would-be robber apparently was looking to step up his weaponry -- he smashed a glass display case at Discount Gun Sales and pulled a handgun from the display, the Washington County sheriff's department said in a news release. The store manager then drew his own handgun and ordered the suspect to drop his bat, his 9-inch knife and the purloined handgun.
Washington County deputies responded to the call and found the suspect on the floor when they arrived.
Derrick Mosley, 22, was being held at the Washington County, Oregon, jail, with bond set at $250,000, the sheriff's department said. He was charged with first degree robbery and unlawful possession of a firearm, according to the news release.
