Police say human remains found on a New York beach are not those of a missing woman whose search led authorities to the discovery of four dead prostitutes.
"The remains found off Ocean Parkway, west of Cedar Beach, on March 29 have been determined to not be those of Shannan Gilbert," Suffolk County police said in a statement Thursday.
It is not clear to whom the remains belong.
Gilbert, 24, of Jersey City, New Jersey, was last seen alive on May 1. As authorities searched for clues about her disappearance last year, they uncovered the bodies of four women in various stages of decomposition.
The bodies were stuffed into bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property on Long Island, New York.
Police say they are "continuing the investigation of the remains found on March 29 as well as the investigation of the deaths of four women found off Ocean Parkway in December 2010."
The four bodies were discovered on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach, "which indicates they were dumped there by the same person or persons," Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said in December. "It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location."
He said police could be dealing with a serial killer.
The remains of the fifth body were found about a mile from where the other corpses were discovered, Dormer said.
"There may be clues available now with this body that will help the homicide investigation and will help it move forward," he added.
The four bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine.
All four of the women advertised for prostitution services on the Craigslist website, police said.
At least one body could have been there for as long as two years, Dormer added.
