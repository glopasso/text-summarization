(EW.com) -- This just in: "Simpsons" news anchor Kent Brockman will turn to Aaron Sorkin during a career dilemma.
The Oscar-winning writer and creator of HBO's "The Newsroom" will make a cameo appearance on the animated Fox comedy, EW has learned.
Sorkin, who has also played himself on "30 Rock" and "Entourage," lends his voice to an episode in which Brockman considers switching jobs.

"Kent has decided that local news has been a real mistake and a terrible career move for him," says "Simpsons" executive producer Al Jean. "He wants to interview with a big cable news channel and goes to Fox News."
In a moment of truth during Brockman's meeting at the Fox News, Sorkin appears in a thought bubble above Brockman's head and advises the anchor on whether or not he should work for the cable channel. (The "Simpsons," of course, has a fondness for Fox News jokes.)
The episode â€” which is titled "Four Regrettings and a Funeral" and airs next fall as part of season 25 â€” also includes brief cameos from Joe Namath and Gordon Ramsay (who guested on a season 23 episode). Ramsay pops up in a joke about the Fox network.

Notes Jean: "To give equal time, when we make fun of Fox News, we also make fun of the Fox network."
