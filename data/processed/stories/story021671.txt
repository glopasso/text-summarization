(CNN)Even the most ardent "Frozen" obsessives can watch the movie only so many times before craving new details about the story's next chapter.
And, like snowflakes floating down from the heavens, here they are.
Disney has released five stills from "Frozen Fever," the forthcoming short film that updates its massively popular "Frozen" franchise, along with some fresh details about the seven-minute movie.
Creators of "Frozen Fever" tell USA Today that the film reunites Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff for Anna's birthday, which takes place on the summer solstice in June. Elsa is planning a birthday bash for her devoted younger sister, but things get derailed when Elsa gets a cold, throwing off her magical powers.
"Elsa doesn't get a cold in the usual way," co-director Jennifer Lee told USA Today. "She's special. Surprising things occur that wreak a little havoc."
The short also features a new song by Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, the duo who gave us the ubiquitous "Let It Go."
"Frozen Fever" will show in theaters before Disney's live-action remake of "Cinderella," opening March 13. The original "Frozen" has earned more than $1.27 billion worldwide.
Disney posted the new images Monday to its "Frozen" Facebook page, where it had received more than 119,000 likes by Tuesday afternoon. Reaction from Facebook fans was predictably enthusiastic, although some parents grumbled they'd rather see a full-length sequel.
