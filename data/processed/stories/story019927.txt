On Saturday, two stars from "Facts of Life" got together for a long overdue TV reunion.
Lisa Whelchel and Kim Fields, who co-starred on the '80s sitcom about a group of girls in boarding school as Blair and Tootie, were reunited in the Hallmark Channel TV movie, "For Better or For Worse," which aired on July 19.
After each going their separate ways -- Fields continued to act and direct while Whelchel became a Christian writer and speaker -- returning to a set together was "like riding a bike," Fields recently told "Good Morning America."
"Lisa's a wonderfully talented woman, plain and simple," the now 45-year-old actress said of her co-star.
Whelchel, 51, was just as comforted to take a small screen job alongside a familiar face.
"It was like old times, but really, really different," Whelchel said to People magazine. "We felt comfortable together, because we're such good friends. But I can see her talent as an adult. I would watch her during a scene now and think, 'Wow, she's really good. She's so funny.' I didn't appreciate that as a kid."
