World No. 2 Novak Djokovic stumbled at the opening hurdle at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, but Rafael Nadal and Andy Roddick cruised into the third round.
Second seed Djokovic, who had a first-round bye, was surprisingly beaten 6-2 6-7 (7-9) 6-4 by Belgian Olivier Rochus on Friday.
The world No. 59 could have won in straight sets after leveling at 6-6 in the tie-break, but held his nerve to break Djokovic in the final game of the decider to triumph.
Serbian Djokovic, the 2007 champion, successfully defended his Dubai title last month but bowed out in the last-16 at Indian Wells two weeks ago.
The reward for Rochus is a third-round clash with Brazilian 27th seed Tomaz Bellucci, who defeated American James Blake 3-6 6-1 6-2.
Nadal, the tournament's last second seed to lose his opening match in 2006, had no such problems this time as he beat another U.S. player, Taylor Dent, 6-4 6-3.
The Spanish fourth seed -- beaten in the semifinals at Indian Wells by Djokovic's conqueror and eventual champion Ivan Ljubicic -- will next play Argentine wildcard David Nalbandian, who overcame Serbian 30th seed Viktor Troicki 6-3 4-6 6-4.
Sixth seed Roddick, last weekend's losing finalist, gave home fans some cheer as he crushed Russia's Igor Andreev 6-4 6-4 to set up a clash with Ukraine's Sergiy Stakhovsky.
Eight seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also progressed with a 6-4 6-3 win over Spain's Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, and the Frenchman will next play German 28th seed Philip Kohlschreiber.
World No. 1 Roger Federer begins his bid for a record-equaling 17th Masters 1000 tournament victory against Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti on Saturday, while third seed and defending champion Andy Murray takes on American Mardy Fish.
In the women's tournament, Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin made it a good day all-round for Belgium as the former world No. 1s progressed into the third round.
Clijsters, the 14th seed but champion in Miami in 2005, crushed 20-year-old Czech Petra Kvitova 6-1 6-1 to earn a third-round clash with Israel's Shahar Peer.
Henin, seeded 33rd after receiving a wildcard, beat Elena Dementieva for the second time in her comeback season, winning 6-3 6-2 against the Russian fifth seed.
The Australian Open runner-up will next play Slovakian 26th seed Dominika Cibulkova.
Second seed Caroline Wozniacki came from behind to defeat Bulgarian qualifier Tsvetana Pironkova 3-6 6-3 6-4 and set up a third-round tie with Russia's Maria Kirilenko. The Dane had to come back from 3-1 down in the second set and 3-0 adrift in the decider.
Fourth seed and defending champion Victoria Azarenka also progressed with Indian Wells winner and No. 7 Jelena Jankovic, No. 9 Samantha Stosur and Russia's No. 11 Vera Zvonareva.
