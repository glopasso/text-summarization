Rory McIlroy kept his nerve in the face of a last day charge from Tiger Woods to win the Honda Classic Sunday and jump to the top of the world rankings.
The 22-year-old from Northern Ireland finished with a one-under-par 69 for a 12-under total of 268 at the PGA National in Florida.
The victory will see him leapfrog England's Luke Donald as world No.1, a week after missing out on the honor when beaten by Hunter Mahan in the WGC Match Play final.
14-time major winner Woods showed he is still a force to be reckoned with after a closing eight-under 62, his lowest final round as a professional.
He finished by draining an eight-foot eagle putt on the 18th to set the clubhouse target on 10-under 270.
World no.3 Lee Westwood also charged through the field on the last day with a 63 to finish on eight-under.
McIlroy, under constant pressure from those ahead of him and playing partner Tom Gillis, had to wait until the eighth for his first birdie of the day.
He dropped a shot at the 12th, but retrieved it with a birdie at the next to give himself a cushion playing the "Bear Trap" holes of 15, 16 and 17.
The U.S. Open champion duly completed that test in level par and he played safe on the 18th for a par-five to wrap up his third PGA tour title.
"First and foremost it's just great to win this tournament," McIlroy said.
"It was tough today, especially seeing Tiger make a charge. I knew par would probably good enough today, that's what I was trying to do."
The 43-year-old Gillis birdied the 18th to tie Woods for second, two back, for his best finish on the tour.
