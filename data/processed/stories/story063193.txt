The Mexico Football Federation has banned Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez from national team duty for six months, following reports the pair threw a party at the team hotel after their friendly in Colombia on September 8.
Arsenal forward Vela and Juarez, who signed for Scottish side Celtic during the last transfer window, were not the only players punished over the incident, with 11 other squad members being fined approximately $4,000 each.
Those 11 included Manchester United and Fulham pair Javier Hernandez and Carlos Salcido, as well as Tottenham Hotspur's Giovani dos Santos and New York Red Bulls' star Rafael Marquez.
Unconfirmed reports in the Mexican press claimed that the party, thrown in the northern city of Monterrey, cost around $2,500.
Mexico national team director Nestor de la Torre announced the reprimands at a press conference on Wednesday.
"Carlos Vela and Efrain Juarez will be suspended for six months from the date of these events (September 8), for calls for the national team, because there were faults in four sections of the national team rules," he said.
The other players to be fined were Guillermo Ochoa, Francisco Rodriguez, Andres Guardado, Gerrardo Torrado, Pablo Barrera, Enrique Esqueda and Hector Moreno.
