Toronto Mayor Rob Ford admitted to drinking again after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city's police chief Monday night while he was at a fast food restaurant.
The mayor, who had pledged to refrain from alcohol, stopped briefly to talk to reporters Tuesday when he was asked about the video that shows him incoherently talking to customers at a Steak Queen in Rexdale.
"I was with some friends and what I do with my personal life, and with my personal friends, that's up to me," he said.
The mayor said he only had a little bit to drink and didn't do drugs Monday.
In the video, which lasts 66 seconds, Ford speaks at times in Creole with a Jamaican accent. He is dressed in a suit and tie, with his back to the counter. He uses a profanity at the beginning of the clip to describe Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair.
It's the latest embarrassment for Ford, infamous for admitting he smoked crack and drank too much. Ford has denied being an addict.

Ford's saga began in May, when allegations emerged that he appeared to be smoking crack cocaine on a pipe on cell phone video taken months earlier, in winter 2012.
After initially denying that he had smoked the drug, he admitted in November that he did. The city council later voted to strip him of most of his power as mayor, reducing him to primarily a figurehead.
Ford has ignored calls for him to resign or enter rehab and has said he will run for re-election in October.
