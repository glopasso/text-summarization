West Indies captain Darren Sammy took five wickets as his side wrapped up a 40-run victory over Pakistan in the opening Test match in Guyana.
Pakistan resumed day four on 80-3 seeking 219 to win but slumped to 178 all out just after lunch with Sammy and Ravi Rampaul chief architects of their downfall.
It means the hosts now take an unassailable 1-0 lead in the two Test series, with the next match starting in St Kitts on Friday.
"This is what West Indies cricket is all about," Sammy told the official West Indies Cricket Board web site.
"We're happy. We worked really hard for this win. It was really great the way we were able to deliver on the plans we set out on how we would attack the Pakistanis.
"It's a good feeling. This is about West Indies cricket, we as a team needed this performance, it was total team effort and it was good to come out with a win.
"Lately things haven't been going well but I still have the belief and the rest of the team also have belief. It is still only one victory though and we still have to continue working hard and improving."
Rampaul was the first to strike when he dismissed Asad Shafiq for 42 but Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal steadied the ship, putting on a partnership of 52.
Their resistance was broken by Sammy as he trapped Misbah LBW, one of a record 20 given in the match.
Sammy removed debutant Mohammad Salman two balls later, again LBW, before Rampaul had Abdur Rehman caught in the slips shortly after lunch.
Captain Sammy polished off the tail with three quick wickets, dismissing Akmal for 47 and Umar Gul for one before he bowled Saeed Ajmal to seal victory.
