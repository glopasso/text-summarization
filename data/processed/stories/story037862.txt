Brooke Shields is upset with a tabloid reporter over an incident involving the actress' elderly mother.
Brooke Shields moved her mother to a different residence after last week's incident, Shields' lawyer says.
Shields accused a reporter and photographer from the National Enquirer of taking her 75-year-old mother -- Teri Shields, who suffers from dementia -- out of a New Jersey nursing home last week, People magazine reported.
It was "reprehensible and disgusting," Shields told People.
The reporter, "looking for a tabloid story," signed her mother out of a senior living facility in Old Tappan, New Jersey, by falsely claiming to be her friend, Shields said.  Watch why Shields is upset »
The National Enquirer said the reporter has known Teri Shields for a decade.
"Teri asked the reporter to take her out to lunch and run some errands," the tabloid said.
"The freelance reporter then got permission from the facility to do so. ... At no point did the facility, which had given its permission for the outing, contend that there had been any wrongdoing."
Old Tappan police told People they are investigating.
Brooke Shields' lawyer, Gerald Lefcourt, said the actress has not filed charges, but was exploring her options.
Shields moved her mother to another facility, Lefcourt said.
