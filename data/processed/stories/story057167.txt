This month, Inside the Middle East explores the stories of women throughout the region, highlighting Jordan in particular as a country whose constitution doesn't codify equal gender rights.
Host Rima Maktabi heads north of Amman, to a small village along Jordan's border with Syria, to explore the Hashemite Kingdom's notorious "honor killings." In the past decade, more than 100 Jordanian women have been murdered by their families. Their crimes? Bringing shame and dishonor on the community, typically for mingling with young men or committing adultery. The program meets with one woman who fled to a shelter, far from her family, to escape death threats.
IME also visits the United Arab Emirates Ewa'a Shelter for Women and Children, where victims are given medical and psychological care. We meet Sara Suhail, an Emirati social worker who has devoted her life to helping victims of sexual violence.
The show also returns to Saudi Arabia to chart the progress of Jeddah United, an all-female basketball team that was first featured on IME in 2008, as they struggled in a conservative society where women are not allowed to play sports in public.
