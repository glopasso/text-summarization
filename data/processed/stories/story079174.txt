Thor is now a woman.
On Tuesday, Marvel Comics announced the hammer-wielding superhero will be represented by a female, though the precise circumstances of the changeover are unknown. Presumably, all the details will be spilled in October, when the new storyline begins.
"This is not She-Thor. This is not Lady Thor. This is not Thorita. This is THOR," writer Jason Aaron said in a press release that was widely retweeted.
The Twitterverse generally approved.
"I was at the mall w/my kids & overheard some teenagers (guys & girls) talking about female Thor excitedly & I just am happy to be in comics," tweeted Scott Snyder.
"We now live in a world where Captain America is black, and Thor is a woman. Huzzah," tweeted the Washington Post's Nia-Malika Henderson, noting the news that the new Captain America will be the African-American Marvel character the Falcon, a.k.a. Sam Wilson.
Some wags couldn't resist a joke, however.
"New Female Thor to be paid less than Male Thor. Reports already suggest she is 'bossy' and displays 'God-like' arrogance," tweeted Al Jazeera's Wajahat Ali.
The news was revealed on ABC's "The View."
Marvel's "Thor, the God of Thunder," dates back to 1962. The character was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, who borrowed from Norse mythology -- Thor is part of the Norse pantheon -- and comic-book tropes, as the character takes on a human guise until his powers are brought to the fore by clutching Mjolnir, his fabled hammer.
