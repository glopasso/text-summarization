A warrant has been issued for a New Jersey man who is suspected in the death of his 2-year-old daughter, authorities announced Wednesday.
Multiple law-enforcement agencies are searching for Arthur E. Morgan III, authorities said at a news conference.
A group of boys discovered the child's body partly submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County on Tuesday afternoon, officials said. She was strapped into her car seat, CNN affiliate WABC reported. The stream runs beneath an overpass, suggesting that the child and car seat were thrown from the overpass, said county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni.
Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother Monday night following a custody visit, Gramiccioni said. When he didn't return the girl, prosecutors in Ocean County on Tuesday morning charged him with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody.
The girl was found dead about 20 hours later, WABC reported.
Police say Morgan was last seen between 7 and 8 p.m. Monday on the Asbury Park train platform. A number of federal and state agencies, including the FBI, are involved in the search, suggesting that Morgan might try to leave New Jersey, where he and the child's mother live separately, Gramiccioni said.
"Police are working with every ounce of their being to locate him," Monmouth County Prosecutor Peter E. Warshaw Jr. said.
