Argentina FA president Julio Grondona has spoken about Carlos Tevez's absence from Sergio Batista's squad that faced Portugal on Wednesday, claiming it was a disciplinary measure.
Media reports speculated that Tevez was omitted from the side that beat Portugal 2-1 in Switzerland as a favor to his club side Manchester City, ahead of this weekend's crucial Premier League derby against Manchester United.
But Grondona admitted to a radio station that Tevez was left out as a punishment for his attitude in missing last year's friendly against Brazil in Doha, only to play for City against Fulham just four days later -- scoring twice in the match.
Grondona told Radio Pop: "Tevez's absence was because of his attitude when he didn't come to play against Brazil and shortly after this he took the field for his club.
"That attitude didn't go down well with the coaching staff, it was a lot easier to tell us that he didn't want to come."
However, Grondona was quick to point out that Tevez was not left out because of his close friendship with former Argentina manager Diego Maradona.
"Tevez's absence has nothing to do with Maradona, we cannot go down that road,'' he added. ''I want to leave that crystal clear."
