(Mashable) -- Facebook is rolling out an update to News Feed that lets people sort information by Recent Stories or Highlighted Stories.
The update adds a "Sort" link at the top of the News Feed. Clicking it brings up two options for organizing News Feed content: "Highlighted Stories First" or "Recent Stories First."
Highlighted Stories will push the most important content to the top of the page -- the current way it operates. The Recent Stories option will order News Feed items in reverse chronological order, though it is not as comprehensive as Facebook's real-time "Ticker".
The social network revamped News Feed in September in an attempt to make sure users don't miss the important events in their friends' lives. This was accomplished through the launch of Ticker and an update that highlighted key events that occurred within users' social graphs.
As part of this change, Facebook removed the "Top Stores" and "Most Recent" links at the top of the page. It looks like that some users still wanted a simple way to see News Feed items at any time, though. The new News Feed has the ability to see recent stories in News Feed if you had logged in recently, but it wasn't a comprehensive option.
Facebook says that the Sort feature will be rolling out over the next few days. Do you think bringing Recent Stories back is a good idea? Let us know in the comments.
