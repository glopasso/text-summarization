Orange is the new snack -- that's the case in Ukraine anyway after one of the country's top football players donated 20 tons of tangerines to local children.
Darijo Srna, who plays for Donetsk-based Shakhtar, made the gesture which allowed for the fruit from his hometown of Metkovic in Croatia, which is renowned for the fruit, to arrive in Ukraine.
"As a child, back in Croatia, I also went through a period when I needed help," Srna told the club's official website.
"It is very important that there are people who support you in difficult situations. Donbass and Donetsk gave me a lot. And these citrus fruit is just a small gift that I can give back."
Donetsk has been besieged by fighting with the club's Donbass Arena suffering damage from shelling.
In April 2014, pro-Russian activists took control of government buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine.
This season, Shakhtar has been forced to play its home league games in Kiev, the capital city, while it has hosted Champions League fixtures in Lviv.
"I am missing it a lot," Srna said of Donetsk.
"Every day I read and watch the news. After each game I tell the guys that all the goals we score, all our victories are our gift to Donbass, to Donetsk, to the fans of Shakhtar, who currently have a tough time."
Srna, 32, who grew up during the Balkans war, says he hopes the arrival of the tangerines, each with their own greeting card, will help bring some solace to those in the region.
"I respect Donetsk a lot," he said.
"This is my city. The city in which I have been supported for 11 years, owing to which I matured both as a footballer and individual.
"I do it not for someone to say: "Well done, Darijo!" This is from the heart and soul. I'll try to support all those who need it," he added.
