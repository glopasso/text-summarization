About five to six men, armed with knives and cleavers, rushed into a college dormitory in southern China on Wednesday, wounding nine students -- one of them seriously, state media said.
The pre-dawn incident is the latest in a series of knife attacks in the country in recent weeks.
The men burst into a dormitory at the Hainan Institute of Science and Technology in Hainan province and hacked away at anyone they came across, the China News Network said.
One student had his hand cut off, while eight others suffered varying degrees of injuries, the news agency said.
The attack differed slightly from other recent attacks in that the victims were college students.
Last week, a man was sentenced to death for attacking 29 kindergarten students and three teachers with a knife April 29, according to state media.
Also last week, a man with a kitchen cleaver hacked seven kindergarten students and a teacher to death at a school in northwest China before returning home and committing suicide, state media reported.
