Atletico Madrid upset European champions Inter Milan to secure the UEFA Super Cup in Monaco.
Goals from Jose Reyes and Sergio Aguero handed the Europa League winners a healthy advantage before Inter's Argentina striker Diego Milito missed a late penalty.
It signaled defeat for new Inter coach Rafael Benitez in his first competitive fixture, after taking over from Jose Mourinho, who joined Spanish club Real Madrid.
Inter had the better of the opening half with Dutch midfielder Wesley Sneijder going close from a tight angle.
But in the second half, Atletico posed more problems of Inter's defence and they deservedly took the lead when Reyes' shot squeezed past keeper Julio Cesar at the near post.
As Inter pressed for an equalizer, Atletico doubled their advantage when Sergio Aguero turned home Simao's left wing cross.
There was still time for Atletico keeper David De Gea to save Diego Milto's penalty in the final minute.
Elsewhere, newly-promoted Kaiserslautern shocked German champions Bayern Munich with a 2-0 win in the Bundesliga.
Two goals in as many minutes from Ivo Ilicevic and Srdjan Lakic gave the home side the advantage just after the half hour mark.
Despite fielding a host of World Cup stars, including Franck Ribery, Thomas Muller, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Mark Van Bommel, Bayern couldn't find a way back into the game.
Goalscorer Ilicevic was sent off in the closing stages for a second bookable offence but Kaiserslautern held on to win their second game in a row and climb to the top of the table.
