Suburban Virginia homeowner Jack Webb couldn't believe what security cameras in his yard captured earlier this week -- a group of people punching and kicking a man on his street.
Webb told CNN that a party on Monday night at a nearby house in Springfield, just south of Washington, attracted roughly 50 teens and young adults.
He said he was awakened by noise. Looking out his window, he said he saw what he thought was a small fight with a large group looking on.
It wasn't until he viewed the security footage that he learned it was more of a group beating one person. The victim was kicked and punched multiple times by various people but eventually got up and walked off on his own.
Fairfax County Master Police Officer Eddy Azcarate told CNN that police identified and spoke with the victim. But they are not releasing his name or any further details at this time. No arrests have been made.
Webb installed four surveillance cameras around his house a few months ago after his vehicle was broken into. He said he was "horrified" at the scene on his block this week.
"We couldn't believe our eyes," he said.
