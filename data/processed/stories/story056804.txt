There's no need to worry about another Hurricane Sandy. The name has now been retired from the official list of names for Atlantic tropical storms, the World Meteorological Organization said Friday.
Officials decided Sandy caused so much death and destruction when it hit the Caribbean and the U.S. East Coast in October last year that the name should be removed from the rotating list, according to organization spokeswoman Claire Nullis.
Starting in 2018, the next year that Sandy was due on the list again as the "S" name in the annual alphabetical rundown of storm names, the name will be replaced with Sara, Nullis said.
The World Meteorological Organization is a U.N. agency that maintains the list of Atlantic tropical storms and decides which names to retire.
Names are removed from the list "if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name on a different storm would be inappropriate for obvious reasons of sensitivity," according to the U.S. National Weather Service.
Other names on the retired list include Igor, Gustav, Ike, Paloma, Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan and Wilma.
Hurricane Sandy developed last October and moved through Jamaica and Cuba before hitting Haiti, where it left 51 people dead. The storm was downgraded to a tropical storm but strengthened again to a Category 2 hurricane as it crept up the U.S. East Coast.
Sandy was a huge storm, with winds extending 175 miles from its eye, making it much larger than most storms of its type. Much of the damage it caused was while the storm was still out at sea.
By the time Sandy did make landfall again -- as a post-tropical cyclone, on the southern coast of New Jersey -- it had become known as Superstorm Sandy for the combination of weather events and disasters that it brought about.
The storm killed at least 113 people in the United States and 18 in Canada and is one of the costliest tropical cyclones on record.
