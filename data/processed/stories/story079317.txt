Tensions mounted in Paris, Texas, on Tuesday when about 100 mostly black protesters clashed with white supremacist groups in a verbal confrontation over a black man's death.
White supremacists taunt black protesters who marched Tuesday in Paris, Texas.
The confrontation stems from the 2008 death of 24-year-old African-American Brandon McClelland. After his body was found mangled on the side of a rural road, investigators concluded he was run over, dragged, and killed.
Two white men were initially charged with murder, but the charges were dismissed last month because of a lack of evidence.
Black protesters marched through the town Tuesday, hoisting a flag of red, green and black, the colors associated with African liberation movements. They chanted, "No justice, no peace."
White demonstrators waved a flag emblazoned with a Nazi swastika and taunted the black marchers, shouting through a megaphone: "White power, white power."  Watch the confrontation »
Paris, in northeast Texas, has 25,000 people, 70 percent white and 20 percent black.
No violence or injuries were reported but two white men were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for trying to incite the protesters, Lt. Danny Huff of the Paris Police Department said.
McClelland's mother, Jacqueline McClelland, told CNN the demonstration was not about race but was aimed at achieving justice for her only child.
"We come seeking justice, not only for myself, but [for] other people who have been done wrong," she said. "I want for everyone to get equal justice.
"I don't know the whole story," she said. "I can't be at peace until I know what happened to my child."
