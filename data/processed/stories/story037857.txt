Lists can be tricky.
To kick off our coverage of young adult literature in October, we asked members of the CNN.com newsroom to share books that changed our lives. It wasn't the ultimate list for everyone -- we left the definition of "life-changing" up to individuals, and yes, Judy Blume came up more than once.
But we also asked readers to share their top picks in the comments. Again, we left "life-changing" open to interpretation.
We loved the responses and reasons for your choices, from Mark Twain's "Tom Sawyer" to John Green's "The Fault in Our Stars. So, we complied them and created another list -- the books you read as young people that changed YOUR lives.
Click through the gallery to see what readers came up with, and tell us about books you read as a child that influenced you.
