A man suspected in the killings of 11 women, whose remains were found in his Ohio home, is due in court Wednesday morning.
Human remains were discovered at the Cleveland home of Anthony Sowell in October and November. Sowell, 50, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in December. He could face the death penalty if convicted.
A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for 9 a.m. in Cuyahoga County, according to court documents.
Sowell faces 85 charges, including murder, rape and kidnapping.
At least one victim was strangled by hand, and most of the others by ligature, authorities said. The remains of seven still had ligatures -- string, cord or wire -- wrapped around their necks. The skull of one woman was wrapped in a paper bag and stuffed into a bucket in the home's basement.
The grisly discoveries in Sowell's home have led to the case being called a "house of horrors."
Sowell served 15 years in prison for a 1989 attempted rape and was released in 2005. He was required to register as a sex offender.
