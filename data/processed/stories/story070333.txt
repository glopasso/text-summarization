Pakistan's military launched a series of airstrikes Thursday against suspected militant hideouts, killing at least 37 people and injuring 18 others in the northern tribal area, the military said.
In a statement, the military accused the suspected militants in the Khyber Agency of involvement in recent Islamabad bombings and attacks on Peshawar's police force Tuesday.
Fighter jets from the Pakistan air force began the mission early Thursday, and the strikes were ongoing in the afternoon.
On April 9, a blast at a fruit market in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad killed at least 26 people and injured dozens more.
The blast was close to a bus stop at the entrance of the morning bazaar where vendors arrive early and set up.
On Tuesday, six assailants fired on a police van, killing five officers, Pakistan's Geo TV news reported. The attack injured 11 more people.
