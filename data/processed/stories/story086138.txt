Sherri Shepherd is ready for a new "view."
In Monday's pre-recorded episode of ABC's "The View," Shepherd was both optimistic and emotional. "The View" co-host announced in June she would be leaving the show after seven seasons.
In her final farewell, which Sherri admitted was loaded in the teleprompter, Shepherd got ahead of the headlines and joked about the state of her personal life.
With son Jeffrey sitting by her side, Shepherd said, "When I joined the view seven years ago Jeffrey was 2 years old and I was going through a very public divorce. Now my son is 9 years old and I'm going through another very public divorce. Let's just say I'm happy that Barbara Walters and Bill Geddes were better at picking co-hosts for this show than I was at choosing my husbands."
On a more positive note, Shepherd emphasized that her time on the show was "a dream come true."
"I'm so extremely and profoundly grateful. This has been one of the best seven years of my life," Shepherd reflected. "I didn't want to take this job. ... I have to say my boss Barbara Walters pushed me. I cried in my dressing room for three years saying, 'What am I doing on this table? I don't know what I'm doing!' "
"Look, this table is just not going to be the same without you," said co-host Whoopi Goldberg. Goldberg is the only current host who will return for Season 18, but she will be joined by returning host Rosie O'Donnell.
It won't be long until fans can see Sherri back in the spotlight. Shepherd will make her Broadway debut as Cinderella's wicked stepmother come September.
A new, retooled season of "The View" begins in September.
