More than a million people failed background checks to buy guns during the past 14 years because of criminal records, drug use or mental health issues, according to FBI figures.

Universal background check: What does it mean?

Vice President Joe Biden has led a task force that is recommending proposals to President Barack Obama this week to stem gun violence. One focus of the current debate is whether more can be done in the mental health area.
FBI statistics show that 143,852 would-be gun buyers were turned down for domestic violence convictions or because they were subjected to a restraining order related to domestic violence issues, like stalking or making threats.

People with a history of drug addiction accounted for almost 81,000 denials.
Almost 12,000 illegal immigrants also did not pass background checks to buy firearms.
