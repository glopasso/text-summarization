A lightning strike from a fast-moving storm in Colorado injured 12 soldiers on Wednesday.
One is in critical condition, and the other 11 are in stable condition, Fort Carson said in a statement.
The soldiers had been training Wednesday afternoon when they were notified of lightning in the area.
They were moving to shelter when the storm overcame them, officials said.
"The lightning struck before they were able to get sheltered," said Dani Johnson, a Fort Carson spokeswoman.
