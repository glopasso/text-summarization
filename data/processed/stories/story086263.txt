Australian David Saker has been appointed England fast bowling coach, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) announced on Thursday.
Saker takes over from Ottis Gibson, who took the job of head coach with the West Indies back in February.
The 43-year-old spent six years as assistant coach with Australian state side Victoria, helping them to the Australian state championship twice, and four Twenty20 titles.
He was head coach of the Delhi Daredevils in the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, and an assistant coach during the franchise's first two Indian Premier League tournaments.
Saker played first-class cricket for both Victoria and Tasmania in his ten-year domestic career and is expected to begin his new role before the upcoming ICC World Twenty20 tournament in the Caribbean later in April.
He told the ECB's official Web site: "I believe I can offer the England bowlers a great deal and oversee their development at the highest level. I'm looking forward to working with the impressive crop of bowlers currently in and around the England team."
England team director Andy Flower said: "His [Saker's] record with Victoria in recent times is second to none and he has managed the development of a number of top-class fast bowlers.
"We were sorry to see Ottis Gibson leave the position but we believe we've found an excellent successor and look forward to David joining us in the lead up to what will be an exciting and challenging year ahead."
