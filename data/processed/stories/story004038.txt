Jeffrey Ian Pollack, who directed the popular 1990s films "Booty Call" and "Above the Rim" and produced "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" was found dead on Monday police said. He was 54.
A spokesperson for the Hermosa Beach Police Department confirmed to CNN on Thursday that an unidentified woman informed authorities that there was a man down on a walking trail in Hermosa Beach, California, early on December 23. Police responding to the scene found Pollack on the ground by the side of the walking/running path near a tree.
According to authorities Pollack, who was reportedly an avid runner, was not alive at the time he was discovered. He was found wearing a jogging outfit and with a music player. While the cause of death has not yet been determined, police said they do not suspect foul play.
In addition to producing "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air" starring actor Will Smith, Pollack was a business partner of superstar manager Benny Medina who was the inspiration for the series.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, Pollack and Medina formed a company which became Handprint Entertainment whose management clients included celebs Mariah Carey, Tyra Banks and Jennifer Lopez. The company reportedly folded in 2008.
Pollack also worked with Jeff Beacher, the creator of the Beacher's Madhouse variety shows which were performed at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood. The show has been revamped for a new version with Miley Cyrus hosting and opening December 27 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.
"He was my best friend and partner for a decade," Beacher said in a statement. "He was my brother and father in one. Words can't describe how I feel right now."
