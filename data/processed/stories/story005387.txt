A man carrying a Mexican flag interrupted Wednesday's Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, standing steps away from Malala Yousafzai as she received her award.
Video of the event in Oslo, Norway, shows a young man with a camera around his neck holding a Mexican flag on the stage just a few feet from Yousafzai. He can be seen turning toward the 17-year-old Nobel Laureate and heard shouting "Please Malala" and mentioning Mexico.
Oslo police said the Mexican citizen was not a guest at the ceremony and had managed to go through security checkpoints. He was not carrying a weapon, the police spokesman said.
Mexico's Foreign Ministry confirmed in a statement that Norwegian police had detained a Mexican citizen after an interruption during the ceremony. He remains in custody, the foreign ministry said.
