Sevilla moved into sixth in La Liga after beating ten-man Valencia 2-0 at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in Spain.
Goals from Alvaro Negredo and Alejandro Alfaro sealed victory for the hosts -- a task that was made much easier when Valencia midfielder Mehmet Topal was shown a straight red card.
Sevilla's fifth win of the season took them above Real Sociedad and into the European places on 17 points, nine behind leaders Real Madrid.
Sevilla striker Luis Fabiano wasted two good early openings for the home side while at the other end Juan Manuel Mata forced Javi Varas into a smart save.
But the game turned on 25 minutes when Mehmet Topal flew into a challenge on Martín Cáceres and got his marching orders.
The ten men of Valencia held on until halftime despite almost constant Sevilla pressure, but the deadlock was finally broken on 54 minutes.
Negredo found the bottom corner of the net with a left footed shot from a tight angle after a quick counter attack.
Minutes after that Fabiano hit the bar before Negredo headed wide from inside the area.
But it was 2-0 on 77 minutes when Alfaro headed home Mouhamadou Dabo's cross from close range.
There was still time for Diego Capel to hit the post with a fierce shot in stoppage time as Sevilla completed a comfortable win.
