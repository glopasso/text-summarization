(Rolling Stone) -- The Rolling Stones blend past and present on "Doom and Gloom," their first new song together in seven years.
Mick Jagger sings about class tensions and oil fracking over a Keith Richards guitar riff with shades of Sticky Fingers, while Charlie Watts propels the whole thing with an unfussy, rock-solid beat.
Recorded in Paris earlier this year and produced by Don Was, the tune comes from the Stones' new "GRRR! Greatest Hits" collection, due November 13.
The 50th anniversary compilation includes another new song, "One More Shot," along with classic Stones gems including "Gimme Shelter," "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction," "Jumpin' Jack Flash," "Start Me Up" and "Street Fighting Man."
The Stones released "Doom and Gloom" this morning into a swirl of talk about possible tour dates. In addition to a pair of shows each expected in London and at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn by the end of the year, touring saxophone player Bobby Keys has said he expects "a few added concerts after that."
The band is also the subject of a new career-spanning documentary, "Crossfire Hurricane," which premieres November 15 on HBO.
