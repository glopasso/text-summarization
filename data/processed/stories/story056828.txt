A California company has recalled 34,373 pounds of organic ground beef over fears of E. coli contamination.
First Class Foods Inc. of Hawthorne said recalled packages were produced on December 7 and December 16.
They have "EST. 18895" printed on them, federal officials said.
Products were shipped to California, New Jersey, North Carolina, New York, Wisconsin and Washington state.
A company sampling confirmed a positive result for E. coli. The company and federal officials have not received reports of illnesses associated with these products.
E. coli can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and in severe cases, kidney failure. Babies, seniors and people with weak immune systems are the most susceptible.
