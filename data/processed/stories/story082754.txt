Newcastle United have sacked manager Chris Hughton, the first English Premier League dismissal of the season.
The 51-year-old Hughton led the club back to the Premier League at their first attempt, following relegation the previous season, and had guided them to 11th place in the table.
The Magpies have produced some superb results in recent weeks, notably a 1-0 victory at Arsenal and a 5-1 destruction of north-east rivals Sunderland.
However, Sunday's 3-1 defeat at West Bromwich Albion meant the club have now gone five games without a win, although they did claim a 1-1 home draw with Chelsea during that period.
Explaining their decision, the Newcastle board of directors issued a statement saying: "The board now feels an individual with more managerial experience is needed to take the club forward."
Hughton, who became Newcastle's eighth manager in six years when he was promoted from first team coach following the club's relegation in 2008-2009, had never held a managerial post before.
However, he proved a popular figure with Newcastle supporters, who have been critical of owner Mike Ashley's running of the club in recent years.
The mild-mannered Hughton, who has worked without an assistant since October, was unusually angry following Sunday's loss to WBA, locking his players in the changing room for an hour after the match.
However, his post-match media comments made little indication that he was expecting to be sacked.
Newcastle have put former player Peter Beardsley in temporary charge ahead of an appointing Hughton's replacement.
Meanwhile, Italian Serie A side Brescia have sacked coach Giuseppe Iachini after a run of 11 league games without a win which has left them fourth bottom of the table.
The club have picked up only three points in the last three months and Saturday's 3-0 defeat at leaders AC Milan proved the final straw for the board.
