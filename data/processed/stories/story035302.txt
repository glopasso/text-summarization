(Mashable) -- It's official: the first official biography of Steve Jobs will be making its debut sometime in early 2012.
The book, "iSteve: The Book of Jobs," is being penned by Walter Isaacson, famed biographer and the former CEO of CNN and managing editor of Time.
While very little is known about the contents of the book, Isaacson did manage to obtain unprecedented access to Apple, Steve Jobs and even Jobs' family. Simon & Schuster will publish and distribute the book.

This will be Isaacson's fourth biography, following "Kissinger: A Biography," "Benjamin Franklin: An American Life," "Einstein: His Life and Universe."
"This is the perfect match of subject and author, and it is certain to be a landmark book about one of the world's greatest innovators. Just as he did with Einstein and Benjamin Franklin, Walter Isaacson is telling a unique story of revolutionary genius," Simon & Schuster Publisher Jonathan Karp said in a statement.

Apple's CEO is famously secretive about his personal life. Some of the details of his past have been unraveled in unauthorized biographies such as "iCon: Steve Jobs" and "The Second Coming of Steve Jobs," but none of them paint a complete picture.
Isaacson's book should hopefully provide some concrete answers to unresolved questions about Jobs's life, along with some new insights into how Jobs runs the world's most valuable technology company.
