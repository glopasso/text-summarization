Two New York men accused of brutally beating an openly gay man have been indicted on hate crime charges, authorities said.
The indictment filed Thursday morning charges defendants Daniel Aleman, 26, and Daniel Rodriguez, 21, both of College Point in Queens, New York, of 14-counts of assault and robbery as a hate crime, according to Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown. If convicted, both men face up to 25 years in prison.
Police say the two men shouted "anti-gay remarks" while viciously beating victim Jack Price, 49, as he left a 24-hour deli on College Point Boulevard in Queens in October 2009. After the assault, the two men stole Price's wallet and other personal property from his pockets.
Price was treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens for a broken jaw, several broken ribs, two collapsed lungs and a lacerated spleen.
Aleman and Rodriguez are being held without bail. Their arraignment is scheduled for January 25.
Ted Kasapis, attorney for Rodriguez, said he doesn't believe prosecutors will be able to prove "any hate crimes here."
An attorney for Aleman could not be reached for comment.
