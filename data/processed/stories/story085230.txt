Many stadiums in the country are not privately owned by the teams.
Better stadia is seen by Italian clubs as a way to attracting more fans and thereby generate greater revenue to allow them to compete with their European counterparts.
Milan's move would see the Rossoneri leave the Giuseppe Meazza Stadium it has shared with fierce rivals Inter since 1947.
Design firm Arup is behind the proposed 48,000-seater stadium, which will be sunk 10 meters into the ground so as not to overly disrupt the landscape of the area.
Arup were behind Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena and the Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing, built for the 2008 Olympic Games.
A statement released on Milan's website also claimed the stadium would use the "latest technology and sound-proof materials" to minimize the noise heard in the surrounding areas.
Inter's president Erick Thohir has expressed his desire to see his club move into a stadium of its own.
Design consultants Manica has released concepts of a new home for Inter on its website.
