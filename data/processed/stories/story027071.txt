Catherine Zeta-Jones is limbering up for her Broadway debut.
Catherine Zeta-Jones will make her Broadway debut in Stephen Sondheim's "A Little Night Music."
The Oscar-winning star of "Chicago" will appear alongside Angela Lansbury in a revival of the Stephen Sondheim musical "A Little Night Music," according to an announcement from the show's producers.
The production is set to open December 13 at the Walter Kerr Theater in New York's theater district. Previews begin November 24.
Zeta-Jones will play the lead role of Desiree Armfeldt in the production directed by Trevor Nunn, with Lansbury cast as her mother, Madame Armfeldt.
"I'm honored that Trevor Nunn and Stephen Sondheim asked me to make my Broadway debut in this beautiful production," Zeta-Jones said in a statement. "I look forward to starting rehearsal with this extraordinary group of people and working with the incomparable Angela Lansbury, whose work I've long admired."
Lansbury returned the compliment, describing Zeta-Jones in a statement as a "lovely young actress."
The 83-year-old Lansbury first appeared on Broadway more than 40 years ago and has claimed five Tonys during her stage career. Her most recent Tony came this year for her work in the revival of the Noel Coward play "Blithe Spirit."
"A Little Night Music," with music and lyrics by Sondheim and book by Hugh Wheeler, debuted on Broadway in 1973. It's based on the 1955 Ingmar Bergman film "Smiles of a Summer Night." The 1973 production ran for 601 performances and won six Tonys, including best musical.
The score features "Send in the Clowns," one of Sondheim's best-known songs, as well as "A Weekend in the Country," "Liaisons" and "Every Day a Little Death."
The producers have not announced ticket prices for the revival. Tickets go on sale October 17 for the general public.
