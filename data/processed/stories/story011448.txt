A roadside bomb attack on Monday killed two U.S. soldiers in Baghdad, the U.S. military said.
U.S. troops patrol near a checkpoint in Baghdad last week.
Another soldier was wounded in the attack and taken to a combat support hospital, according to military spokesman Lt. David Russell.
The deaths follow an incident Saturday in which a U.S. soldier died and two others were injured when their vehicle rolled over at a forward operating base near Balad, north of Baghdad, Russell said.
July marked the lowest monthly toll of the war, with 11 U.S. troop deaths -- six killed in hostilities and five dying from causes not related to combat, according to a CNN count of figures released by the Pentagon.
With the three deaths in August, 4,130 U.S. military personnel have died since the Iraq war began in 2003.
