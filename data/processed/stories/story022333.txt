A magnitude-5.9 earthquake hit central Mexico near the Pacific Coast on Sunday night, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
The earthquake was centered more than 200 miles from Mexico City, the USGS said, in the Mexican state of Michoacan. There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries in Michoacan, according to state civil protection officials.
Some people in the capital said they could feel the tremors. Some neighborhoods there were without power, according to a preliminary report from the federal electrical commission.
The quake was 46 miles deep, the USGS said.
An earthquake of this magnitude is considered moderate but capable of causing considerable damage to poorly built or badly designed structures and slight to moderate damage to well-built, ordinary structures, the USGS says.
