Yet another reason for fans of "The Voice" to get "Happy."
NBC tweeted confirmation on Monday that Pharrell Williams will be joining the show as a coach for Season 7 of the reality singing competition.
"Okay, we can OFFICIALLY say it! WE ARE SO #HAPPY to announce PHARRELL WILLIAMS = #NewVoiceCoach for SEASON 7," the tweet read.
That's music to the ears of many fans who have been clamoring for Williams to be involved with the show. In 2013, one of the show's coaches, Usher, brought Williams in as a guest mentor for his team and the "Happy" singer brought it. So much so that it prompted the New York Magazine's Vulture column to headline one of their recaps "Pharrell should be a coach."
"It's been a huge year for Pharrell, with recognition for his contribution in the world of music -- the Despicable Me franchise soundtracks, his Oscar-nominated song 'Happy' and his Grammy-winning collaboration with Daft Punk on the breakout dance hit 'Get Lucky.' His dominance in record sales in 2014, coupled with his incomparable accomplishments in the world of fashion and design, make him an irresistible addition to The Voice family," said Paul Telegdy of NBC Entertainment.
"He has already made a considerable impact as a mentor, drawing on an impressive track record as both a producer and performer. It is a perfect fit for 'The Voice' as we evolve and reach for new heights with this franchise. It feels like we are welcoming an existing family member home."
On Monday Williams retweeted the NBC tweet adding: "This is going to be so fun."
