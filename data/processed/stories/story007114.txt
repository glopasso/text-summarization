British singer Adele is going to have throat-related surgery and is canceling her remaining live appearances for the rest of the year, Columbia Records said Friday.
"She is to undergo surgery to alleviate the current issues with her throat and a full recovery is expected," the record company said in a statement. "As a result, doctors have ordered her to rest her voice and completely recuperate before looking to schedule any work commitments."
Ticket holders will receive a refund from the point of purchase, the record label said.
Earlier this month, the 2011 American Music Awards announced that Adele, 23, lead artists with four nominations -- for favorite pop or rock female artist, favorite pop or rock album (for "21"), favorite adult contemporary artist, and artist of the year.
In July, the soulful singer's "21" was ranked the year's biggest album to date, with over 2.5 million sold since it was released in late February. Also in July, the disc was a consistent best-seller -- it has spent 10 nonconsecutive weeks at Number One and has never ranked lower than Number Three on the albums chart.
