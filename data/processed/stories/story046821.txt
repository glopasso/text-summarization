"The email of the species is deadlier than the mail." So wrote the British actor and novelist Stephen Fry.

Yet, we book our holidays online, we check in online, and, now we even write about our travels online -- emails and blogs packed with photos, video clips and every conceivable detail of our travels.
Where does this online explosion leave the humble postcard?
In the "good old days" we sat and crafted our cards. Saucy for the colleagues at work, respectful to the relatives, begrudging to the next door neighbor.
And always: How to write as much as possible in the tiny white square without spreading over in to the address section. And hoping the postman back home wouldn't mind the paella stains all over the address.
Many of us still value the traditional postcard. According to the Royal Mail, which runs Britain's postal service, postcards are more popular today than they were five years ago.
The service says it processes around 135 million postcards every year, 30 million more than in 2003.
But it's a fact that some people do sniff at snail mail tales from the tropics. Why bother waiting when sending texts with pictures, video, emails by Blackberry will rub in the fact that "We're on Holiday and You're Not!" with greater immediacy.
