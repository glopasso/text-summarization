To kick off the release of her new album, Madonna is joining Twitter for one day to answer questions from fans.
The pop legend will be turning to Twitter on Monday night to promote her 12th studio album, MDNA, and interact with fans on the popular social network. She will be answering questions starting at 10:00 p.m. EST/7:00 p.m. PST.
The Twitter handle @MadonnaMDNAday sent out its first tweet on Sunday to get the word out about the Q&A. Fans can submit questions to Madonna by tweeting @MadonnaMDNAday and using the hashtag #askmadonna. The account already has over 12,000 followers.
The news was also announced on Madonna.com/AskMadonna, with the following message:
"Madonna joins Twitter for one day only to answer fan questions and celebrate the release of her MDNA album. Got a question? #AskMadonna," the site says.
It's uncertain if the account will still send tweets about the album or if it will be shut down after the online event. The Twitter account has not yet responded to questions from Mashable.
Madonna's dip into Twitter isn't just to promote her album, but also to increase her social media presence. She recently granted a Facebook Live-exclusive interview with late-night host Jimmy Fallon on Saturday. Fans â€” who had to "Like" her Facebook page in order to watch the interview â€” were also encouraged to submit questions for the pop queen. Her interview with Fallon was the only talk show appearance planned to promote the album.
Madonna has nearly 9 million subscribers on Facebook.
This is her first album since the release of "Hard Candy," featuring "4 Minutes," in April 2008.
