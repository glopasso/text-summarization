Dutch striker Ruud van Nistelrooy has joined Hamburg on a free transfer from Real Madrid, the German Bundesliga club have confirmed.
The 33-year-old Holland international had been linked with a number of clubs during the transfer window, including English Premier League sides West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur, but has signed a a one-and-a-half-year contract at the HSH Nordbank Arena.
Hamburg coach Bruno Labbadia revealed he was pleased to capture the former Manchester United striker and is confident he will find the net regularly for the club.
Labbadia said: "Ruud has proven his qualities impressively at some of Europe's top clubs. I am convinced that he will also score some important goals for HSV.
"It just emphasises the reputation of our club that a player like Ruud van Nistelrooy decides to join Hamburg."
Van Nistelrooy, who had been frozen out at Real Madrid and was keen to see first-team football in order to boost his hopes of making Holland's World Cup squad, was equally thrilled to have made the switch.
"I am really happy that it has worked out and I am looking forward to Monday when I come to Hamburg," he added.
"I had great talks with both Bernd Hoffmann (Hamburg president) and Bruno Labbadia (coach) and had a very positive impression from the very beginning.
"HSV is a great club with a strong team and big ambitions. I also have big ambitions."
