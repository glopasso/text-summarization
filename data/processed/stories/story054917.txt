A large bomb rigged to a highway overpass in  Indian-controlled Kashmir exploded  injuring at least 17 people.
The blast hit a highway overpass near the Civil Secretariat, the region's seat of government, and its high court complex, senior police official M.B. Nathyeal said Wednesday.
None of the injuries were serious, the attending physician at the hospital said.
It is unclear if the explosion, which happened around 6 p.m. local time (1230 GMT), was the result of a car bomb or a pre-planted roadside bomb, Nathyeal said.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, which damaged part of the highway overpass and shattered the windows of nearby buildings and vehicles. E-mail to a friend
