It's 45 years later but it's still a sunny day, sweeping the clouds away.
"Sesame Street" debuted on November 10, 1969. Since then, it's entertained millions of children and adults. From learning to count to tackling tough issues like racism, Big Bird and the gang have used music and humor to both inform and delight.
Here are five of some of the most adorable moments from the show over the years:
1) Herry and John-John count to 20
Ordinarily a little one might be afraid of a hairy, blue monster. But not when it's Herry the monster who offered an assist to a tyke named John-John as he tackled counting. John-John is also well known for counting backwards with Grover.
A grown up John Williams III later appeared in the 1989 special "Sesame Street: 20 and Still Counting."
2) Kermit and Joey sing the alphabet
This one recently made the rounds on the internet and was declared "The Cutest 'Sesame Street' Moment Ever."
Joey is pretty adorable as she inserts "Cookie Monster" into the alphabet song. And who can resist when she and Kermit exchange some "I love yous"?
3) C is for cookie
Two words for you: Cookie Monster.
This one is a classic and we dare you to not sing along. It's good enough for us.
4) Norah Jones and Elmo don't know Y
"Sesame Street" is well known for its celebrity guest appearances and this one was especially precious.
Norah Jones traded on the success of her song "Don't Know Why" to offer this lament for her missing friend, the letter "Y." Add Elmo to the mix and it's ridiculously cute.
5) Elmo and Lupita Nyong'o love the skin they are in
The Academy Award-winning actress stopped by "Sesame Street" to talk skin and all the beautiful shades and colors they come in.
It was a great message clothed in a whole bunch of cute.
