European champions Inter Milan have announced that former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez has agreed to become their new manager.
The Spaniard will replace Jose Mourinho, who quit to join Real Madrid after leading them to the treble of Italian league, cup and European Champions League.
"We have reached an agreement and we have sorted out the final details, which weren't important things," Inter president Massimo Moratti told the club's official Web site on Tuesday. "All that is needed now is a countersignature."
"Benitez is not in Italy. Tomorrow we will tell you when he will be presented."
Benitez's six-year spell as Liverpool manager was ended by mutual consent last week after a disappointing season in which the club finished seventh in the English Premier League and crashed out of the Champions League in the group stage.
The 50-year-old won the Champions League in his first season in 2005, reached the final in 2007 and captured the FA Cup in 2006.
Previously, he led Valencia to two Spanish league titles and the UEFA Cup.
At Inter, he inherits a club which has won the Italian title the last five years and beat Bayern Munich 2-0 in May to capture the European Cup for the first time since 1965.
Benitez favors a similar tactical approach to Mourinho, with two holding midfielders and a counter-attacking style.
Moratti has denied reports that the club will pay Benitez $6 million a season.
