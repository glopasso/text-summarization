Ethiopia's Deriba Merga forgot his Olympic disappointment when he won Monday's 113th Boston Marathon ahead of Kenyan Daniel Rono and Ryan Hall of America.
Deriba Merga celebrates after winning the men's division of the 113th running of the Boston marathon.
Merga, who faded in the heat of Beijing to finish fourth in the 2008 Summer Games, went clear before 'Heartbreak Hill' and finished almost a minute clear in two hours eight minutes 42 seconds.
Rono clocked 2:09.32 with Hall another eight seconds adrift and the only non-African competitor in a top 10 that included five Kenyans headed by Rono and with Robert Cheruiyot finishing fifth.
Kenya's Salina Kosgei took the women's title by just one second in a relatively slow time of two hours 32 minutes 16 seconds -- with all the drama reserved for the last few strides.
Kosgei outsprinted Ethiopia's Dire Tune, who collapsed after finishing and required medical attention.
Tune won last year in a similar sprint finish and was treated for several minutes before being taken to a local hospital as a precaution.
American Kara Goucher, who led with a mile to go, faded and finished third in 2:32.25 with Bezunesh Bekele of Ethiopia fourth.
The Boston Marathon is the oldest established race over the classic 26.2 miles (42km) distance and has been won over the years by many of the leading names in the sport.
The famous 'Heartbreak Hill' comes 20 miles (32km) into the race and often decides the final outcome.
