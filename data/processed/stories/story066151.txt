(CNN)  -- Mirko Vucinic and Rodrigo Taddei scored second half goals as AS Roma beat Juventus 2-0 in the quarterfinals of the Coppa Italia Thursday night.
Montenegro's Vucinic struck in the 65th minute while Taddei sealed Roma's passage to the semifinals in added time.
The victory in Turin earns Roma a clash with holders Inter Milan, while Palermo will face AC Milan in the other two-legged last four encounter.
It was the seventh win in eight matches for Claudio Ranieri's improving side, who have moved up to a challenging third in Serie A behind leaders Milan. But it was a sorry defeat for sliding Juve with a Europa League place for the winners of the domestic cup at stake.
Vucinic scored after taking a pass from Daniele De Rossi and Taddei produced an acrobatic finish for the second.
AC Milan beat Sampdoria 2-1 in their quarterfinal on Wednesday to stay on course for the treble. They face Tottenham Hotspur in the last 16 of the Champions League next month.
Inter won 5-4 on penalties away at Napoli after the match had finished 0-0, as they continue their unlikely bid to emulate the treble achieved under Jose Mourinho last season.
Palermo were the first to make the last four on Tuesday when they beat Parma,  also 5-4 on penalties.
