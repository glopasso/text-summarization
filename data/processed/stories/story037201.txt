(CNN)Well isn't that non-dairy delightful?
Starbucks announced it will begin offering coconut milk as a non-dairy option for an additional 60 cents. The Internet, at least, loves this plan -- and the company's customers can thank themselves for the move.
"Providing a non-dairy alternative to dairy and soy is the second most requested customer idea of all time from MyStarbucksIdea.com, generating more than 84,000 votes," says a press release on the company's newsroom site.
The news had some consumers practically foaming at the mouth.
Starbucks will start offering Single Origin Sumatra Coconut Milk at its U.S. stores starting February 17.
