(CNN)Four workers died in a massive oil rig fire that raged for hours off the coast of Mexico Wednesday.
Mexican state oil company Pemex said 45 workers were injured in the blaze, which began early Wednesday morning. Two of them are in serious condition, the company said.
Authorities evacuated about 300 people from the Abkatun Permanente platform after the fire started, Pemex said. At least 10 boats worked to battle the blaze for hours.
The fire had been extinguished by Wednesday night, Pemex said in a Twitter post.
The company denied rumors that the platform had collapsed and said there was no oil spill as a result of the fire.
The state oil company hasn't said what caused the fire on the platform, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico's Campeche Sound. The fire began in the platform's dehydration and pumping area, Pemex said.
