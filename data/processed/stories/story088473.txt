Embers from fireworks at Magic Kingdom ignited a small fire at Disney World's latest ride, the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, on Saturday night.
The fire was quickly put out, and no one was hurt, a Disney spokeswoman said.
The nightly fireworks had just ended when embers landed on the building outside the attraction about 10:30 p.m., igniting the fire, the spokeswoman said.
Passengers on the ride were able to get off safely, and no one was evacuated, she said.
The ride reopened about an hour later.
