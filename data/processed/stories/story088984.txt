Seventeen western Georgia students were transported to area hospitals Thursday morning after their school bus crashed with a pickup truck, a school official said.
The driver of the pickup truck was seriously injured and was airlifted from Haralson County to Grady Memorial Hospital -- about 50 miles east, in Atlanta -- according to the Georgia State Patrol.
The accident happened around 7:20 a.m. on State Highway 120, said Kersha Cartwright, public relations coordinator for the Haralson County School System.
None of the students, who were from elementary to high school age, suffered serious injuries, Cartwright said.
Video from CNN affiliate WSB showed the bus hooked up to a tow truck on the tree-lined, two-lane highway.
