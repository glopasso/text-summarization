Musician Peter Gabriel wants people to recreate scenes from "Sledgehammer," his popular 1986 stop-motion music video that MTV tells Mashable is one of the most-played clips ever on the TV network.
An interactive tab on the former Genesis rocker's Facebook page allows his fans to pick a scene from the music video, record a re-creation or upload an existing YouTube clip and vote for the best submissions.

The "Grab Your Sledgehammer" contest is tied to the 25th anniversary of Gabriel's "So" album, which will be re-released Oct. 22 in three different versions (see video below).
One winner will receive a TDKperformance Wireless Boombox and autographed artwork, while 30 runners-up will earn "Sledgehammer" posters.
The "Sledgehammer" video won nine MTV Video Music Awards in 1987.
