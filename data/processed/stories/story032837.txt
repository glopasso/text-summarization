(PEOPLE.com) -- Cameron Douglas, who is serving a five- year federal prison sentence for drug dealing, pleaded guilty Thursday to possessing drugs in his jail cell.
For the latest charges, the son of actor Michael Douglas faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, plus a $250,000 fine.
Douglas, 32, is charged with possessing items that tested positive for cocaine and heroin, which were found in his cell by an investigator. Assistant U.S. Attorney Justin Anderson told the court one of the substances tested positive for methadone, which he described as "something that people take when they're coming off a heroin addiction in order to facilitate the withdrawal," according to a court transcript.
The charges state that Douglas obtained the narcotics both at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, as well as after he was transferred to a minimum-security jail in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania In court Thursday, he admitted struggling with addictions to heroin, cocaine and alcohol.
"God knows I am sorry," records show he told the judge.
Michael Douglas said in a statement: "Cameron accepts full responsibility for his conduct, which involved a small user-quantity of drugs. While he has made much progress, he is still not cured. Most people and their families are able to address this illness privately and outside of the spotlight. Unfortunately this has not been possible here, for reasons completely outside of his control. He thanks those that have rooted for his recovery and looks forward to the day when he will not disappoint."
Douglas is scheduled to be sentenced December 21.
