DENVER, Colorado (CNN)  -- Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama called his acceptance speech on Thursday "the American Promise." It included a list of promises for change that he said, "We need right now."
Sen. Barack Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.
Here is a look at what Obama said he would do, if elected, about a variety of topics:
Taxes
Obama said he would:
• Cut taxes "for 95 percent of all working families."
•  "Eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses" and start-ups "that will create the high-wage, high-tech jobs of tomorrow."
• Advocate "a tax code that doesn't reward the lobbyists who wrote it, but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it."
•  "Stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas" and "start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America."
Energy
