A man was charged Saturday in Wales with the murder and abduction of a 5-year-old girl, April Jones, who has been missing since Monday.
Mark Bridger has also been charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice, prosecutor Iwan Jenkins said.
Meanwhile, the police search for April continues in and around the town of Machynlleth, in a remote corner of rural mid-Wales.
Bridger, 46, was arrested on suspicion of murder Friday. He had been in police custody since being arrested on suspicion of abduction Tuesday.
He will appear before magistrates in Aberystwyth on Monday morning, Jenkins said.
"I realize that this is an incredibly difficult time for April's family, friends and the community," he added.
Superintendent Ian John, of Dyfed-Powys Police, said that the force remained "totally focused and committed" to finding April.
Specialist police search teams have been scouring building in and around Machynlleth, as well as the surrounding mountainous and wooded countryside and a nearby flooded river.
Hundreds of local volunteers who had been helping police in the hunt were asked to leave the search to the professionals as it became apparent that it was now a murder inquiry.
April's mother made an emotional appeal earlier this week for information leading to her daughter.
She was taken from a street near her home as she played on her bicycle with a friend.
Chief Constable Jackie Roberts said the investigation had been "one of the most complex and fast moving" in the history of the police force.
She also paid tribute to the efforts of local residents who had rallied round to try to help the little girl.
Prime Minister David Cameron earlier this week said the abduction was "every parent's nightmare."
