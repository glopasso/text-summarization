Ohio State University has picked ex-Florida coach Urban Meyer as the new head of its scandal-tarred football program, the school announced Monday.
Meyer, a onetime Ohio State graduate assistant who led Florida to two national college football titles, will replace Jim Tressel, who resigned in May. In a statement released by the university, Meyer said he was "honored and humbled" by the chance to lead the Buckeyes.

"My duty is to ensure that Ohio State's football program reflects and enhances the academic mission of the institution," he said. "I am part of it, I believe in it, and I will live it."
Tressel resigned after being fined $250,000 and suspended for lying to National Collegiate Athletic Association officials investigating allegations that his players had received special benefits from local businesses. The school vacated its 12 wins from the 2010 season and put itself on two years' probation after Tressel's departure.
Meyer's return to coaching comes just under a year after he stepped down from Florida's head coaching job, saying he needed "to put my focus on my family and life away from the field." He led the Gators to NCAA football titles in 2006 and 2008 during his six-year tenure.
