Despite a report Tuesday of possible hazardous materials at a mail facility at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in the nation's capital, no suspicious packages or letters were located, a Defense Intelligence Agency spokesman said
The agency's mail-screening equipment alerted officials to the possible presence of a hazardous substance. Preliminary tests indicated it was a possible biotoxin, officials said earlier.
But after an on-scene investigation, it was determined there was no threat, Lt. Col. Thomas F. Veale, an agency spokesman, said.
The FBI has taken samples and will conduct further testing, he said.
