(Mashable) -- Fans of the "Angry Birds" franchise, take notice: The disgruntled feathery creatures have conquered space, and they're out to show those dastardly pigs a lesson.
The latest installment of this megapopular game, "Angry Birds Space," is now available for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch and Android devices, as well as the Mac and PC.
The new version brings several important changes, most importantly gravity, which will allow players to use nearby planets to perform trick shots on unsuspecting pigs.
The game has 60 levels, with more content available through in-app purchases (only in the iOS version for now). The game includes hidden goodies and secret levels, and Rovio promises regular free updates for the future.
Owners of Apple's new iPad will be glad to know that the game supports the new Retina display as well.
You can get the iPhone version here. The iPad version is available here, and the Android version is available over at Google Play.
Finally, the Mac version is available in the Mac App Store, while the PC version is available directly from Rovio.
