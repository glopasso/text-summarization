Dina Lohan, mother of actress Lindsay Lohan, was arrested and charged with two counts of driving while intoxicated Thursday night, New York State Police said Friday.
According to a press release from the police, the elder Lohan was stopped at approximately 11 p.m. Thursday when the white BMW she was driving westbound on the Northern State Parkway was observed traveling at 77 mph in a 55 mph zone.
Police said Lohan, who lives in Merrick, New York, was arrested on charges of DWI and aggravated DWI after a breath test showed her blood alcohol concentration to be .20, which is more than twice the legal limit.
Following being taken into custody and transported to a local police station, Lohan claimed she had been injured during her arrest. She recanted her statement after being evaluated by emergency personnel, who found no injuries.
Lohan, 50, was issued traffic tickets for the two DWI offenses and speeding. She was later released to a sober third party. She is scheduled to appear in Nassau County 1st District Court on September 24 to answer to the charges.
