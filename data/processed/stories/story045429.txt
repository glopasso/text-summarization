(CNN)If you've always wanted to have a beer with "Family Guy's" Peter Griffin in real life, give Robert Franzese a call.
Franzese is a New York-based cosplayer who also happens to do an insanely accurate impression of the cartoon dad from Quahog, Rhode Island. With a white button-down shirt, a pair of green pants, round glasses and his spot-on vocal work, Franzese can transform from everyday guy into something right out of a "Family Guy" episode.
Franzese's character has been a hit at conventions like New York Comic-Con, and a recent YouTube video from BOOM! Big Pants shows just how much of a celebrity he has become.
"Impressions just really came naturally to me," Franzese explains in the clip, which -- be warned -- contains coarse language. "So I slapped together stuff that I had. ... and was like, great, Peter Griffin. Just one stupid joke, where I go to the ATM, and I'm like, 'Oh, my God, I won!' And from then on, it's just caught like wildfire."
He's become so popular that he's caught the eye of "Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane, who retweeted the YouTube video of Franzese on Wednesday.
In his everyday life, Franzese swears he's a "nobody": "I have a nobody job, making nobody pay," he says in the video.
But when he goes to Comic-Con, "people are pulling out phones like I'm freaking Brad Pitt," he continues. "It makes me feel like a million bucks. It's the reactions that I get out of what I do that gives me the joy of what I do."
