Three members of the "Midnight Rider" moviemaking team have been indicted in the death of a camera assistant.
Randall Miller, Jody Savin and Jay Sedrish were charged Thursday with involuntary manslaughter and criminal trespass regarding the death of Sarah Elizabeth Jones, a camera assistant on the film. Jones was on the set of the Gregg Allman biopic when she was struck and killed by a freight train near Savannah, Georgia, on February 20.
The indictment notes that Miller and Savin are the owners of Unclaimed Freight Productions Inc., the film's production company. Sedrish was the executive producer.
Under Georgia law, involuntary manslaughter carries a potential sentence of 10 years. Criminal trespass, a misdemeanor charge, has a potential sentence of 12 months.
Six other crew members were also injured in the accident, which occurred when Jones and others were filming on train tracks in Wayne County, Georgia. A CSX train, moving at about 58 mph, came through and struck Jones.
After the incident, Jones became the subject of mourning in the film community. Friends set up a Facebook group, Slates for Sarah, and she was even noted in the Academy Awards' "In Memoriam" montage.

Gregg Allman, "Midnight Rider's" subject, also shared his condolences.
"I am so terribly saddened by the news of the tragedy that took the young life of Sarah Elizabeth Jones on the film set," he wrote on his website. "My thoughts and prayers go out to her family, friends and colleagues during this time of mourning."
