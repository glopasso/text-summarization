Afghan and NATO troops killed 10 insurgents during separate sweeps in southern and eastern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Monday.
ISAF said coalition troops spotted insurgents placing an improvised explosive device in the Musa Qal'ah district of Helmand province and killed several with small arms fire.
In the Tagab district of Kapisa province, ISAF said a combined patrol of coalition and Afghan forces came under fire from insurgents. The patrol returned fire, killing and wounding what ISAF described as "numerous" insurgents.
ISAF also said separate patrols found a number of weapons, ammunition and explosive components in caches located in eastern and southern Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, one person died and 26 were injured when a car bomb exploded Monday as police were picking up their paychecks in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, authorities said.
The bomb detonated in a Toyota Corolla about 500 meters (1,640 feet) from Kabul Bank, a police security director there said.
The Kandahar Government Media and Information Center said the injured included 16 police and 10 civilians.
