Dempsey. Beasley. Howard.
With their exhilarating win and nailbiting draw (let's not talk about the loss) in the World Cup, the boys of the U.S. Men's National Team are taking on one-name status. But while we've been mightily impressed by their never-say-die attitude on the field, it turns out they're darned nice guys off it: family men, musicians and animal-rights advocates. Here's a side of Team USA that you might not have seen, told through their Instagram feeds.
The team plays a win-or-go-home game against Belgium at 4 p.m. ET Tuesday.
DaMarcus Beasley: He loves his baby, bowling and bling
If there were a World Cup for adorable, his daughter Lia would win.
John Brooks: Dog lover. Big brother.
Jermaine Jones: Rarely cracks a smile
The midfielder is usually sporting a serious face even when showing off his tattoos. Seriousness must run in the family; his children sport a similar look.
Clint Dempsey: Has friends in high places
Tim Howard: Serious tattoos
And that beard.
Graham Zusi: Is very fond of four-legged friends
Brad Davis: His FuelBand is cooler than yours
Has an eye for the red, white and blue.
Matt Besler: Cleans up nicely
And a great eye for nature photography.
Omar Gonzalez: Learning to play guitar
And part-time drone pilot.
