Fire officials in Orange County, California, ordered the evacuation of hundreds of homes while personnel work to control a wildfire that has charred roughly 1,500 acres in the Silverado Canyon area.
The Silverado Fire began Friday in the mountains of Cleveland National Forest and is currently 10% contained, officials said. But with record-high, triple-digit temperatures expected to continue through the weekend, the chances of controlling the blaze in an area with heavy, tinder-dry brush and rugged terrain are worrisome.
"Because of the drought and high temperatures, it makes (fuel components) very receptive to ignition. We get any embers and we got a 95 percent chance of the thing igniting," said Chon Bribiescas, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, told CNN affiliate KABC.
A heat advisory was issued for all of Orange County until Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service.
The official cause for the fire is still unknown. But the Forest Service told KABC that the fire began in someone's backyard.
More than 800 fire personnel are on site working to control the blaze, along with the aid of 15 aircraft vehicles. Three firefighters were hospitalized and released after suffering heat-related injuries, according to CNN affiliate KTLA.
Approximately 217 homes were ordered to evacuate the area as a precaution.
