The 12-12-12 Concert for Sandy Relief marked a historic night in music, not only due to its lineup of music legends but also unique collaborations between artists over the course of the colossal six-hour concert.
Bruce Springsteen sang alongside Bon Jovi at the top of the show, while former Beatle Paul McCartney joined the grunge-rockers of Nirvana in the finale.
Pink Floyd's lead singer Roger Waters also sang the praises of his 12-12-12 onstage partner, Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder. The two vocalists teamed up for a rendition of Pink Floyd's 1979 hit, "Comfortably Numb," alternating on the song's lyrics.
"Eddie was absolutely amazing, so that was like a dream come true to have him come and sing 'Comfortably,' that was magical," Waters told CNN backstage following his performance.
The Pink Floyd frontman was so thrilled with his onstage partner that he says he even took a break from performing to show him some love.
"I actually think I stopped singing at one point to kiss him, which is weird!" Waters told CNN. "That's very rare that I do anything like that."
Other performers partaking in the benefit concert included Eric Clapton, Billy Joel, Alicia Keys, Kanye West and The Who. Proceeds and donations went to the Robin Hood Relief Fund for Sandy victims.
A spokesperson for Robin Hood tells CNN that the foundation will not have a final tally of how much the concert raised overall until Monday, but confirms that advance revenue generated from ticket sales, sponsors and corporate donations reached more than $30 million.
