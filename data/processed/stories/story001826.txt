(CNN)Beyonce's army of fans call themselves the BeyHive, and at any perceived insult to Queen Bey, they swarm.
Photos posted on the fan site The Beyonce World led fans Wednesday to sting the website for representing her in a less than "flawless" light.
The pics appear to show unretouched, close-ups of the singer's face complete with the blemishes of a mortal human.
Web sleuths have put two and two together to speculate that the images were taken for a 2013 makeup ad campaign. Beyonce is a spokesmodel for L'Oreal.
After outcry from fans, The Beyonce World pulled the photos and posted a statement:
"Due to the disdain of the BeyHive, we have removed the photos. We don't want to cause any drama, nor do we wish to start fan wars. Some of the things we have seen posted were just horrible, and we don't want any parts of it. We were just posting the photos to share the fact that our queen is naturally beautiful, at the same time she is just a regular woman."
Defamer and Complex grabbed the images before they were removed from the site, and the web is abuzz with reaction.
A message to Beyonce's representative was not immediately answered.
