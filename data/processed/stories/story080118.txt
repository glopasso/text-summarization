Norwegian Tony Andre Hansen has been stripped of his Olympic showjumping bronze medal -- and banned for our-and-a-half months by the International Equestrian Federation -- after his horse tested positive for a banned substance at the Beijing Games.
Hansen was Norway's highest-scoring rider as the nation finished third in the Olympic team showjumping.
The 29-year-old Hansen was the best performer in a four-rider Norway team which won bronze under a scoring system where the top three count.
Without his scores, his teammates -- Morten Djupvik, Stein Endresen, and Geir Gulliksen -- drop out of medal contention.
The fourth-placed Switzerland team of Steve Guerdat, Christina Liebherr, Niklaus Schurtenberger and Pius Schwizer will now be awarded the bronze medals by the International Olympic Committee.
The United States won gold, beating Canada in a jumpoff in Hong Kong, where the equestrian events were staged last August.
Hansen's horse, Camiro, tested positive for capsaicin, a banned pain relieving medication. He was provisionally suspended and did not complete the individual jumping competition.
However, he is free to return to competition on January 3 as his suspension was backdated.
"It is each person's duty to ensure that no prohibited substance is present in his or her horse's body during an event," said the FEI.
Although the drug can be used out-of-competition as a legal medication, it is also classed as a doping substance if used to inflame a horse's legs. This is done to encourage horses to jump higher because striking an obstacle becomes more painful.
Hansen is the fourth rider disqualified and suspended in cases involving capsaicin: Germany's Christian Ahlmann was suspended for four months, Brazil's Bernardo Alves for three-and-a-half months, and Irish rider Denis Lynch got a three-month ban.
