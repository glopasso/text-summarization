Name an activity that kids might dream up for their perfect vacation and Florida's Ponte Vedra Inn & Club probably has it. They can join lawn games and craft classes, improve a tennis or golf swing, take a horse ride along the private beach, and learn a captain's secrets for catching flounder.
It's a winning recipe that has earned Ponte Vedra the title of America's best family hotel, according to Travel + Leisure readers, who voted in the annual World's Best Awards survey. And like many of the top-ranking properties, Ponte Vedra delivers meaningful, experiential travel and the option for tailor-made experiences.
So say good-bye to one-size-fits-all travel. You won't have to choose between amusement parks and museums or French fries and fresh seafood -- 2013's batch of winners has a little something for everyone.
