(EW.com) -- The weekend of July 4th is a time for doing American things: grilling, watching fireworks, ignoring zoning restrictions and setting off your own fireworks. But shenanigans are tiring, you know? The sun will give you a sunburn. The grill will make your clothes smell like smoke. We at EW much prefer to test our endurance in other ways, mostly by watching TV.
There's a whole set of marathons on for the weekend, some highly publicized (can you make it through three straight days of The Walking Dead?), some obscure and ready for love (a marathon of the animated Transformers series, which is surely better than seeing the new movie in theaters). We've compiled a list from Friday through Sunday below. Trust us, this is way better than a weekend at the beach.
Note: All listings are ET
