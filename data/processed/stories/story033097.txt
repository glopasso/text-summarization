Manchester City moved three points clear at the top of the English Premier League with a convincing 3-0 home win over sixth-placed Liverpool on Tuesday.
Goals from Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and a James Milner penalty put City ahead of second-placed local rivals Manchester United, who visit Newcastle on Wednesday.
Roberto Mancini's men survived the second-half dismissal of Gareth Barry in the 73rd minute, and even added to their tally as Martin Skrtel pulled down Toure and Milner converted from the spot.
It completed a miserable evening for Liverpool, who were missing striker Luis Suarez after club officials confirmed before the match they would not appeal his eight-match ban for racially abusing Patrice Evra.

City captain Vincent Kompany said his team had shown great character after the Sunderland defeat.
"It was massive for us, we didn't deserve to lose against Sunderland but we were incredibly efficient today," Kompany told Sky Sports.
