(CNN)Turkey has arrested a person -- working for an undisclosed nation's intelligence service -- on suspicion of helping three British girls who are thought to have entered Syria to join ISIS, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Thursday.
This person was working for a country that is part of an international anti-ISIS coalition, Cavusoglu said.
Separately, a Turkish official speaking on condition of anonymity said that the suspect is not Turkish, and is not a citizen of the country for which he was working.
Who has been recruited to ISIS from the West?
Britain's Foreign Office on Thursday released a statement about the arrest.
"We are aware that an arrest has been made by the Turkish National Police and that the Metropolitan Police have informed the families of the three girls," the statement read.
"There has been close cooperation between ourselves and the Turkish authorities, and the Foreign Secretary is in regular contact with his Turkish counterpart.  As soon as the UK received this information it was acted upon appropriately."
