A spectacular "kinetic cube" is lighting up Seoul's district of Gangnam.
Comprised of 576 clear LED poles that move up and down, the 36-square-meter matrix, named "Brilliant Cube," continuously flashes hypnotic, colorful patterns and images in one of the most crowded -- and now famous -- areas of Seoul.
Korean media artist Jin-Yo Mok created the 3D matrix in collaboration with Seoul-based media artist group Jonpasang, and requested animation images from fellow media artists Jussi Angesleva and Alvaro Cassinelli.
The full hypnotic effect, that uses up to 120 kilowatts per day, can be seen in this video.
More than 50 people were involved in the four-month production process.
"It should have taken a lot longer actually, but the Korean work environment doesn't allow this so we finished very quickly," said Mok.
Mok was also the creative mind behind the beautiful three-layer LED facade of another Seoul icon -- the Shinsegae Department Store -- as well as the dramatic kinetic landscape "Hyper Matrix" exhibited at the Yeosu Expo last year.
Hyundai Motor Company commissioned the $1.5 million work, with additional support from the Gangnam district government.
Mok's artwork -- infusing art with technology -- fit the image that Hyundai has been increasingly aiming to project, leading to the Korean conglomerate's commissions of both "Brilliant Cube" and "Hyper Matrix."
This latest project was unveiled in October with much fanfare. It was planned to show until December, but the end date has been extended until March due to its popularity.
"It will probably be moved to the national museum of contemporary art in Seoul after March," said Mok.
