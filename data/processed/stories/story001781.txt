Special coins designed to mark the christening later this month of Prince George, the baby son of Prince William and his wife, Catherine, go into production Tuesday in Britain.
Prince George, who was born in July, is the first royal baby to be honored with a christening coin from the Royal Mint.

The design of the coins, to be produced by the Royal Mint in a range of sizes and materials, has been approved by his parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and his great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, the Royal Mint said.
Members of the public can buy the keepsakes, which start at 13 pounds ($21) for the simplest type but rise to a whopping 50,000 pounds ($80,000) for a version containing a kilogram of gold.

The inscription on the coin reads, "To celebrate the Christening of Prince George of Cambridge 2013" and is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs.
The christening will be performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev. Justin Welby, on October 23 at the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace.
A special silver coin was also issued to mark Prince George's July 22 birth. He is third in line for the throne after his grandfather, Prince Charles, and father, Prince William.
