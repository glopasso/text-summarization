Singer Carrie Underwood has gotten engaged to hockey player beau Mike Fisher, her spokesperson confirmed to CNN.
"I'm happy to confirm that Carrie Underwood is engaged to Mike Fisher, and the couple couldn't be happier," said Jessie Schmidt. "No wedding date has been set at this time."
Fisher plays for the Ottawa Senators hockey team in Canada.
During an appearance on Ellen Degeneres' talk show in November, Underwood joked with the host that the relationship -- then almost a year long -- was the longest she had ever had.
"I joke and say my dogs are the longest relationship ever," Underwood said.
The couple have been enjoying a long distance relationship and Underwood demurred at the idea of living together.
"No, call me old-fashioned," Underwood said during her interview with Ellen. "He's there. I'm here. We're both doing our thing and it's good. The next guy I move in with will be my hubby."
Underwood, who has risen from being a former winner of "American Idol" to a country music superstar,  has been linked in the past with Dallas Cowboys football player Tony Romo and "Gossip Girl" actor Chace Crawford.
