Egypt's highest court Sunday invalidated the nation's upper house of parliament and a panel that drew up the constitution, state media reported.
The upper house, or Shura Council, holds legislative powers. It will be dissolved after a new lower house is elected, state-run Ahram reported.
The court dissolved the lower house of parliament last year, paving the way for the council to take over legislative powers pending a new parliament.
Last year, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy issued an order preventing any court from overturning his decisions, essentially allowing him to run the country unchecked until a new constitution is drafted.
A flurry of protests pitting his supporters against opponents forced him to cancel most of the controversial decree that gave him sweeping powers.
The constitution was drafted by an Islamist-dominated assembly in November and approved by voters in December.
Morsy signed a decree shortly after, putting into effect his country's newly approved constitution.
