Pakistan bounced back to win the third Test against England by four wickets at the Oval in London as veteran batsman Mohammed Yousuf completed a successful return to international cricket on Saturday.
The tourists, whose country has been devastated by floods, reduced England's series lead to 2-1 ahead of the final match at Lord's starting next Thursday as Yousuf's experience proved vital.
Recalled after receiving an indefinite ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board in March following his role in the disastrous tour of Australia, the former captain contributed 56 in Pakistan's first innings of 308 and then played another solid hand in the successful chase for 148 on the fourth day.
Pakistan lost an early wicket and then Yousuf came to the crease at 57-2 after Imran Farhat fell to Graeme Swann for a quickfire 39. The 35-year-old helped Salman Butt (48) put on an invaluable 46 before the captain was also dismissed by the spinner.
Pakistan's nerves showed as Azhar Ali was run out for five, then James Anderson claimed his second wicket as he bowled Yousuf for a patient 33 and Swann trapped Kamran Akmal leg before wicket for a duck without offering a shot.
Umar Akmal (16) and Mohammad Amir (4) then guided Pakistan to a morale-boosting victory following two heavy defeats as their team mirrored the three-wicket win over Australia last month when chasing 180.
"The boys showed a lot of character," Butt told reporters. "It was a very good effort from the whole team, no one individual can be singled out. Yousuf brought class and calmness to the middle order. The dressing room is confident in this holy month of Ramadan, we would like to draw this series 2-2."
The 18-year-old Amir was named man of the match after becoming the youngest player to take five wickets in an innings in England, claiming figures of 5-52 as the hosts were bowled out for 222.
England added just one run to their overnight total before Amir dismissed last man Stuart Broad for six.
