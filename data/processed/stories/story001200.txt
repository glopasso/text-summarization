(EW.com) -- The next step after exposing the world of male strip clubs? Descending into a bordello-themed New Orleans nightclub, naturally.
EW has confirmed that Channing Tatum is developing an hourlong reality pilot for A&E that revolves around Saints & Sinners, a Bourbon Street bar/restaurant that Tatum opened with friend and business partner Keith Kurtz last fall. Tatum and Kurtz will executive produce, as will Original Media's Charlie Corwin.
Saints & Sinners offers "food, spirits, music, and a sinfully good time," according to its website. "Styled after the famous red-light district bordellos and burlesque halls of New Orleans' Storyville era, Saints & Sinners is Tatum's tribute to the city's ribald, good-time reputation."
Expect lots of wrought iron, red accents, and brightly-colored drinks in martini glasses. Just don't count on seeing Tatum's famous abs; it's currently unclear whether the actor will appear in the prospective series.
