Brad Paisley has never shied away from controversial topics in his music: Alcohol helps white people dance. Celebrities can act like fools because people think they're cool. Real guys don't get "manicured, waxed and botoxed."
But he may have gone a step too far at the Country Music Awards Wednesday night and become one of his own song titles: an "accidental racist."
Paisley let viewers know that they wouldn't be seeing the new ABC comedy "Blackâ€¢ish" that evening -- they'd be watching "white-ish." Social media was undecided on whether his dig at country music's predominantly white stars (and predominantly white fan base) was funny or racist.
Paisley also "blew it" by announcing the sex of Carrie Underwood's baby on stage, though we're pretty sure that one was planned. If he's to be believed, Underwood and her husband, hockey player Mike Fisher, are having a boy. And they could potentially name him Garth, after Garth Brooks.
Of course, there were some awards given out during the show as well. Luke Bryan was awarded entertainer of the year.
The reigning power couple of country music, Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert, took home male vocalist and female vocalist of the year. In doing so, Lambert set a record for most consecutive wins in that category.
Little Big Town also wowed viewers with a performance of their hit "Day Drinking" and their light-up outfits -- but surprised no one when they won vocal group of the year.
And "Don't Ya" singer Brett Eldredge took home new artist of the year. Next up for Eldredge will be joining Little Big Town's Pain Killer tour.
