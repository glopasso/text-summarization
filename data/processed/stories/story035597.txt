Pole vault legend Yelena Isinbayeva has announced that she is taking a break from athletics following her poor performance at last month's world indoor championships in Qatar.
The 27-year-old Russian failed to register a height in last year's worlds in Berlin and she followed that up with a fourth-placed finish in Doha, prompting her to make her decision.
In a statement on her official Web site, the reigning Olympic champion revealed that she believes her body is telling her to rest.
"I have been thinking over this very carefully for the last three weeks and have now come to the conclusion that a break from competing is absolutely necessary for me.
"After more than eight years of hard training and competing at the highest levels, indoors and outdoors each year, I need to step back in order for my body to properly recover." Isinbayeva added.
"It is my full intention to continue training and keep myself fit. At this moment I cannot exactly say when I will return to competitions but I have not completely ruled out the entire summer circuit or the European Championships in Barcelona.
"Nothing has changed with my long-term goals which include the 2011 and 2013 world championships and the Olympic gold in London 2012."
