An attack in eastern Afghanistan killed four NATO service members and 12 others Tuesday.
The Czech Defense Ministry said the four soldiers killed were Czech nationals.
The soldiers were patrolling an area in Bagram when a suicide bomber on a bicycle detonated his explosives vest, said Wahid Sediqi, a spokesman for the governor of Parwan province.
In addition to the service members, the blast killed two Afghan police officers and 10 civilians. Eight others, including a child, were wounded, Sediqi said.
The Taliban claimed responsibility.
