The last two inmates who escaped through the ceiling in the shower of the Caddo County Jail in Anadarko, Oklahoma, last month have been captured, Caddo County Sheriff Gene Cain told CNN on Tuesday.
James Mendonca and Triston Cheadle were taken into custody without incident at a private home in Anadarko, he said. Sheriff's deputies acted on a tip received Tuesday morning.
Two other escaped inmates were caught last month.
Dylan Ray Three Irons and Prime Brown were taken into custody in Chickasha, Oklahoma, the sheriff said, less than 20 miles away from the jail. News of the capture first surfaced on Twitter.
The four inmates made a clean getaway October 27 after prying open a maintenance hatch in their shower -- the first escape from the 2-year-old Caddo County jail, Cain said.
They broke a lock on the hatch above the shower head, Cain told CNN affiliate KFOR-TV, and then moved through a crawl space until they reached a wall, where they knocked out concrete block or two. That got them to an unlocked door outside the jail area, Cain explained.
They apparently kept their clothes on in the shower. Four orange inmate uniforms were found outside the jail, CNN affiliate KOCO-TV reported.
Three of the men -- Three Irons, Brown and Mendonca -- had been convicted of methamphetamine offenses and were awaiting transfer to a state prison.
The fourth escapee, Cheadle, was awaiting trial on a federal gun charge, KOCO-TV reported.
