A suspect in the disappearance of a 3-year-old Missouri girl last seen riding her bicycle was in custody Saturday, authorities announced.
Authorities were searching for Breeann Rodriguez's body and bicycle in an undisclosed area in Dunklin County, the Senath Police Department and Dunklin County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
The unnamed suspect is from the area and is not related to the family, according to the statement. He was being held at the Dunklin County Justice Center, pending formal charges.
"There have been hundreds of tips from the public but it was a thorough investigation that led to the suspect," officials said.
They would not comment further Saturday morning, saying the Dunklin County Prosecutor's Office will release more information after the suspect is formally charged.
Police said Thursday that they'd found two training wheels similar to those on a pink bike ridden by Breeann before she went missing.
Senath police Chief Omar Karnes described the training wheels as "items of interest."
The girl was last seen riding August 6 with her brother in front of their home in Senath.
The city, which has about 1,800 residents according to the U.S. Census Bureau, is in southeast Missouri's "bootheel" about 40 miles northeast of Jonesboro, Arkansas, and 90 miles north of Memphis, Tennessee.
A $45,000 reward -- $25,000 from the FBI and $20,000 from the Senath Marshal's office -- was offered for information leading to Breeann's recovery and the prosecution of those responsible.
Authorities said they were no longer interested in tracking down a white cargo van that had been seen in the area days ahead of Breeann's disappearance.
Digital billboards with the girl's picture have been displayed in Jonesboro and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, about 100 miles north of where she went missing.
