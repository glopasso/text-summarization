Championship leader Jorge Lorenzo grabbed pole position for Sunday's Malaysian MotoGP with a record-breaking lap in qualifying at the Sepang International Circuit on Saturday.
The Yamaha rider clocked a time of two minutes 00.334 seconds towards the end of the one-hour qualifying session, breaking the circuit record (two minutes 00.518 seconds) set by Italy's Valentino Rossi three seasons ago.
"I managed to set a new lap time in the last lap with new tyres. Pole position is a very good position but we need to set-up the bike [for Sunday]," the Spaniard said.
