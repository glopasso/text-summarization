(EW.com) -- Having decided that its program could use a few more thongs, the Los Angeles Film Festival announced today that Steven Soderbergh's male-stripper drama "Magic Mike" -- starring Channing Tatum, Matthew McConaughey, Matt Bomer, and a bunch of other guys who look pretty darn good with their shirts off -- will have its world premiere as the festival's closing-night selection.
The festival, now in its 18th year, also unveiled the rest of its line-up. Among the notable movies featured are Woody Allen's ensemble comedy "To Rome With Love" (making its North American premiere as the opening-night film), the apocalyptic Steve Carell-Keira Knightley comedy "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World" (world premiere), the Chris Pine-Elizabeth Banks drama "People Like Us" (world premiere), and Sundance holdovers including "Beasts of the Southern Wild," "Celeste and Jesse Forever," and "Robot & Frank."
The Los Angeles Film Festival runs June 14-24 at the L.A. Live complex in downtown Los Angeles.
