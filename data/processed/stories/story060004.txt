Former "Bachelor" contestant Gia Allemand was hospitalized after suffering "a serious emergency medical event" in New Orleans Monday night, her representative said Tuesday.
Allemand, 29, was listed in critical condition at University Hospital, according to a statement given to CNN.
The representative said details of the medical emergency "are currently not known."
"On behalf of the family, we kindly ask for privacy at this time," the statement said. "Further statements will be released as more information becomes available."
Her mother and long-term boyfriend Ryan Anderson, who plays for the NBA's New Orleans Pelicans, are with her, her rep said.
Allemand appeared on Season 14 of ABC's reality dating competition "The Bachelor," which aired in 2010, opposite commercial airline pilot Jake Pavelka. While she didn't get the final rose, she went on to compete on the first two seasons of the spinoff show "Bachelor Pad."
Allemand's Twitter account describes her as "Christian. Bachelor 14. Bachelor Pad 1 & 2. Pescetarian. Wannabe Poet. Shark Week Enthusiast. Professional Giggler. Pure Barre instructor" from New Orleans.
Her biography calls her an actress, model and reality TV contestant.
