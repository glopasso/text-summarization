A man was arrested Saturday at John F. Kennedy International Airport after checking a loaded rifle and three other illegal weapons, according to a Port Authority spokesperson.
Keenan Draughon of Clarksville, Tennessee, was arrested after he checked two handguns, two defaced rifles and two unloaded high-capacity magazines, according to Port Authority spokesperson Joseph Pentangelo.
In New York City, it is illegal to carry a handgun or possess a high-capacity magazine. Rifles and shotguns are legal to carry if unloaded with a proper permit, according to Pentangelo.
The two rifles were defaced, one with purple paint and the other with silver paint, covering the serial numbers, which is a crime, according to Pentangelo. One rifle was loaded.
Draughon, 23, was stopped and questioned at security before going through metal detectors while trying to board a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina. He had checked the weapons in gun cases at Terminal 8, according to Pentangelo.
Draughon also had a fifth weapon -- a shotgun -- that was legal to travel with, according to Pentangelo.
"It's unusual, but it's not remarkable," Pentangelo told CNN about the case. "Luckily, no one got hurt."
Draughon faces two counts of criminal possession of a weapon, two counts of criminal possession of a defaced rifle and two counts of criminal possession of large-capacity magazine.
Draughon was in custody Saturday. CNN was unable to identify or reach an attorney.
