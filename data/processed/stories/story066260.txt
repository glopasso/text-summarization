Beaten U.S. Open finalist Novak Djokovic believes he can put aside the disappointment of losing to Rafael Nadal in the Flushing Meadows final, to guide Serbia to their first-ever Davis Cup final this weekend.
The 22-year-old told the ATP Tour website that he is fully focussed on helping his nation defeat the Czech Republic in Belgrade.
"I cannot hide the disappointment -- but I'm not gonna cry or complain about that. Of course, I am feeling bad about my loss but I know I gave my maximum to beat Nadal."
World number two Djokovic will open the tie against Radek Stepanek, with the second singles rubber seeing Janko Tipsarevic taking on world number seven Tomas Berdych.
Serbia have beaten the United States and Croatia on their way to the last four whilst the Czech Republic will be looking to reach the final for a second successive year.
Meanwhile, the other semifinal will see nine-times champions France -- who shocked holders Spain in the quarterfinals -- take on Argentina in Lyon.
World number 15 Gael Monfils, who will lead France in the absence of the injured Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, told the official Davis Cup website:  "For an emotional player like me to play in the Davis Cup is just something unbelievable."
Argentina, the beaten finalists in 2006 and 2008, will be looking to claim another away victory after fifth-rubber wins in both Sweden and Russia in their previous two matches.
