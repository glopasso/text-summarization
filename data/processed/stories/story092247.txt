Authorities reopened Interstates 10 and 20 in west Texas on Friday afternoon after crashes in blizzard conditions caused their closure earlier in the day.
Snow plows and crews from the Texas Department of Transportation were still working in the area, DOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said.
"Please drive to conditions and avoid driving if at all possible," she said. "Watch for ice and snow."
Blizzard conditions had hampered efforts to reopen large sections of Interstate 10. Portions of a 240-mile stretch of the interstate were closed in both directions from El Paso to Fort Stockton, Beyer said.
There were several accidents, including a police officer who was hit by a car while trying to get to another accident on Interstate 10. The officer was hospitalized Thursday evening with minor injuries, CNN affiliate KDBC reported.
Heavy snow also caused the closure of U.S. Highway 62/180, east of El Paso to the New Mexico state line.
The National Weather Service forecast fog for Friday night and Saturday in El Paso, Fort Stockton and Odessa, with clear skies by Saturday night.
