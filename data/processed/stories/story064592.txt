A member of the Haqqani Network -- a family whose brutal tactics have helped foment instability in Afghanistan for decades -- is dead in Pakistan.
Nasiruddin Haqqani's bullet-riddled body was found in the Bara Kahu area Sunday night. He had been shot more than 20 times, a senior Pakistani intelligence official told CNN. Police officials confirmed the death.
The eldest son of Haqqani Network founder Jalaluddin Haqqani, Nasiruddin Haqqani was known to be the fund-raiser and intermediary for the militant group. He was also believed to be the spokesman for the Afghan Taliban using the alias Zabiullah Mujahid.
"We have no comment on media reports at this moment," the Afghan Taliban told CNN.
The Haqqani Network is aligned with both the Taliban and al Qaeda. Security experts consider it one of the most significant threats to Afghanistan's stability.
The United States considers it a terrorist group.
The New York Times described the Haqqani Network as "the Sopranos of the Afghanistan War."
Nasiruddin Haqqani's body was taken to his hometown of Miranshah on Monday for burial.
