Arsenal have signed Moroccan international striker Marouane Chamakh from Bordeaux on a free transfer.
Chamakh, 26, joins the London club on a "long-term contract," the English Premier League team said in a statement on its Web site.
His contract with the French club had run out, allowing him to move without a transfer fee.
Chamakh scored 14 goals as Bordeaux ended Lyon's seven-year reign as French champions in 2009 and helped the southwest France club reach the quarterfinals of Europe's Champions League this season.
"Chamakh is a striker of real quality and has all the attributes suited to come to England and do very well," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.
"He is also a fighter, not only a good football player, but a fighter as well. He is very good in the air and also a good team player. He is a great addition to our squad."
Chamakh has scored 27 times in 53 appearances for Morroco and was part of the side which reached the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations final.
"My goal was to join Arsenal out of the all the English clubs because it is a club that makes me dream and I have been a fan since I was a child," said Chamakh.
"We have many great players at Arsenal and I will be giving everything to help the team win trophies next season."
Arsenal finished third in the Premier League last season, and have not won a trophy since the F.A. Cup in 2005.
Club captain Cesc Fabregas has been strongly linked with a move to Spanish champions Barcelona.
