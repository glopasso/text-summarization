Police found the body of a missing fashion designer in the Hudson River Sunday, the New York Police Department said.
Michele Savoia, 55, was last seen leaving a well-known Manhattan club called Marquee around 4 a.m. on Thursday, police said. He had been missing since Friday.
According to police, there is no apparent foul play, and the medical examiner will determine the cause of death.
Savoia's body was found at 1:30 p.m. ET on Sunday in the water near his house boat, which docks at Pier 59 on the west side of Manhattan.
The designer and owner of the boutique House of Savoia has reportedly dressed Robert DeNiro, Matt Dillon and other notables.
According to Savoia's Facebook page, he was from Hoboken, New Jersey, and attended the Fashion Institute of Technology in the 1970s.
Savoia was described as a "tattooed, needle-wielding daredevil" in an article by Fashion Week Daily in 2011.
