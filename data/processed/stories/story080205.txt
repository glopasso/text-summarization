Anne Hathaway will be Tim Burton-ized next month when the eclectic director's "Alice in Wonderland" is released in theaters.
In the new issue of InStyle magazine hitting newsstands Friday, the 27-year-old actress said it was Burton who piqued her interest in playing the deliciously cruel White Queen.
"When I found out Tim Burton was on, I basically went into the studio and said, 'I'm here, I want to play the White Queen.' I'm just letting you know I will do anything to be in this movie."
But that's about as far as the behind-the-scenes planning goes for Hathaway.
"I don't time anything," Hathaway said in the interview. "I never plan an image I want to project. It's always very much where I am right now."
And where she is right now is in a place of total self-acceptance.
"I think I've got really weird features," she told InStyle. "I have very large features on a very small head. But, you know, I'm not going to beat myself up. ... I look like myself, and I think at the end of the day, as nice as pretty is, authenticity is more important."
The actress didn't reveal much about her love life, however, other than she's quite content.
"I'm enjoying myself very, very, very much," she said. "Happiness is a nice feeling."
