The long-time companion of notorious fugitive James "Whitey" Bulger has sold her share of her family's Boston home for $1 to her twin sister, according to registry records.
Catherine Greig, who faces charges of harboring a fugitive, appeared in court July 13 for a detention hearing. The government has 30 days from the hearing day to indict Greig, who is being held without bail.
In an apparent move to protect her assets, Greig sold "all my rights, title and interest" in the house and land in South Boston to Margaret McCusker, according to a filing with the Suffolk Registry of Deeds.
Greig also sought to protect her $343,700 home in Quincy by declaring it covered by the state's Homestead Act, the Boston Globe reported. The house could be safe from creditors as long as she can prove it is her primary residence, the newspaper said.
During Greig's detention hearing, her attorney, Kevin Reddington, told the judge that his client was a "kind, gentle person" who had a "loving personality."
Prosecutors released a series of photographs showing cash, weapons and even a grenade recovered from the Santa Monica, California, apartment that she apparently shared with Bulger for 15 years while he was being hunted by the FBI.
The government also released a brief security camera video of Greig walking in and out of a local drugstore, picking up a prescription, prosecutors said, that was under an assumed name. Bulger and Greig were known in Santa Monica as Charles and Carol Gasko.
Bulger has pleaded not guilty to all counts against him, including his alleged role in 19 murders.
Prosecutors say Bulger was the head of a South Boston Irish gang before he fled an impending racketeering indictment in 1995.
At the same time, he was an FBI informant whose handler tipped him off about the charges. The reputed mobster became the inspiration for the Jack Nicholson character in the 2006 Martin Scorsese film "The Departed."
