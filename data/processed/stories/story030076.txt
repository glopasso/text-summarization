The Navy identified Thursday the two crew members who died when their F/A-18F Super Hornet crashed during a training flight in central California.
The fighter jet, manufactured by Boeing, went down Wednesday afternoon just west of Naval Air Station Lemoore.
Lt. Matthew Ira Lowe, 33, of Plantation, Florida, and Lt. Nathan Hollingsworth Williams, 28, of Oswego, New York, were killed when the plane crashed in a farm field, the air station said in a statement.
Lowe, the pilot, earned the Navy/Marine Corps Achievement Medal and the National Defense Service Medal during his career.
Williams, a naval flight officer who managed the plane's weapons systems, earned the Air Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Sea Service Deployment ribbon and Pistol Marksmanship Medal.
A Navy review board is investigating the incident.
Capt. James Knapp, commanding officer of the station, said the plane and crew were assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron 122.
