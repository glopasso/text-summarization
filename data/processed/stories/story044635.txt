(~CNN)  -- World Cup winners India appointed Duncan Fletcher as their new national coach Wednesday on a two-year deal.
Fletcher succeeds South African Gary Kirsten, who stepped down from the role after guiding the co-hosts to their global triumph earlier this month, beating Sri Lanka in the final.
He will take the reins after India's tour of the West Indies where bowling coach Eric Simmons has been managing team affairs.
The 62-year-old Fletcher coached England from 1999 to 2007, reviving their fortunes in Test cricket.
It culminated in their historic 2-1 Ashes series win over Australia in 2005, but they were thrashed 5-0 by the Aussies on their home soil just 18 months later.
An early exit followed in the 2007 World Cup and Fletcher resigned shortly afterwards.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan, who was in charge for the Ashes  triumph in 2005, has no doubts Fletcher will be a success with India.
"Great coach who will work well with India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni and all the talent," he told his Twitter blog.
But Vaughan sounded a warning about the taciturn Fletcher's relationship with journalists.
"His biggest challenge will come from the media. He has never really understood how it works!," he added.
Fletcher was a former captain of the Zimbabwe one-day international side before turning to coaching.
