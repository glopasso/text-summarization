No one was seriously injured when a U.S. Marine helicopter crashed into the Arabian Sea Monday following training exercises in Djibouti, the U.S. Navy said.
All 25 military members, 17 marines and eight sailors, aboard the Super Stallion chopper were safely recovered from the Gulf of Aden and taken aboard the amphibious transport dock USS Mesa Verde, according a Navy statement.
The helicopter was part of the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit and was attempting to land on the Mesa Verde when the accident occurred, the Navy said.
"The crash was not a result of hostile activity."
"The aircraft was transferring the Marines and Sailors back to USS Mesa Verde from training ashore in nearby Djibouti."
Both the Navy and the Marines are investigating the accident.
