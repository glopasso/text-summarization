Ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak is depressed and refusing to eat as he awaits trial on charges of ordering police to kill anti-government protesters, a state news agency reported Tuesday.
Mubarak is consuming only liquids and juices, is weak and has lost a lot of weight, Mohammed Fathallah, the head of the hospital where the ex-president is being held, told the state-run EgyptNews. Fathallah's deputy, Dr. Asim Azzam, told the agency that the former leader's vital signs were semi-stable.
The 83-year-old Mubarak ruled Egypt for more than 29 years before a popular uprising drove him from office in February. He has been hospitalized since April, after suffering heart palpitations.
Prosecutors have said Mubarak suffers from depression, fatigue, repeated irregular heartbeats, low blood pressure that could lead to fainting and an increased risk of heart attack. His lawyer disclosed in June that the ex-president been struggling with complications from 2010 surgery for stomach cancer.
On July 18, hospital officials reported that Mubarak had fallen into a coma, but one "that did not last long," Fathallah told CNN.
But he is still scheduled to stand trial in August on charges that he ordered police to turn their guns on demonstrators before his ouster -- a charge that carries a possible death sentence. Egyptian officials have said that courts can proceed with a trial if a defendant is in poor health or even on life support.
Mubarak and his two sons are also accused of corruption and misusing state funds. He has denied the charges against him.
