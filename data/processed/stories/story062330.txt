Spain's Nicolas Almagro dashed American qualifier Brian Baker's hopes of a fairytale ATP title triumph in Nice when he beat him in straight sets in the final Saturday.
The third seed successfully defended his title on the French Riviera with a 6-3 6-2 victory in 70 minutes.
"I played my best tennis in two years here," Almagro told the official ATP Tour website.
"I am very happy with my serve and my forehand. I moved on the court very, very well."
Baker has battled back to top form after a succession of injuries and setbacks over the past six years and came into the tournament as world number 216.
His heroics in Nice where he beat a string of higher seeded players will see his ranking boosted ahead of the French Open where both he and Almagro are in action later this week.
Baker matched Almagro to 3-3 in the opening set but he lost the next three games and the second set also proved testing.
"I didn't feel like I played that poorly. I was a little sore and a little tired, but he was definitely the better player," he said.
Almagro feels the 27-year-old Baker has a big future on the ATP Tour.
"He lost the final today, but he is back, he is playing very good. I think if he plays as he did this week, then he will win many, many tournaments."
