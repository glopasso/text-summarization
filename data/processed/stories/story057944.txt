Former South African President Nelson Mandela will remain in a Pretoria hospital through Christmas, the government said on Monday.
In a statement on his website, President Jacob Zuma said that Mandela is responding well to treatment.
"We also humbly invite all freedom loving people around the world to pray for him. He is an ardent fighter and will recover from this episode with all our support,'' said Zuma, who visited Mandela on Saturday.
Mandela, 94, has received round-the-clock care since an acute respiratory infection in 2011. He was hospitalized for a lung infection on December 8; and on December 15, he had successful endoscopic surgery to have gallstones removed.
Mandela has not appeared in public since the 2010 World Cup hosted by South Africa.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner spent 27 years in prison for fighting the oppression of blacks in South Africa. He became the nation's first black president in 1994, four years after he was freed.
South Africa last month launched a new batch of banknotes with a picture of a smiling Mandela on the front.
