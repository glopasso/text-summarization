(PEOPLE.com) -- Talk about a strange New Year's resolution.
Kirstie Alley said she's going to start dating "butt-ugly men" on an episode of "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" airing Friday.
When asked about her dating life by Ellen, Alley, 60, admitted she usually goes for "psychos" and "players," so the host suggested she try going with the opposite of what she's attracted to.
"I'm thinking ugly men might be the solution," the "Dancing with the Stars" alum responded. "I'm talking about butt ugly. Because I go for really handsome men and I think butt ugly would be appreciative."
Alley, who's twice divorced, recently told PEOPLE she's looking for love. What else would she like for her upcoming 61st birthday?
"I want an Aston Martin and a tattoo," she said.
While DeGeneres didn't get the actress a new car, she did help her out with some new ink. The host, who had a tattoo artist waiting backstage, joked that they would play a game to determine Alley's tat. If she lost, the star would have to get a tattoo of DeGeneres.
Luckily, Alley won and was inked with the initials of her two children.
