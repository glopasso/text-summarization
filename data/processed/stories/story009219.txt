The Caribbean is a big place.
For rookies and veterans, it can be tough to know which island to visit and which place to stay.
If deals and perks play into your vacation decision making, the unexpected bonuses at these hotels -- from free kayaking lessons to massages overlooking an underground lake -- might help make up your mind.
$100 resort credit (Westin St. John Resort & Villas, St. John)
At this posh property astride a crescent-shaped beach on Great Cruz Bay, guests who volunteer a few hours of their time can earn a $100 resort credit good at any of the hotel's facilities.
Through a program offered by the Friends of the Virgin Island National Park, interested guests are transported to the nearby park, where they help maintain trails and ruins or pick up debris on the beach.
In return they receive a $100 credit to play with back to the hotel.
