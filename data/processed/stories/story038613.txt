He was once a prized asset chased by a host of Europe's top clubs but after months in the wilderness at Italian giants Inter Milan, Wesley Sneijder has opted to join Turkish club Galatasaray.
The midfielder, who was part of the Netherlands' side that lost the 2010 World Cup final to Spain, has joined the Istanbul-based outfit in a deal thought to be worth around $10 million.
Sneijder, a former Real Madrid player, is due to fly into Istanbul to be paraded in front of the club's notoriously loyal and vociferous fans on Monday.
The 28-year-old last played for Inter back in September and had been linked with English clubs Liverpool and Manchester United, but he has opted for a move to the less regarded Turkish league instead.
In quotes posted on Galatasaray's official Twitter feed Sneijder said: "I am very happy with my agreement with Galatasaray.
"I can't wait to wear the Galatasaray shirt. I know that Turkish people are very passionate about football. I feel in good shape and hope to already play in the next match against Besiktas.
"I heard a lot about Coach Fatih Terim and know his career in Italy well. It will be good to work finally work together. Turkish? I hope to learn it soon."
Sneijder also thanked Inter's fans on his official Twitter page: "Bye Milan, thanks for everything ... Always in my heart! Thanks to all the fans. On my way to Istanbul now ... Excited!"
The club also confirmed the deal had been completed on their Twitter account and their official website, over a week after they agreed a fee with Inter, the 2010 European Champions League winners.
A statement on the Gala Twitter feed read: "An agreement with Inter Milan and Wesley Sneijder for the transfer has been agreed. The conditions of the deal will be made public and the player will sign the contract after health checks.''
