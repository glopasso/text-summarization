Four shootings in less than an hour left three people dead in Omaha, Nebraska, police said.
Two shooting victims were killed, as was one gunman, who was not identified, police said. Two other people were critically wounded.
The shootings all took place in south Omaha on Saturday, the same day the city kicked off the College World Series -- the NCAA championship for baseball.
Officers responded at 2:03 p.m. to the first shooting, which left 31-year-old Aaron Anderson in critical condition, police said.
At 2:23 p.m., police responded to another shooting across town, which critically injured 46-year-old Angel Cabrera.
Four minutes later, officers arrived at the scene of a third shooting. Pascual Bautista-Raymundo, 25, was hospitalized but later died, police said.
Around 2:30 p.m., there was a fourth shooting, in which 25-year-old Anthony Vazzano died. A neighbor followed the suspect and gave police his location.
When officers caught up with the suspect, a gunbattle ensued. Police fatally shot the suspect; no officers were injured.
Omaha police said at a Sunday news conference that it appeared Anderson was targeted and the other shootings were random, CNN affiliate KETV reported.
Police also are looking for the driver of a 1995 Ford Thunderbird who was seen near Anderson's apartment before the shooting, the station said.
