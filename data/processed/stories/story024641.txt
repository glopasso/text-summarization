Something tells us Joan Rivers would laugh about this.
On Friday, the famed comedian, who died September 4 at age 81, appeared to post to her Facebook account, praising the new iPhone 6 and announcing her plans to buy one.
"This badass is being replaced by an iPhone 6 (not the fat one)," someone wrote, in Rivers' trademark irreverent style, in a post that accompanied a photo of an iPhone 4S Friday morning. It was quickly deleted.
Rivers died five days before the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus ("the fat one") were introduced.

It's not unusual for publicists or other representatives of celebrities to post for them on social media. The may have been written earlier and scheduled for release Friday, the day the new iPhones hit stores.
Whoever wrote the post had a little more trouble than just posting as a dead woman about a product she was highly unlikely to have ever seen. In it, "Rivers" writes: "I got this one in 2010, and after 4 years, my only complaint is that apps are now designed for bigger screens, and the battery is getting tired."
The iPhone 4S was released in 2011.
As is usually the case in the Internet age, deleting the post did nothing to keep it from being screen-captured and shared widely on social media, where people had some fun with Rivers, who in later years joked frequently about her own death.
"iPhone is so big, Joan Rivers came back from the dead to endorse it," one Twitter user wrote.
"Joan Rivers talking about the iPhone 6... Maybe The Cloud is more than we think," wrote another.
