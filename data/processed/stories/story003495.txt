Police say the motorcyclist raced through traffic at reckless speeds in San Antonio, Texas, then posted a video to Facebook last week titled "Catch Me If You Can."
It turns out, they could.
Investigators searching for a stolen motorcycle found the man they suspect of being the reckless rider -- Alberto Rodriguez, 27 -- when he ran out the back door of the house, San Antonio Police Sgt. Javier Salazar said Monday.
"It was a coincidence," he said.
Detectives also found the stolen motorcycle, police said in a statement posted on the department's Facebook page.
"Rodriguez faces his currently outstanding felony warrants, a misdemeanor assault warrant, (and) possibly charges in connection with the stolen motorcycle," police said.
The video was posted to the police Facebook page under Rodriguez's name, CNN affiliate KSAT reported. It shows a motorcyclist dangerously cutting through rush hour traffic in San Antonio at speeds of more than 100 mph, according to authorities.
His helmet camera recorded every hair-raising moment as he squeezed between cars and trucks.
Last week, authorities announced that they believed Rodriguez was the motorcyclist.
"Really all it would have taken was a split second for him to impact the lives of several people, possibly killing someone just by his very actions," Salazar told CNN affiliate KSAT last week.
It was not immediately clear whether Rodriguez has retained legal representation.
