(EW.com) -- Hayden Panettiere picks up the mic dropped by Anne Hathaway, the original voice of Little Red Riding Hood in 2005's "Hoodwinked".

Even with SNL's infinitely inventive Bill Hader and Amy Poehler in the H&G vocal roles, the movie can't be saved from its own vices of manic pacing and tediously pro forma pop culture jokes.
EW.com rating: C
