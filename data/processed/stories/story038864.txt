Tour de France race director Christian Prudhomme has confirmed the 2013 race -- the centenary edition -- will start on the French island of Corsica.
Corsica, which lies off the southern French coast, will host the first three stages of the race from Porto-Vecchio to Calvi, the first time the Tour has ever visited.
Prudhomme told AFP: "For the hundredth edition of the race, we wanted to go somewhere new, somewhere spectacular.
"In Corsica, we have all of that. We have everything in place for an enchanting start to the race," he added.
The opening 201.5km stage from Porto-Vecchio to Bastia is likely to favor the sprinters, while the 153km second stage from Bastia to Ajaccio, is expected to see the climbers come to the fore.
The third stage is relatively short, just 145km from Ajaccio to Calvi.
Every French region has hosted a stage of the Tour but the race has never previously crossed over to Corsica, the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, for logistical reasons.
The 2012 Tour de France will begin in the Belgian city of Liege on June 30.
