What do Meat Loaf and the Jacksons have in common? The city of flashy lights. Or Las Vegas, to be more exact.
The Jacksons -- Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon -- will perform 40 shows at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino starting February 20.
"They'll sing their hits, tell unheard stories and take audiences through their career," said event organizer RockTellz & CockTails.
The Jacksons said they're thrilled to be a part of a residency that has featured acts such as Celine Dion and Britney Spears.
"My brothers and I can't wait to take the stage and bring our hits -- and the stories behind them -- to life for the fans," Jackie Jackson said.
Michael Jacksons' brothers are known for big hits such as "I Want You Back" and "I'll Be There."
A week before they start, Meat Loaf will return to perform under the same series as part of his second residency. His show starts February 13.
"For me, the show is more than just another concert ... I'm able to bring together music, acting and theater and do things you can't normally do when you're on the road," Meat Loaf said in a statement . "I get to have a lot of fun and it definitely shows."
Meat Loaf's hits include "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)," "Two Out of Three Ain't Bad " and "Paradise by the Dashboard Light."
His real name is Marvin Lee Aday.
