The boyfriend of a 33-year-old swimsuit designer, whose bruised body was found in a bathtub at an exclusive New York hotel on Thursday, has been charged in her death, officials said.
Nick Brooks, 24, whose father -- Joseph Brooks -- is the Oscar-winning composer and director who produced the song "You Light Up My Life," was charged with attempted murder and strangulation in the death of Sylvie Cachay, police said Friday.
According to CNN affiliate WABC, authorities are treating the death as a homicide. However, Brooks cannot be charged with murder until the medical examiner determines the death was the result of a homicide.
Police discovered Cachay, whose designs had been considered a celebrity favorite, at the Soho House club and hotel, according to a New York police spokesman who declined to be named, citing agency policy.

Brooks was Cachay's boyfriend, according to CNN affiliate WABC.
Cachay's body sustained bruising on the neck and bite marks, and was found clothed in the hotel room bathtub, the spokesman said.
The city medical examiner said Friday the initial autopsy was inconclusive. The office will provide more details surrounding Cachay's death "pending toxicology and tissue testing, which would take a few weeks," said spokeswoman Grace Burgess.
"Sylvie Cachay was one of those rare individuals who truly sparkled when she spoke," said publicist Kate Godici. "She will be deeply and painfully missed, yet celebrated, honored and never forgotten."
The elder Brooks was indicted on multiple counts of sexual assault earlier this year, according to New York Supreme court documents.
The younger Brooks is currently in police custody, the spokesman said.
