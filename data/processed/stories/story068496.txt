A wind of change blew through Hawaii Monday and thankfully it was gentle enough to allow the PGA's Tournament of Champions to finally get under way.
For three days in a row the 30-strong field, all of whom won a PGA Tour event in 2012, had to sit idly by as play was canceled due to strong winds and driving rain.
It led to the bizarre sight of Rickie Fowler officially starting the new campaign three times, after his first two attempts were derailed by the weather.
But once the action began Dustin Johnson's detailed preparation for the competition showed, as his six practice rounds prior to teeing off in Maui helped him shoot rounds of 69 and 66 to lead on 11-under-par.
The U.S. Ryder Cup star leads by three shots from fellow countryman Steve Stricker, with 2012 Masters champion Bubba Watson a further shot back.
