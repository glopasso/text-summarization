NBC has also confirmed the widespread rumor that Kanye West will make his fifth appearance as the show's musical guest on the May 18 episode, though it remains unclear whether the rapper, who has been in Paris working on his next album, will premiere any new music.
Vampire Weekend will provide the tunes during Wiig's hosting gig.
Both Wiig and Affleck have a busy few months ahead.
