Authorities warned residents not to drink water that appears or tastes unusual. They were distributing tens of thousands of bottles of water, along with meals, in the Draguignan area, the prefecture said.
More local thunderstorms were forecast for Thursday afternoon and evening, the prefecture said.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy was expected to visit the stricken areas next week, authorities said.
The flooding, which began Tuesday, forced 2,000 people into shelters, officials said Thursday. Some 1,200 firefighters and 650 police officers have taken part in the rescue effort, the prefecture said. More than 1,400 people have been rescued by helicopter and 100 have been rescued by boat.
The flooding also forced French authorities to transfer more than 400 inmates at Draguignan prison to other prisons in the south of France.
Var includes the Cote d'Azur, a popular tourist destination along the French Riviera.
