An arrest has been made in the stabbing death of a man who was apparently killed in an argument stemming from a long and intense West Coast baseball rivalry.
A few hours after the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants played at AT&T Park in San Francisco on Wednesday night, a man wearing Dodgers gear was stabbed and killed in a fight. It happened just a few blocks from the stadium, authorities said.
The victim was identified as Jonathan Denver, 24, the son of a Dodgers security guard.
Michael Montgomery, 21, of Lodi, California, has been charged with one count of homicide, San Francisco police said Thursday.
It's not clear how the fight started. Police say the suspect was part of a group that wasn't at the game. The Giants defeated the Dodgers 6-4 in the Wednesday night game.
"The fact that anybody got into any sort of beef over the Giants and the Dodgers and somebody lost their life," San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said. "It's just senseless."
In a prepared statement, the Giants called the incident "horrific." The club held a moment of silence for Denver before a Thursday night game, and police bulked up security.
A Dodgers statement said "the pain that this has caused his family and friends is unimaginable."
The 91-68 and playoffs-bound Dodgers have had a successful year, clinching the National League West. The disappointing Giants, who won last year's World Series, are next to last in the West with a 74-85 record.
