(CNN)Suzanne Crough, the child actress who portrayed youngest daughter Tracy on the '70s musical sitcom "The Partridge Family," has died. She was 52.
Crough passed away Monday at home in Laughlin, Nevada, the Clark County Coroner's Office said.
Tracy played tambourine and percussion in the traveling "Partridge Family" band. The group consisted of a widowed mom, played by Shirley Jones, and her five children, played by David Cassidy, Susan Dey, Danny Bonaduce, Brian Forster and Crough. Band manager Reuben Kincaid, played by Dave Madden, rounded out the cast.
The band had real hit songs with "Come On Get Happy" and "I Think I Love You," though not all the members really sang or played instruments.
The show aired from 1970-74.

Redheaded Crough was raised in Los Angeles, the youngest of eight children, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Crough also starred in the TV series "Mulligan's Stew" and had spots on other series in the '70s.
She appeared in a "Partridge Family" reunion on the "Today" show in 2010.
"I'm an office manager for Office Max," she told host Matt Lauer. "I have two daughters, I'm married, I have a normal job."
