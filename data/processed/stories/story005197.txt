Welcome to New York City. Hope you packed your appetite.
We're not claiming these are the definitive "best," "most essential," or "most authentic" restaurants in all of NYC or any of that jazz. We are just saying that if it were us in town for a few days, these are the places we'd make a beeline for to eat, drink and generally be delighted.
Not a fan of our faves? Well, OK then. Just send us a DM or a note @eatocracy on Twitter, let us know where you are, and we'll find you some food to suit your mood.
Have a delicious stay.
