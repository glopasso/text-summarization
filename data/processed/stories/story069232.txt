A woman was found guilty of murder Tuesday for repeatedly stabbing a Texas college professor with the heel of her stiletto.
Ana Trujillo showed little emotion as the verdict was announced. She now faces up to life in prison for the June 2013 death of her boyfriend, Alf Stefan Andersson, CNN affiliate KPRC reported.
The affiliate said Trujillo stabbed Andersson more than 25 times.
The defense argued that prosecutors had failed to show motive and that Trujillo was a victim of domestic violence, KPRC said. Prosecutors reportedly told jurors that she made up the story that she had acted in self defense.
According to CNN affiliate KTRK, when police arrived at Andersson's apartment, Trujillo, who had recently worked as a massage therapist, answered the door with blood on her clothes and hands; Andersson was lying in the hallway face up, with a stiletto by his head, KTRK reported, citing court records.
Trujillo had recently moved in with Andersson, and she told investigators that he grabbed her, and a struggle followed, said KTRK.
Andersson was a full-time research professor at the University of Houston's Center for Nuclear Receptor and Cell Signaling.
In a statement last year, the school said it was "saddened to learn of the tragic death of Professor Stefan Andersson. Our hearts go out to his colleagues, family and friends during this difficult time."
