Former Brazil international captain Socrates has died in a Sao Paolo hospital at the age of 57 following an intestinal infection.
The cultured midfielder, who won 60 international caps and scored 22 goals for his country, was admitted to the Albert Einstein hospital on Friday after suffering from food poisoning and died early on Sunday morning after going into septic shock.
Socrates had already been admitted to hospital twice in 2011, in August and September, because of bleeding in his digestive tract.
Despite not turning professional until he was 24, Socrates starred for Brazil between 1979 and 1986, playing in two World Cup finals tournaments in the process.
However, he will always be associated with the brilliant 1982 Brazilian side, who are widely regarding as the greatest team to never win the World Cup.
Socrates captained the 1982 side in Spain and was widely expected to lift the World Cup trophy. However, they were beaten 3-2 by Italy in the second group phase in one of football's most iconic matches.
He also played 297 matches, scoring 172 goals, in six years with Corinthians and the Brazilian side paid tribute to him on their official website.
"We can always be thankful for having witnessed one of the greatest ever footballers.
"Thank you for the beautiful goals, the graceful touches and the skilful football that only Socrates possessed."
Another former Corinthians and Brazil star Ronaldo also paid tribute to Socrates on his Twitter feed, saying: "The day has begun in sad fashion. Rest in peace Dr. Socrates."
