A suspect in the death of a transgender woman in New Jersey has turned himself in, authorities said, and a second suspect remains at large.
Marquise L. Foster, 25, surrendered to Essex County officials Saturday night. Authorities are searching for Alrashim N. Chambers, 23, of Newark.
The two are suspects in the killing of Victoria Carmen White, 28, of Newark, who was fatally shot on September 12 at an apartment in Maplewood, police said in a statement. Maplewood is a half-hour drive west of New York City.
Foster and Chambers met the victim at a nightclub and returned with her and two other people to the apartment, police said.
White was killed after an altercation at the apartment, authorities said.
Last week, after police announced the arrest of a suspect in the March killing of an openly gay man in Maplewood, authorities said sexual orientation could be a factor in both killings.
John Staten, 30, is accused in the March killing of Arthur Downey, 27, who was found beaten to death in bed in his Maplewood apartment.
"What the prosecutor said today is their sexual orientation may have been a factor in their deaths," Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County prosecutor, said last week.
Arthur Downey, 27, was openly gay, Carter said.
"We have a special unit that looks at cases to determine whether there is a legal basis to bring bias-crime charges, and that unit within our office will be reviewing both of these cases."
Garden State Equality, a gay rights organization, decried the attacks and announced a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of the suspects in White's murder.
