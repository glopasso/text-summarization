Authorities are on the hunt for a suspected serial bank robber after he struck again this month after a nearly two-year hiatus.
The suspect is said to have held up the First Nebraska Bank in Nebraska City, Nebraska, on August 22. He's wanted in connection to a string of other robberies -- in Idaho, Washington and California in 2012 -- including one where he shot a police officer.
"We want to make everybody aware of how violent this individual is. He's not afraid to pull the trigger. He's already shot a police officer, so anybody who gives him any resistance, he's not afraid to act," Detective Carlos Dominguez, with the Chino, California, police department, told reporters Sunday.
The suspect, dubbed the "AK-47 Bandit," stormed the bank in Nebraska with an assault style rifle and a black duffel bag, according to the FBI. He emptied the front drawers before ordering all employees to the vault area. He told one to take money from the safe.
Authorities have linked him to the other robberies because of certain similarities, said FBI Omaha Special Agent in Charge Thomas Metz.
The suspect carries a weapon that appears to be an AK-47, or something similar. He has distinct blue eyes, wears a black mask, a ballistic vest and gloves. He's believed to be white, about 5 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs somewhere between 175 and 200 pounds.
There is a $100,000 reward for information leading to his capture.
