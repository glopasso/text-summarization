William Ginsburg, an attorney who represented former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, died Monday at age 70, his family confirmed to CNN.
Ginsburg died at home in Los Angeles from complications of cancer, his family said Wednesday.
The attorney was known for being one of the first people to appear on all five major Sunday news talk shows on a single day during the Lewinsky scandal in the late 1990s, after the intern admitted to sexual activities with then-President Bill Clinton.
Involved in the legal community for more than 45 years, Ginsburg also was involved in right-to-die cases in California and the dispute over the remains of musician Liberace, according to a statement his family released. He was passionate about constitutional law and frequently spoke to legal and medical associations, his family said.
Ginsburg was a national board member and president and trustee of the American Board of Trial Advocates Foundation, which provides education concerning the history and value of the right to trial by jury, his family said. He was also active in several other groups and foundations.
The attorney tried more than 300 cases in 21 states, his family said, before retiring from his litigation practice in 2009 to focus full-time on his mediation and arbitration practice.
