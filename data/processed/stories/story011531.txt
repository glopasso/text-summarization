Dutch international Wesley Sneijder scored twice as Inter Milan continued their renaissance in Serie A by beating Udinese 3-1, keeping alive the Italian side's chances of European Champions League qualification.
Sneijder's brace turned Wednesday's match after Udinese had taken an early lead through Danilo, then midfielder Ricardo Alvarez scored at the end of the first half to all but seal the win for Inter.
The result means that the Nerazzurri have been undefeated -- winning three matches and drawing two -- since youth team coach Andrea Stramaccioni replaced Claudio Ranieri earlier this month.
Champions League football was but a distant dream for Inter, but 11 points from a possible 15 has left the 2010 European title winners sixth in the table -- just three points off third-placed Lazio, who surprisingly lost 2-1 to relegation-threatened Novara earlier in the day.
The unusually timed round of matches took place Wednesday afternoon, a rescheduling of the games canceled as a mark of respect for Livorno's Piermario Morosini, who collapsed and died during a second division game at Pescara.
Unbeaten Juventus remained three points clear of defending champions with four matches to play after both teams won narrowly against lowly opposition.
Juve, seeking a first Serie A title since 2003 and 28th overall, condemned bottom club Cesena to division two next season thanks to a late goal from striker Marco Borriello -- his first since joining on loan from Roma in January.
Borriello's goal came with 11 minutes to play -- and Kevin Prince-Boateng's winner for Milan came even later at home to fourth-bottom Genoa.
Napoli, also chasing a Champions League spot, beat Lecce 2-0 to move up to fourth above Udinese -- who will be Sunday's opponents.
Roma lost again, this time 2-1 at home to Fiorentina to be two points behind Inter.
In the day's two other games Siena drew 1-1 with Bologna while Parma won 2-1 away at Palermo.
