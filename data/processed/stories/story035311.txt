New Yorkers can calm down now. Your president has spoken.
Billy Joel recently defended the selection of Taylor Swift as tourism ambassador for New York City. The "New York State of Mind" singer told USA Today that folks need to lighten up.
"I see the New York press going, 'Taylor Swift is going to be the new New York representative?'" Joel said. "You snoots. Let her in. That's what New York is all about. I say, 'Welcome.'"
Better NYC ambassadors than Taylor Swift
Swift is a recent transplant to the Big Apple and her latest hit album, "1989," features the single "Welcome to New York" as an ode to her new town. Fellow music scribe and die-hard New Yorker Joel further expressed his admiration for Swift.
"I think she's a talented songwriter," he said. "She catches a lot of junk, maybe because she's so popular with young girls. But I like what she's projecting. I respect what she's doing."
