Might there be a spinoff of "19 Kids and Counting"?
Although their wedding has yet to air on that popular TLC show, Jill Duggar and new husband Derick Dillard have revealed to People magazine that they are expecting. The baby is a first for the pair, who married June 21 in Springdale, Arkansas.
"We are so excited," said Jill Duggar, who now goes by Jill Dillard.
The 23-year-old and her 25-year-old husband met when her father introduced the pair.
Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar have 19 children. The Duggars' religious beliefs dictate chaperoned courtship and waiting till marriage for the first kiss.
The pair texted and Skyped under parental supervision during their courtship while Dillard served as a missionary in Nepal. They announced their engagement in April, and fans will get to see their wedding on the show when the new season starts on September 2.
Dillard said he and his bride were surprised when a home pregnancy test confirmed their good news.
"It was surreal," he said. "We were shocked. Both of us are so excited."
Although Jill is the Duggars' first daughter to marry, this baby won't be the first grandchild for the Duggars. Son Josh and daughter-in-law Anna are already the parents of three. In August, they announced that daughter Jessa was engaged to Ben Seewald.
