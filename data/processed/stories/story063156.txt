A Moroccan court on Friday sentenced to death Adil Othmani, the main suspect in a terrorist attack in Marrakech last spring, Morocco's state news agency, Maghreb Arabe Presse, reported.
Othmani was held responsible for an explosion that tore through a cafe April 28, killing 17 people and wounding 20 others.
The blast occurred at Cafe Argana in Place Jemaa el Fna, a bazaar and square popular among tourists.
Moroccan authorities said the bomber remotely triggered two explosives, which he had placed there while disguised as a Western hippie.
A Moroccan Ministry of Justice official who refused to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the case confirmed that a death sentence has been handed down to the mastermind of the bombing, the news agency reported.
Another man, Hakim Dah, was sentenced to life in prison; defendants Abdssamad Bettar, Azzedine Lachdari, Ibrahim Cherkaoui and Skiribia Wadia were each given sentences of four years in prison; Mohammed Reda, Amhinni Mohammed, Dehhaj Abdelfattah were given three years each.
