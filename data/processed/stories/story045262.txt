Mark Webber's second place behind Red Bull teammate Sebastian Vettel in the Japanese Grand Prix sees the Australian stretch his lead in the world title race to 14 points.
Fernando Alonso of Ferrari is also still in the championship race after finishing third at Suzuka, but Germany's Vettel has drawn level on points with him after his superb victory.
Alonso keeps second place by virtue of races won, but with three rounds to go the challenge from Red Bull looks ominous.
Lewis Hamilton could only finish fifth for McLaren after gearbox problems and has slipped to fourth in the standings, just ahead of reigning world champion and teammate Jenson Button, who claimed fourth.
The title race is between the leading five, but Button is now 31 points adrift and his hopes of a successful defense look to be receding.
Red Bull have also strengthened their advantage of McLaren in the constructors' championship with Ferrari in third.
The 17th round is being held in Seoul, South Korea, the first F1 race at the new track.
