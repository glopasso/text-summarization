Greek journalists walked off the job Thursday to protest tough government austerity measures.
The reporters are specifically protesting reforms to the country's social security system as called for in the austerity package the government has put together to pull Greece out of debt.
Participating in the strike is the Athens News Agency, the national news outlet.
During the strike -- which ends Friday morning -- television and radio stations will not broadcast programs, the news agency said.
Friday morning papers will also go unprinted.
The country has already experienced walkouts by workers' unions in recent weeks.
In May, a €110 billion ($145 billion) aid package for Greece was announced. Soon after, Greece's Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou announced tough cost-cutting measures to meet European Union and International Monetary Fund conditions on the deal.
The package includes a promise by Greece to cut its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product, as required by European Union rules, by 2014, according to Papaconstantinou.
The measures, he said, were needed for Greece to secure its financial lifeline.
Greece had a choice between "destruction" and saving the country, and "we have chosen of course to save the country," Papaconstantinou said.
