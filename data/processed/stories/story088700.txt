WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- The FBI has hit a dead end in its search for a missing 3-year-old Arkansas boy and is asking the public for help.
The FBI is hoping the public can help find 3-year-old Dominick Wesley Arceneaux.
Dominick Wesley Arceneaux was last seen by an aunt Tuesday afternoon in the front yard of a mobile home in Chidester, in south-central Arkansas, authorities said.
In a missing-person alert, the FBI described Dominick as 3 feet tall, weighing 38 pounds, with brown hair and eyes.
Kimberly Brunell, a special agent with the FBI in Little Rock, said authorities have made "an exhaustive search" of White Oak Lake, close to where the boy was last seen.
National Guardsmen have also done a grid search covering a one-mile radius around the home, she said, and are currently expanding it to a two-mile radius.
Investigators also have looked at registered sex offenders in the area, Brunell said. They have also found Dominick's father, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
"We have not ruled anyone out at this point," she said.
The investigation has included looking at patrons of a bar next to the mobile home where Dominick has lived with his mother since December, she said. "There is not the normal traffic of just neighbors."
Brunell said investigators have run down every lead and are looking for new ones, including "suspicious vehicles, suspicious persons ... anyone who might have a nugget that might lead us on our way to finding out what happened to him."
Anyone with more information is asked to call an FBI hot line, 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324).
