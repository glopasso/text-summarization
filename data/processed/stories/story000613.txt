Defending Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic has been named as the top men's seed for this year's tournament, with French Open winner Maria Sharapova heading the women's singles seedings.
World number one Djokovic retains the top seeding at the All England Club despite his defeat to Rafael Nadal in the French Open final earlier this month.
The Spaniard is seeded second ahead of six-time champion Roger Federer, who is seeking a first grand slam win since the 2010 Australian Open.
Great Britain's Andy Murray, a losing semifinalist for the last three years, is seeded fourth.
However, the Scot's preparations suffered a blow on Wednesday when he was beaten by Janko Tipsarevic at The Boodles exhibition tournament in Buckinghamshire.
It was Murray's second successive defeat on grass, following his surprise early exit from the Aegon Championships at Queen's Club last week.
France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who suffered an injury scare when he injured a finger at the Aegon Championships, is seeded fifth for Wimbledon.
He will not be joined by fellow Frenchman Gael Monfils as the world number 15 has failed to recover from a knee injury in time for the championships.
The Wimbledon women's singles seedings reflect the current WTA Tour rankings, with world number one Sharapova selected top.
She is followed by world number two Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska, with reigning Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova seeded fourth.
Australia's Sam Stosur is the fifth seed, with four-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams seeded sixth.
Meanwhile, two-time Wimbledon champion Nadal was named as the flag carrier for Spain at the London 2012 Olympics on Wednesday.
Sharapova and Djokovic were handed similar roles for Russia and Serbia respectively earlier this month.
