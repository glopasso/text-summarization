The British tourist who was struck by a New York City taxi after it jumped a curb had her left leg amputated below the knee, hospital officials said Thursday.
Sian Green, 23, was at 49th Street and Sixth Avenue -- home to Rockefeller Center and near Radio City Music Hall and Saks Fifth Avenue -- Tuesday morning when she and a bicyclist were both hit by the cab after the driver swerved onto the curb, authorities said.
Given the condition of the lower leg, "replantation was not an option," according to Dr. Spiros G. Frangos of Bellevue Hospital.
Green's right leg sustained multiple injuries but will likely regain most functionality with time and physical therapy, the trauma surgeon said in a statement.
Green's parents released a statement on Thursday, expressing their gratitude to all those that helped during this "difficult time."
"We hope Sian will soon be on her way to recovery and will be able to personally thank all the kind people of New York City," they said.
TV's Dr. Mehmet Oz, host of "The Dr. Oz Show," was nearby at the time of the accident and rushed over to assist, according to show rep Tim Sullivan.
A good Samaritan walking by also aided Green. "David Justino, a plumber from New York, took action, removing his belt and using it as a tourniquet," Oz said in a Facebook post.
As of Thursday, the cab driver did not face criminal charges, police said.
