The Atlanta Braves are one step closer to moving away from Atlanta.
A crucial vote passed Tuesday night, which directs $300 million in taxpayer dollars to the development, and paves the way for the Braves move from downtown Atlanta to the northern suburbs, the Cobb County Commission said.
This vote comes just two weeks and a day after the Braves made the stunning announcement that the team was moving from downtown Atlanta.
At that time, the team said that beginning in 2017, it will no longer play at Turner Field. It is building a new stadium in Cobb County up the highway to the northwest, where two major interstates -- I-75 and I-285 -- meet.
"We are extremely excited that our address will still be Atlanta and so will the name across our jersey," the team said in an announcement. The location is just outside Atlanta's city limits.
He vowed the new stadium site "will be one of the most magnificent in all of baseball. It will thrive with action 365 days a year."
The Braves say the stadium will cost $672 million to build.
Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed had said he tried to negotiate with the Braves to keep them in Atlanta, but ultimately the price became too high.
"We are simply unwilling to match that with taxpayer dollars," Reed said. "So we wish the Braves well knowing the city of Atlanta has much to be proud of."
