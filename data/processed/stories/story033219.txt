A Honduran beauty queen has disappeared days before the start of the Miss World pageant.
Investigators are searching for Miss Honduras World María José Alvarado Muñoz and her sister, who went missing on Thursday, police in the Central American country said Sunday. Family members reported their disappearance on Saturday, police said.
Eduardo Zablah, director of the pageant in Honduras, told CNN affiliate Televicentro that the sisters were last seen getting into a vehicle after attending a party last week.
Contestants from more than 120 countries are scheduled to start arriving in London this week for early rounds of the Miss World pageant. They'll face off in a final round on December 14.
Alvarado, a 19-year-old student from Santa Bárbara, Honduras, describes herself as an aspiring diplomat who enjoys playing volleyball and soccer in her spare time, according to a profile of her on the pageant's website.
She beat 18 contestants to win the Miss World Honduras crown in April.
