A 10-year-old boy turned the tables and scared off armed intruders who forced their way into his Brooklyn home, according to police.
Surveillance video released by police shows someone in the house on Monday afternoon opening the door for a man wearing a FedEx uniform, followed by another man.
Police say the two men were armed, and upon making their way into the house, demanded money from the nine people inside.
When one of the alleged intruders went upstairs, someone was able to close the door on his arm, making him drop his gun.
The boy picked up the gun and fired once, police said. The armed suspect fired back, before both men fled the scene empty-handed.
Both bullets missed, and there were no injuries, but the two assailants were still at large Tuesday; the investigation is ongoing.
Tuesday, there was a letter on the door of the home asking for reporters to give the residents privacy.
"Many of the victims are minors and are all traumatized on what occurred yesterday. We just want to continue with our daily routines."
