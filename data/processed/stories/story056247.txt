A strong earthquake with magnitude 6.5 struck Friday night in the ocean southwest of Sumatra in Indonesia, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
The quake, which occurred shortly after 11 p.m., was centered about 100 miles (165 kilometers) west of Bengkulu in Sumatra, and 215 miles (345 kilometers) south of Padang, Sumatra, the USGS said.
The center was 13.7 miles (22 kilometers) deep, the USGS said.
There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center did not issue a warning after the quake, but said there was a "very small possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts" no more than 62 miles (100 kilometers) from the earthquake's epicenter.
"Authorities in the region near the epicenter should be made aware of this possibility," it said.  The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysics Agency also did not issue a tsunami warning.
