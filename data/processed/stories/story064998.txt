(Mashable) -- Rovio CEO Mikael Hed says the immensely popular "Angry Birds" game is coming to Facebook next month with "completely new aspects to it that just haven't been experienced in any other platform."
According to "All Facebook," Hed used the word "collaborative" to describe aspects of the game, adding that "the pigs will have a more prominent role."
Take a look at the "Angry Birds" page on Facebook, and you'll see that something is up. If you "like" the page, Rovio promises to keep you posted on all the latest news about the upcoming "Angry Birds" migration to Facebook.
Other game developers must be envious of the meteoric rise of "Angry Birds." First it starts out as an iPhone game, then it's ported to Android, Palm and Nokia, then suddenly there are multiple versions of the game, and it's showing up on PCs, PSP/PS3, Windows 7 Phone, there's a movie tie-in, an animated series, and there's even a 3D version in the works. And next month we'll be playing it on the largest social network in the world.
Please tell us in the comments how you think "Angry Birds" will do on Facebook, and what you think that collaborative aspect of the game might be.
