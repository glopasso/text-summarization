Barcelona confirmed on Saturday the transfer of Arsenal midfielder Alex Song for $23.5 million, subject to a medical.
"FC Barcelona has agreed a deal with Arsenal FC for the transfer of Alex Song to the Camp Nou. The fee is 19 million euros," declared a statement on the club website.
"The Cameroon international midfielder will sign for the next five seasons with a release clause of 80 million euros," the statement added.
Song is scheduled to have a medical in Spain on Monday before being officially presented on Tuesday.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger explaiend the club's decision to sell song after his side's 0-0 draw with Sunderland.
"We have Wilshere coming back, I believe in one and a half months. We have Diaby back, we have Rosicky not far away and we might bring another midfielder in as well," he told the club website.
"Song expressed a desire to go to Barcelona."
Song is the second member of the Arsenal first team to leave the club this week after last season's top scorer Robin Van Persie moved to Manchester United on Friday.
