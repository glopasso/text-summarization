Bob and Mike Bryan won a third Wimbledon men's doubles champions on Saturday to complete a Golden Slam following their success at last year's Olympics.
The 3-6 6-3 6-4 6-4 win over the 12th seeds Ivan Dodig and Marcelo Melo means that the American twins now hold all four major titles -- the first male doubles pairing ever to do so in the open era -- and the Olympic title.
"I didn't think anything could feel as sweet as the gold medal, but this one just feels like there's a cap, a lid, or a ribbon around our career. It's pretty cool," Mike Bryan said.
"It's something we never dreamed of, to try to win four in a row. It's too hard to dominate in doubles," he added.
"Maybe we had a little luck involved along the way. We just took one at a time. It just added up. Now we got to try to suit back up for the calendar Slam. I don't even want to think about that."
The quest for the Golden Slam didn't get off to the best start with Dodig and Melo racing into a 4-0 lead, before finally taking the first set 6-3.
But the Bryans found their form early in the second, breaking the Dodig serve in the second game before taking the set 6-3.
A solitary break of serve was all that was needed in the remaining two sets with the Bryan's eventually easing to victory in one hour 58 minutes.
The win takes the brothers' tally of tour titles to nine for the season and a career total of 91.
In the women's doubles final, eighth seeds Su-Wei Hsieh and Shuai Peng beat the 12th seeds Ashleigh Barty and Casey Dellacqua of Australia 7-6 6-1.
