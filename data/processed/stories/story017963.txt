HBO execs say they have nothing to worry about with "Game of Thrones" -- and not just because it's the most-nominated program at the Emmys this year.
The fantasy series is based on George R.R. Martin's "A Song of Ice and Fire" book series, and as "Game of Thrones" approaches its fifth season, fans are concerned it'll soon run out of source material.
But on Thursday, HBO CEO Richard Plepler and network Programming President Michael Lombardo assured reporters at the Television Critics Association press tour that "Game of Thrones" will get its fully story.
"George is an integral part of the creative team, so next season every move is being choreographed very closely with him," Lombardo said. "Certainly after next year we'll have to figure it out with George, but we're not concerned about it."
A rumored "Game of Thrones" movie isn't on the radar, but Plepler wouldn't dismiss it entirely. "In my conversations with George, he's 100% focused on the books and the show," the HBO CEO said.
"GOT" is HBO's most-watched series (ever), but "True Detective" is its newest gem. On Thursday, the freshman anthology series earned 12 Emmy nods, including nominations for best drama, best writing and two best actor nods for Season 1 stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.
The show's structure presents a new cast of characters and story each season, and while Lombardo didn't have any casting news on Thursday he did drop a major tease for Season 2.
"The two scripts we have are -- I hate to jinx it -- but they are more exciting than the first season," he promised.
"True Detective" creator Nic Pizzolatto was just as cryptic with The Daily Beast, saying little except that it will be set in California, and there are four central roles.
"We're not keeping any secrets, so when something concrete develops, we'll announce it to everybody," Pizzolatto said. "But everything has just been empty rumors so far."
