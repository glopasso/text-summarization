MADRID, Spain -- Raul Tamudo is back in Spain's squad to travel to Denmark for a Euro 2008 Group F qualifier on Saturday.
Raul Tamudo has not featured for Spain since 2005
The Espanyol captain has been recalled by coach Luis Aragones to replace injured striker David Villa.
He is preferred to Real Madrid captain Raul, who has been out of the national side for a year, but has played a key role in Real Madrid's excellent start to their league campaign.
The 29-year-old Tamudo has earned nine caps for the national side, but his last appearance came against Serbia and Montenegro in a World Cup qualifier more than two years ago.
Villa injured his left ankle during Valencia's 2-1 home loss against Espanyol at the weekend, and will be out of action for three weeks.
Spain lead the group, three points ahead of Northern Ireland and Sweden. Denmark are fourth, five points back but with two games in hand on the Spaniards.
Spain will also play a friendly against Finland on October 17.
