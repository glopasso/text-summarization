The Cameroon Football Federation has appointed veteran Spaniard Javier Clemente as the coach of the African country's national team.
The 60-year-old, who has previous international experience with Spain and Serbia, returns to management after a short stint at relegated La Liga club Real Valladolid at the end of last season.
He replaces Frenchman Paul Le Guen, who stepped down from the role after Cameroon lost all three matches at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Clemente becomes Cameroon's fourth coach since May 2009, with German Otto Pfister and Thomas Nkono having also been charge in that time, and will sign a two-year contract.
"Javier Clemente is the new coach of Cameroon. The signing of the contract will take place in Yaounde on August 28," read a statement on the Cameroon federation's official website on Tuesday.
"In his role, he will also be assisted by Francois Omam-Biyik. The former Indomitable Lion will serve as assistant coach.
"Jacques Songo'o, who served alongside Paul Le Guen as assistant coach in charge of goalkeepers during the World Cup, keeps his post."
Clemente, whose playing career was cut short by injury in 1971, started coaching four years later and has been in charge of clubs such as Athletic Bilbao (three times), Espanyol (twice), Marseille, Real Sociedad and Real Betis.
He coached Spain between 1992-98, going to two World Cups and Euro 96, but lasted less than two years with Serbia.
His first task will be to help the Indomitable Lions to qualify for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.
Four-times champions Cameroon's first game is next month away to Mauritius, with Senegal and Congo Democratic Republic also in Group E.
