The mother of a missing toddler on Monday was arrested in connection with an alleged theft from one of her friends, Florida authorities said.
Monday's arrest of Casey Anthony, mother of missing 3-year-old Caylee Anthony, was her second relating to the theft case and her third since the child disappeared three months ago.
The latest charges -- passing a forged check, fraudulent use of personal identification and petty theft, according to an arrest affidavit released by the Orange County Sheriff's Office -- related to a theft from Casey Anthony's friend Amy Huizenga, authorities said.

Caylee disappeared in mid-June, and her mother waited nearly a month before reporting the disappearance, authorities said. Since then, evidence has mounted that Caylee is dead, authorities said.
Anthony was first arrested on July 16 after she told detectives lies about her daughter's disappearance, according to police.
She was charged with child neglect, making false official statements and obstructing a criminal investigation.
While out on bail, Anthony on August 29 was arrested on suspicion of forgery, fraudulent use of personal information and petty theft related to the Huizenga case.
She remained in jail until early September, when her $500,000 bail was posted anonymously.
Police have labeled Anthony a "person of interest" in the case of her missing daughter.
Anthony initially said she didn't immediately report her daughter missing because she was conducting her own investigation.
Later, she told police she gave Caylee to a baby sitter. But investigators said they soon learned that the address she gave them was an apartment that hadn't been occupied for months.
