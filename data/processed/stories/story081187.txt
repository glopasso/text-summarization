Three inmates were shot and wounded by guards Friday during an escape attempt at a Livingston, Texas, prison, officials said.
The incident started about 9 p.m. (10 p.m. ET) when inmates were leaving a church service at a gymnasium in the prison, said Jason Clark, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
While walking back from the church service, five inmates jumped an interior fence in an attempt to flee, officials said.
Guards opened fire, wounding three of the inmates. All five were captured and the wounded inmates were taken to a hospital, Clark said.
