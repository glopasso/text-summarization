Tropical Storm Bret is expected to strengthen as it moves away from the Bahamas and out to sea, the National Hurricane Center said Monday.
As of 2 p.m., Bret -- the second tropical storm of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season -- was about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Great Abaco Island, according to the hurricane center. The storm had been about 65 miles (105) from the island earlier Monday.
The storm is drifting to the north-northeast and is expected to pick up speed and strength as it moves away from land, according to forecasters.
Grand Bahama Island and the Abaco Islands in the northwest Bahamas nevertheless remained under a tropical storm warning Monday. Bret could dump 2 to 4 inches of rain in the northwest Bahamas.
The storm had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (85 kph) Monday afternoon, with higher gusts.
