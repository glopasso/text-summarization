(CNN)Mr. Grey will see you now. Just not in Kenya.
The erotic movie "Fifty Shades of Grey" is out in theaters Friday. But the East African nation will not be showing it, citing "prolonged and explicit sexual scenes depicting women as sexual slaves."
Under the ban, anyone who distributes or shows it in Kenya is liable to a fine, imprisonment or both.
"Fifty Shades" is based on a book by E. L. James. It tells the steamy story of young, attractive billionaire Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele, the young woman he sexually dominates. Jamie Dornan, star of the crime drama "The Fall," and Dakota Johnson play the lead characters.
The board that regulates movie content in Kenya warned theaters not to show the much-anticipated film.
"The Kenya Film Classification Board wishes to inform the public, film operators and stakeholders that the film has been restricted," it said in a statement this week. "It should not be screened or distributed to the public."
Last year, the board banned "The Wolf of Wall Street," saying it has "extreme nudity, sex, alcohol and drugs."
