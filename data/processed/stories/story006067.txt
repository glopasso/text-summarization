(PEOPLE.com) -- The bride has spoken!
Lisa Ann Russell and "Survivor" host Jeff Probst said, "I do," PEOPLE confirms exclusively.
The pair married Monday in front of family and friends in an intimate ceremony at a private Los Angeles residence, says a spokesperson for the couple.
This is the second marriage for both. Russell, 40, shares custody of two children with "Franklin & Bash" actor Mark-Paul Gosselaar, 38, who got engaged to advertising executive Catriona McGann this summer.
Probst, 50, will preside over the finale of "Survivor: South Pacific" on CBS December 18. His self-titled talk show will debut in the fall of 2012.
