(CNN)Is there such a thing as too much Chris Pratt?
After Deadline reported Tuesday that Disney is considering the "Guardians of the Galaxy" star for a possible reboot of the "Indiana Jones" franchise, hard-core Pratt fans and the not-so-much so took to social media to cast their votes.
Even "Modern Family" star Sarah Hyland and Matt Shively  of "True Jackson" weighed in to give their thumbs up.
"MythBusters" co-host Adam Savage offered an assist.
But not everyone was ready to jump on the ark with this casting decision.
For the record, this is not the first time this discussion has been had. Months ago, Latino Review reported that Bradley Cooper was being considered for the Indiana Jones role as part of a James Bond-ian recasting, in which different actors would helm the franchise over the years.
Variety writer Justin Kroll tweeted that Pratt didn't even know he was under consideration. Neither the actor nor Disney has commented on the speculation.
What do you think? Would Pratt be a good choice for the role, or nah?
