Music icon Stevie Wonder will headline a fundraiser in New Orleans early next month for longtime friend and supporter, Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu.
"We are overjoyed to have the continued support of the legendary Stevie Wonder, whose music resonates with Louisianians across the state," said Fabien Levy, Communications Director for the Landrieu campaign, in a press release out Tuesday. "His music has inspired millions, and we are excited to have him help us strongly close out our campaign."
The Times-Picayune reports that the event will take place Dec. 1, just five days before Landrieu faces a runoff against Republican challenger Rep. Bill Cassidy. The fundraiser marks the campaign's final push to get last minute support for the three-term incumbent.
This isn't the first time Wonder, who is set to receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom, has helped Landrieu this election season. He also recorded a radio ad for her during the primaries.
