Hoffenheim have continued their dream start to the German Bundesliga season, beating Schalke 2-0 to remain top of the table with three wins out of three.
The home side went into the half-time break with a one goal advantage, thanks to a header from Ghana defender Isaac Vorsah, who powered home a cross from captain Andreas Beck.
It was Vorsah's second successive goal following his winning strike against St Pauli two weeks ago.
And the points were sealed when German international goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was left helpless when Sejad Salihovic's free-kick struck the post, bounced off his chest, and flew into the net.
The result leaves Hoffenheim with a 100 per cent record, although four other sides are also in that position going into the weekend's Bundesliga fixtures.
However, big-spending Schalke, who gave a debut to Dutch international striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, are still without a point and struggling near the foot of the table, increasing the pressure on coach Felix Magath who nearly took the Blues to the Bundesliga title last season.
"I am satisfied with the game, we produced a good performance,"  Magath told AFP. "Unfortunately, we conceded two goals, that is unfortunate, but it can happen."
Kaiserslautern, Mainz, Hamburg and Hanover can all join Hoffenheim at the top of the table on Saturday if they win their respective matches.
Meanwhile, defending champions Bayern Munich take on Werder Bremen on Saturday.
