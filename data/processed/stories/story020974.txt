Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's forces fired mortars and guns at rebel forces in an apparent effort to break through a stalemated line west of the rebel-held city of Misrata on Sunday, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from the scene.
Rebels returned fire, and while some pulled back to seek cover from the incoming artillery shells, others moved forward toward the front line near the town of Dafniya, about 35 kilometers west of Misrata.
Libya has been in the throes of a civil war for months, since Gadhafi dug in his heels against popular efforts to force him out of power as anti-government protests sweep the Arab world this year.
