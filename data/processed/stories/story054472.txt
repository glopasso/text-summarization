In July, the world's newest vertigo-inducing observation deck opened in the mountains in Austria.
It joins an adrenaline-inducing roll call of clever platforms offering spectacular views.
1. Dachstein Stairway to Nothingness (Austria)
Visitors to Dachstein's Stairway to Nothingness must first cross Austria's highest bridge, which is 328 feet (100 meters) long and straddles a drop of 1,300 feet (396 meters).
They then face 14 steps that descend from the cliff face and which are surrounded by glass walls.
The entire structure took six months to build and was created by an engineering firm specializing in high-altitude construction.
The bridge that leads to the steps is the highest in Austria.
Dachstein Stairway to Nothingness, Dachstein Glacier, Austria; +43 0 3687/22042 800; admission free for children under 12, from $4 for adults

The upper one, which has floor-to-ceiling windows and 360-degree-views of the city, has a height of 1476 feet (450 meters).

3. Kinzua Skywalk (United States)
When the Kinzua Viaduct was built in Pennsylvania in 1882, it was the longest and highest viaduct in the world.
In 1900 it was rebuilt to carry heavier trains, using 3,175 tons of steel and 895,000 rivets.
In 2003, a tornado destroyed 11 of the 20 towers and it was decided that the remaining towers would be used to support the Skywalk.
The Skywalk extends 624 feet (190 meters) into the Kinzua Gorge and glass panels allow visitors to peer into the gorge below.
Kinzua Skywalk, 1721 Lindholm Drive, Mt. Jewett, Pennsylvania; +1 814 965 2646; admission: free

4. AlpspiX viewing platform (Germany)
At the base of Germany's Alpspitze mountain, the AlpspiX viewing platform comprises two steel beams, both of which measure 79 feet (24 meters) in length.
Visitors brave enough to walk to the end of the glass-walled platforms can look 3,281 feet (1,000 meters) down into the valley.
The platform remains open in winter, when the grid flooring allows snow and ice to pass through.

5. EdgeWalk CN Tower (Canada)
Located on the roof of the CN Tower's restaurant at a height of 1,168 feet (356 meters), the EdgeWalk allows visitors to slip into climbing harnesses and walk around the edge of Canada's tallest structure.
There's also a glass floor 1,122 feet (342 meters) above ground level, and although the glass is only 2.5 inches thick, it's reportedly strong enough to hold 14 hippos -- if they could fit in the elevator.
The EdgeWalk holds the world record for world's highest external walk attached to a building. CN Tower also has glass-floored observation deck and outdoor SkyTerrace.

Visitors who step into one of the boxes can see for 50 miles across four states.
Six million people have ventured into the boxes since 2009, 500 people have proposed in them and visitors can now even get married in them.
The boxes retract into the building when the windows need cleaning.

To attach the Cliffwalk, 16 anchor points were drilled 19 feet (six meters) into the rock face using 1,825 bolts, and 40 tons of steel were used.
The Cliffwalk also features two glass panels that have an anti-skid finish and were shipped over from Austria.
