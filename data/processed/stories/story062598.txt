A Pennsylvania woman was arrested and charged Wednesday with endangering the welfare of a child after showing police a photo of her 2-year-old child duct-taped to a chair.
Caira Ferguson, 21, revealed the photo as part of her claim that someone had stolen her identity, according to a Chester Township Police statement.
Ferguson has also been charged with unlawful restraint and false imprisonment, the statement said.
The photo was posted on mediatakeout.com, a news and gossip blog. It shows Ferguson smiling next to the child, whose hands are bound and mouth is duct-taped shut.
The child is dressed in a diaper and was photographed in July, police said.
"There were some issues with the identity, but our main concern was about the safety of the baby," said
Chester police Chief Kenneth J Coalson.
Police said they searched Ferguson's house Wednesday where they discovered a purple chair with remains of duct tape still attached to it.
It is not clear if Ferguson has acquired legal counsel.
