In the film, the teenage progeny of Disney's most famous meanies are sent to the kingdom's hottest prep school alongside other notable offspring, including the children of the Fairy Godmother, Mulan, and Rapunzel, where they face a dilemma of nature vs. nurture (or, evil vs. relatively normal).
"High School Musical" director Kenny Ortega is on board to helm and direct the film, which is slated to begin production in late May.
