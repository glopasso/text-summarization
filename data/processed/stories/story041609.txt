In April, Inside the Middle East discovers how some of the region's most creative artists are being inspired by current events taking place in the Middle East.
Egyptian artists inspired by the revolution
We visit Art Dubai to talk to Egyptian artists who interrupted their work when revolution came to Tahrir Square and repainted the country's political landscape.
Inspired by the events they witnessed in person, the artists have been given a new perspective on their world and their work.
Jordan's cartoon commentary
In Jordan we meet two brothers whose political cartoons have raised chuckles from Amman to Abu Dhabi.
Graffiti in Lebanon
Continuing the fraternal theme we travel to Beirut to encounter identical twins Omar and Mohammed Kabbani, who believe a spray can is more powerful than an AK-47 as they deliver social messages through graffiti, music and fashion.
Web creativity inspired by revolutions
Millions are watching the internet for parodies of political leaders including Mubarak, Gadhafi and Ben Ali. We embark on a web search for the funniest clips.
