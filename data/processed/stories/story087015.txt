Each year on Good Friday in Pampanga, Philippines, 75 kilometers (47 miles) north of Manila, devout Catholics reenact crucifixions to demonstrate their devotion to God.
It is the highlight of Holy Week and this year is scheduled to take place on Friday, April 22.
In 2010 Miguel Candela witnessed the colorful and intense event.
