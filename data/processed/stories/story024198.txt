With its over-saturated colors and vivid scenery, Disneyland doesn't really need the help of an Instagram filter.
Yet the House of Mouse's California theme park has been named the world's most Instagrammed location in 2014, clocking up more geo-tagged snapshots than any other.
Beyond the rides and slides of Disneyland, the photo sharing website's annual top 10 hot destinations includes fewer surprises that last year.
Bangkok's luxury shopping mall, Siam Paragon, the unusual winner of 2013's top spot, dropped to number four in 2014.
The continuous success of the mall (it ranked number two in 2012) has been attributed to the rise of photo sharing in Southeast Asia.
"Siam Paragon itself is more than just a shopping mall in Western terms. Aside from the many shops, cafes and restaurants -- taking a photo of your food/coffee is standard -- there's an aquarium, cinema and more," Jon Russell, Asia editor of global technology blog Thenextweb.com, told CNN last year.
