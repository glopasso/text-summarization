In focus -- 'Emiratization'
The UAE, like the rest of the Gulf, doesn't have a large indigenous labour force.
Expats make up majority of the workforce. So, the government began a process called "Emiratization."
In theory, its goal is to motivate locals to work, by creating jobs and training opportunities. But the UAE, like many of its neighbours, is a cash-rich nation. Citizens are entitled to a number of benefits, and few need to work.
So, how does the government create skilled local workforce? And why are women stepping up to drive the change?
