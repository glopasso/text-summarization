(EW) -- NBC and The CW weren't able to get their Wonder Woman projects off the ground, but CBS' "Two and a Half Men" is bringing the original warrior princess back to primetime.
The hit comedy has booked actress Lynda Carter to play "a version of herself" in the upcoming 11th season.
'Two and a Half Men' renewed, without Angus T. Jones as regular
The set-up: Alan (Jon Cryer) has a massive Carter crush going back to her days as an actress on the original "Wonder Woman" series (1975-79).
He gets to meet her in person and, well, you'll have to tune in to see what happens next.
"Men" is getting an overhaul this fall as Amber Tamblyn joins the show as Charlie's lesbian daughter, who moves in with Alan and Walden (Ashton Kutcher).
