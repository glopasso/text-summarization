Five crew members and a fishing vessel are missing off the coast of Nova Scotia, a Canadian official said Monday.
The Miss Ally sent out an emergency beacon about 76 miles (123 kilometers) southeast of Liverpool, Nova Scotia, Captain Doug Keirstead of Joint Task Force Atlantic said.
Coast Guard units from Canada and the United States are searching for the missing boat, which disappeared late Sunday in an area hit by 30-foot seas and wind that exceeded 74 mph (119 kph).
An empty life raft was found Monday morning, Keirstead said.
The Miss Ally was registered in Shelburne, Novia Scotia.
