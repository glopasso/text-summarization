Is it a thing or once again a show of a whole bunch of nothing?
Reports are circulating about "Seinfeld" costars Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander after they were spotted outside Tom's Restaurant in New York on Monday.
Better known to "Seinfeld" fans as Monks, it's a spot that the popular NBC series helped make famous after shots of its exterior were used in the show.
The Huffington Post reported that Twitter user Ali Philippides tweeted a pic of the pair entering the Upper West Side restaurant.
She told the publication that the celebs were filming inside, and the tip has sparked speculation about to what they are up to. Reunion? Super Bowl commercial? An episode of Seinfeld's Web series, "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"? Because we are almost positive there is coffee there.
According to Gothamist, "Seinfeld" co-creator and "Curb Your Enthusiasm" star Larry David was also seen exiting the eatery. As Jerry would say, "What. Is. Going. On?"
