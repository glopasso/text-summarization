A Texas man died after falling off the South Rim of the Grand Canyon.
John N. Anderson of Grapevine was visiting the national park with family on Saturday morning when he fell about 350 feet near the El Tovar Lodge, officials said.
Park rangers were unable to resuscitate him.
Anderson was with his wife on an outing but was alone when the accident occurred, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
"He wasn't trying to shoot a photograph or anything like that," his sister-in-law, Suzy Naughalty, told the newspaper on Tuesday. "It was just a freakish accident."
Anderson, 53, was married with two sons and a daughter.
The National Park Service and the Coconino County, Arizona, medical examiner were investigating the incident.
Nearly 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon each year. Rangers respond to some 1,300 medical incidents and 300 search and rescue missions annually, according to park statistics.
