Miguel Angel Jimenez may be the oldest golfer to win on the European Tour, but his lust for life has put a big dent in his hopes of extending that record in 2013.
The 48-year-old, known for his love of cigars and fine wine, has been ruled out for at least three months after breaking his leg while skiing in his native Spain at the weekend.
"When I took up skiing I knew the risks that I was taking, but I love it so much I could not stop," he told the European Tour website.
"I was going down a hill and lost control briefly and when I fell it was very sore. I knew immediately I had broken something.
"The medical staff at Sierra Nevada took me for an x-ray straight away and I am very thankful to them, as well as all of the staff at the hospital, for their quick and professional response. "
The verdict was a broken tibia, just below his right knee, and he had surgery after being taken to hospital in Malaga.
Jimenez became the European Tour's oldest winner when he triumphed in Hong Kong in November, his 19th victory on the circuit.
"I was playing very well at the end of the season so it is obviously not a good time for me to get injured," said Jimenez, a three-time member of winning European Ryder Cup teams and a vice-captain for Jose Maria Olazabal at Medinah this year.
"It has not all been bad news for me to finish the year, however, and in just a few days I will be opening my new golf school near Torremolinos."
