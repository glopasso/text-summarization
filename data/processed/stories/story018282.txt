A man brutally beaten in New York City was targeted because he is openly gay, the New York Police Department said Monday.
Two men shouting "anti-gay remarks" viciously beat Jack Price, 49, as he left a 24-hour deli on College Point Boulevard in Queens early Friday morning, police said. No further details where available about the attack.
Price is being treated at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, where "he is in fair condition and his vital signs are stable," said hospital spokeswoman Camela Morrissey.
Police arrested Daniel Aleman, 26, and charged him with assault and aggravated assault as a hate crime.
"When someone is attacked for being who they are, and for being proud of who they are, there is no other explanation for that attack than hatred and bigotry," said New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, the first openly gay speaker of the city council.
"I know the Queens community is outraged that hate has tainted their streets, and I know they will join with us in helping the local authorities find the second suspect."
The police department's Hate Crimes Task Force is investigating the incident.
No court date has been set for Aleman.
