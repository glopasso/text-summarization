Don't look for Adam Richman's new Travel Channel show "Man Finds Food" anytime soon.
As Richman deals with a social media backlash, the Travel Channel has put the series on hold.
Richman, also known for his other Travel Channel program, "Man v. Food," has been in a war of words on Instagram over a photo he posted that showed off his weight loss. The TV personality has lost more than 60 pounds since "Man v. Food" went off the air in 2012, and when he spoke about his new physique on Instagram using the hashtag #thinspiration, it sparked a heated online sparring.
Writer Amber Sarah recounted Richman's exchanges for the website XOJane, saying that some of his incendiary words were lobbed at a friend.
As Amber Sarah explains, the word "thinspiration" is commonly in pro-anorexia and pro-bulimia communities, and is usually found alongside "pictures of emaciated bodies, mantras like 'What's more important, that slice of pizza or a thigh gap?' and suggestions, tips, and motivation to either starve or purge."
According to reports, including Amber Sarah's, Richman responded negatively when he was told the meaning of the word, saying things like, "do I look like I give a f***?" and, "grab a razor and draw a bath. I doubt anyone will miss you."
Richman's personal Instagram account is locked, but he has apologized for his "inexcusable remarks."
"I've long since struggled with my body image and have worked very hard to achieve a healthy weight," Richman said in his apology. "Instead of responding to hurtful comments with compassion, I lashed out in anger.  I'm not asking for sympathy, but rather understanding and forgiveness. I can say with certainty that I'm taking a deep look at myself and I'm incredibly sorry to everyone I've hurt."
The Travel Channel hasn't commented on Richman's Instagram blow-up, or clarified why they're holding his "Man Finds Food" show. The network would only confirm that it's currently postponed indefinitely.
