Tim Smith, an American Airlines spokesman, denied reports that the Boeing 737 broke into pieces but did say that there was damage to the fuselage, some cracks and the landing gear on one side of the plane collapsed.
"The care of our passengers and crew members is our highest priority, and we will offer all the assistance necessary," said Gerard Arpey, the airline's chairman and chief executive officer.
Jamaican Information Minister Daryl Vaz said most of the 91 injured passengers had been released from hospitals. Four passengers may have to stay overnight at the hospital, Vaz said.
"The majority of injuries are broken bones and of course cuts and bruises and badly shaken up," Vaz said.
The flight originated from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in the Washington, D.C., area before landing in Miami and then heading to Jamaica, the airline said.
A Radio Jamaica reporter, Kirk Abraham, said it had been raining in the area when the plane failed to stop and ran into the fence past the end of the runway.
