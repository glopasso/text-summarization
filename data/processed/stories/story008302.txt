Ozzy Osbourne, the former front man of rock group Black Sabbath, says that after decades of living a life of drugs and sex, he's lucky to be alive today.
Speaking to CNN's Max Foster, Osbourne described in detail how he often played a dangerous game when it came to using drugs and having promiscuous sex.
"With the sexually transmitted disease, what I was doing is playing Russian roulette with sex," says Osbourne.
"With the drugs, it nearly killed me on a daily basis -- I did a lot of heavy drug taking for a long time and I survived it by the grace of God.
"You might not be as lucky as me -- I'm living on borrowed time."
In his autobiography, "I am Ozzy," Osbourne discusses his past, his family and his time with Black Sabbath.
Answering a viewer's question on whether he realized his power to change people's lives, Osbourne replied with shock.
"When you're on the inside looking, you don't see it that way," Osbourne said.
"But I suppose you're right. I do -- I do have the power to change people's lives."
What does he remember about Black Sabbath?
"We were just four kids from Aston in Birmingham who had a good idea and it worked out fine."
Osbourne also discussed the current state of the music industry and the "manufacturing" of artists today.
"It's completely different -- they're manufactured people now... like ice cream.
"Every now and then somebody comes out and I really like them -- I really like this Lady Gaga."
