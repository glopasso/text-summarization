Rafael Nadal has beaten Roger Federer 7-6 7-6 in the final of the World Tennis Championships exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi.
The world No.1 recovered from 3-0 down in the first set tie-break to eventually win 7-4 as Federer made a series of unforced errors to gift the Spaniard the opening set.
The second set proved equally close with both players unable to force a break of serve.
But Nadal made lighter work of the second set tie-break to overcome the World No.2 7-3.
The two men last met each other in November at the ATP World Tour Finals event in London where Federer was the victor in three sets.
What were the top tennis moments of 2010?
Nadal will be looking to regain the Australian Open title he won back in 2009 when the tournament starts on January 17 in Melbourne.
Should he succeed, he will hold all four grand slam titles at the same time, having won the French Open, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2010.
