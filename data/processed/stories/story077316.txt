One deal closed, now two more go: Fox announced today that Demi Lovato will return as a judge for the third season of "The X Factor."
Last season, Lovato served as a mentor in the young adults category alongside fellow judges Simon Cowell, L.A. Reid and Britney Spears. Naturally, Cowell will stick around but Reid and Spears both said they won't return.
"I couldn't be happier that Demi wants to come back this year," said Cowell in a statement. "She's a superstar in her own right and was a fantastic mentor last year. Even though she can be really, really annoying -- I truly enjoyed working with her and so did the artists. I'm especially pleased she's back even during her world tour!"

"I am so excited to return as a judge and mentor on 'The X Factor,'" added Lovato in a statement. "Last season was an unbelievable experience and I really enjoyed developing personal relationships with the contestants and the panel. I look forward to taking my previous experience and applying it to make this season even better!"
Lovato's new deal will help maintain some continuity on the show, which will undergo more change before returning this fall. No word yet on who will replace Reid or Spears, and it's unclear whether Khloe Kardashian will return as a co-host.
