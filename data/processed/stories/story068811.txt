Caroline Wozniacki made it 13 straight wins in her home tournament in Copenhagen on Friday the 13th as she dispatched French hope Alize Cornet 6-0 6-3.
The former world number one is bidding for her third straight title on the hard courts of the Farum Arena and has now won 19 straight sets without reply, dating back to the 2010 semifinals.
The Danish top seed will take on Petra Martic Saturday for a place in the final.
"I played well. I got a lot of first serves in and I didnÂ´t make any unforced errors, which always helps, of course," Wozniacki told the official WTA website.
Martic saw off Bojana Jovanovski 6-4 4-6 6-3 to make the semifinals in Copenhagen for the second year in a row.
Former top-ranked Jelena Jankovic continued her improved form, having gone into the event off the back of four straight defeats.
The Serbian third seed beat Kaia Kanepi 4-6 6-1 6-3 to reach her third semifinal of the year.
She will play second seed Angelique Kerber, who was taken to three sets before beating fellow German Mona Barthel.
Kerber trailed 5-2 and saved two match points before winning 6-2 0-6 7-5.
"It was a very tough match. Mona played unbelievable tennis, especially in the second, where I actually had no chance," said Kerber.
Meanwhile on the clay of Barcelona, Dominika Cibulkova is the highest seed left at number three after beating Yulia Beygelzimer of the Ukraine 3-6, 6-0, 6-0.
Second seed Julia Georges of Germany crashed out 6-2 6-3 to Sara Errani of Italy while Sorana Cirstea of Romania ended the fine run of Olga Govortsova of the Belarus 2-6 6-1 6-3.
