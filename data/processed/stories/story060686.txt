Ford on fashion
For many, Tom Ford's vision of accessible luxury at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent in the 90s epitomised the glamour of that decade. His latest label Tom Ford Menswear is infused with the kind of elegance he is known for and aims to revolutionise the notion of luxury he created. In Milan, he talks about why he won't be offering a catwalk collection and shares his plans for the future in New York.
