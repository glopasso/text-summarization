The American woman who sent her adopted son back to Russia must pay $150,000 in child support, a Tennessee judge reaffirmed Friday.
Torry Hansen's attorney, Ed Yarbrough, told CNN he will file a motion within a few weeks asking the court to modify or terminate the support, which was first ordered earlier this year.
The United States and Russia last year signed an agreement to strengthen procedural safeguards for adoptions following the 2010 incident.
Grandmother: Adopted boy sent back to Russia was violent
Artyem Saveliev, adopted from a Russian orphanage, was put on a plane back to Moscow. The Shelbyville, Tennessee, family claimed they feared for their safety after a series of violent episodes from the boy, then 7.
An investigation was launched after the child showed up unannounced at Russia's child protection ministry with a letter from his adoptive mother asking Russian authorities to annul the adoption.
In the letter, Hansen said the boy was "mentally unstable," and said she had been misled about his mental condition.
The World Association for Children and Parents had coordinated the adoption. A lawsuit was filed against Hansen for breach of contract and child support.
In May, the association said Artyem is still a U.S. citizen and under Tennessee law Hansen is legally considered to be his mother.
The child has been living in a group care facility outside of Moscow.
According to CNN Nashville affiliate WKRN, Hansen testified Friday in Lewisburg, Tennessee, that the boy wanted to kill her.
But Larry Crain, the adoption agency's attorney, said the boy is not violent.
