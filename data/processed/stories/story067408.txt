Authorities in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, have arrested a man whom they accused of having terrorized students, their parents and the administration of a grade school for three months.
Alberto Enrique Hernandez Magallanes, 62, is accused of making phone and written threats asking for money.
"There have been threats against several schools, but this is the first time we have been able to make an arrest," said Arturo Sandoval, Chihuahua State Ministerial Police spokesman, after police acted Tuesday.
Alberto Enrique Hernandez Magallanes, 62, is accused of making phone and written threats asking for money in exchange for not hurting the children. Police said he sent school administrators notes in packages that included bullets.
Citing security concerns, police asked that the name of the school not be divulged. The spokeswoman for Chihuahua's state prosecutor, Daniela Gonzalez, described it as a private school with a student body drawn primarily from middle- to upper-class families.
"School administrators were anxious and afraid," Gonzalez said. "The letters were escalating in demands until they reached the $50,000 figure. They feared for their safety and the safety of the children."
Gonzalez said police helped her negotiate with Hernandez, who agreed to accept $10,000 and a sport utility vehicle.
After he collected the money, Hernandez ran to his home, half a block from the school, where he was arrested, Gonzalez said.
Police said they confiscated rifles, guns and ammunition.
Sandoval said investigators don't think Hernandez is linked to Mexico's drug cartels that have laid siege to Ciudad Juarez, which is across the border from El Paso, Texas.
"He is a person that, because of the current insecurity climate in the city, has taken advantage of the situation," the police spokesman said.
