2. The ship weighs in at more than 114,000 gross tonnage and measures 951 feet in length. Its maximum speed was designed to be 23 knots.
3. Among the amenities on board: a wellness center, five restaurants, 13 bars, four swimming pools and a giant movie screen. The ship has 1,500 cabins.
4. Its name -- Concordia -- is Italian for concord, or harmony.
5. About 4,200 people were on board the ship when it ran aground. Most of the passengers were Italian, as well as some French and German citizens.

An estimated 126 Americans were also on board, according to the U.S. State Department.
