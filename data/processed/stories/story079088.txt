A Connecticut group home employee has been put on administrative leave without pay after a video that appears to show her abusing a woman resident with an intellectual disorder was sent to the operators of the group home, the state and CNN affiliate WFSB.
The video appears to show the caretaker at the group home kicking the woman in the gut, whipping her with a belt and kicking and dragging her across the floor by her hair.
The DVD was titled "The Perfect Employee" and labeled as having been shot at an East Hartford group home. It was sent anonymously and came with no other details.
Options Unlimited Inc., the privately held nonprofit that operates the home under contract with Connecticut's State Department of Developmental Services, said in a statement: "We are deeply saddened and appalled by this incident. As soon as we became aware of it, we took prompt action and placed the employee on unpaid administrative leave."
Terrence W. Macy, commissioner of Connecticut's Department of Developmental Services, said he was outraged by the video.
"Why would one human being do this to any other human being?" he asked. "This is a person who requires a lot of support, bathing and assistance eating," he told WFSB.
WFSB's reporting went on to say that state officials have examined the other residents in the East Hartford group home but "found no bruises or other signs of recent abuse."
Macy confirmed that the employee depicted is no longer working at the group home.
"This person was immediately put off duty with no pay and pending an investigation, which now will be conducted by the East Hartford Police," he said.
The East Hartford Police Department would not comment on the ongoing investigation.
In its statement, Options Unlimited said it was cooperating with the Department of Developmental Services and the East Hartford Police Department.
