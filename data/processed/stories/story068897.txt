CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR:  Celebrating 20 years of commercial-free news for the classroom, this is CNN Student News! This show is awesome. I'm Carl Azuz. You know how we look now; over my shoulder, you can see our sweet graphics from the 1980s. A look back is coming up after our top stories. Let's go!
First Up: Terror Indictment
AZUZ: First up, a new charge against Najibullah Zazi, one of the suspects arrested in connection with a terrorism investigation. He's been indicted on a charge of conspiracy "to use weapons of mass destruction." Zazi was arrested last weekend. This is all part of a Justice Department investigation into an alleged plot to set off explosives in the U.S. In a hearing yesterday, another suspect, Ahmad Afzali, who was arrested on charges of lying to authorities, was released on bail of $1.5 million. But his travel is being restricted.
Security Council
AZUZ:  Meanwhile, the United Nations Security Council is looking to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. All 15 countries who are members of the group voted for a resolution that would tighten control on nuclear materials. The measure also supports the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The presidency of the Security Council rotates between the member nations. This month, the U.S. has it, which is why President Obama ran yesterday's meeting.
Pittsburgh Summit
AZUZ:  After the U.N. summit, he and other world leaders headed to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for a gathering of the G-20, a group of the world's leading economic powers. They're not the only ones in town, though. Protesters have flocked to the city to take part in demonstrations. Yesterday, an unauthorized march turned violent as protesters clashed with police officers. As for the G-20, the global economy has improved since the last time it got together. But as Ed Henry reports, there's still a lot of work to do.
ED HENRY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: When these 20 leaders last met, it was spring in London and the global recession was still catching fire. But as President Obama wrapped up his first big moment on the international stage, he declared they were putting out the flames.
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We finished a very productive summit that will be, I believe, a turning point in our pursuit of global economic recovery.
HENRY: Five months later, there are signs the recession is coming to a close. But unemployment is still sky-high, helping to fuel protesters already waiting for the leaders in Pittsburgh.
(SOUND OF PROTESTERS)
HENRY: The president acknowledged to CNN's John King that unemployment may get worse in the next few months, which is why he will be pushing his counterparts to sign on to a specific pledge to make the global economy more balanced.
OBAMA: We can't go back to the era where the Chinese or the Germans or other countries just are selling everything to us, we're taking out a bunch of credit card debt or home equity loans, but we're not selling anything to them.
HENRY: But getting the Chinese to sign on will be difficult, especially after Mr. Obama slapped a tariff on Chinese tires, which raised questions about whether leaders are reneging on free trade promises they made in London.
STEVEN SCHRAGE, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC & INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: So, is the United States going to be standing up and stopping this slippage? Or is it going to be further pushing the world down towards trade conflicts and possibly a downward spiral of new types of protectionism?
HENRY: Another potential dispute: European leaders continue to push hard for a crackdown on bonuses paid to bankers. And while Mr. Obama last week reiterated his call for broader reform of Wall Street, his hand has been weakened by inaction in Washington.
SCHRAGE: The U.S. is really handicapped by the fact that its own reforms haven't gotten out of Congress. So, while they can talk about these broad reforms, until the United States is really active, it's hard for them to set the course.
Disaster Declaration
AZUZ: Catching up on a couple other headlines now, starting with the recovery process in Georgia following this week's deadly flooding. President Obama has issued a Federal Disaster Declaration for four counties in the state. That will free up money and aid to help with the relief efforts. Requests for federal aid in other counties are being reviewed.
Kennedy Replacement
AZUZ: And the governor of Massachusetts has picked Paul Kirk, who you see here, to fill the U.S. Senate seat left empty by the death of Sen. Ted Kennedy. He's only taking over the seat temporarily, however. A special election for a permanent replacement is set for January. Kirk has said he doesn't intend to take part in that process.
