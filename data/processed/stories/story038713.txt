Rory McIlroy has been handed a fitness boost ahead of the prestigious WGC-Accenture World Match Play Championship in Arizona next week.
The Northern Irishman was forced to see a back specialist following last weekend's Dubai Desert Classic, after suffering some discomfort during the tournament -- in which he finished sixth.
However, McIlroy, who is playing on the US PGA Tour this season, has been told his problem is nothing more than a slight nerve impingement -- and some rest should see him fit to play in the Tucson event.
McIlroy's spokesman, Martin Hardy, told Press Association Sport: "He just needs to rest for a day.
McIlory has been told his problem could be linked to the hip movement in his swing and the 20-year-old added: "The physios go backwards and then forwards and that puts a little strain on the lower back.
"I do all the exercises I can to make everything stronger around the joints and it is a matter of resting and managing my schedule so that I am not playing too many weeks in a row."
