(CNN)Gunshots were fired at rapper Lil Wayne's tour bus early Sunday in Atlanta.
No one was injured in the shooting, and no arrests have been made, Atlanta Police spokeswoman Elizabeth Espy said. Police are still looking for suspects.
Officers were called to a parking lot in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, Espy said. They arrived at 3:25 a.m. and located two tour buses that had been shot multiple times.
The drivers of the buses said the incident occurred on Interstate 285 near Interstate 75, Espy said.
Witnesses provided a limited description of the two vehicles suspected to be involved: a "Corvette style vehicle" and an SUV.
