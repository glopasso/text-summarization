But how did a drug that was originally tested for the treatment of heart problems end up in bedrooms across America? Take a look back at Viagra's history.
1989:  British Pfizer scientists Peter Dunn and Albert Wood create a drug called sildenafil citrate that they believe will be useful in treating high blood pressure and angina, a chest pain associated with coronary heart disease. The drug is classified as UK-92480.
1991: Dr. Nicholas Terrett is named in the British patent for sildenafil citrate, or Viagra, as a heart medication. Terrett is often considered the father of Viagra, according to ViagraBox.com.
Early 1990s: Pfizer completes several early trials of sildenafil citrate that provide little hope for its use as a heart disease treatment. But volunteers in the clinical trials are reporting increased erections several days after taking a dose of the drug, according to researcher Ian Osterloh.
"Around the same time, other studies were revealing more information about the biochemical pathway involved in the erection process," he writes for Cosmos magazine. "This helped us understand how the drug might amplify the effects of sexual stimulation in opening up the blood vessels in the penis. With UK-92480â€²s chances of treating angina now slim, we decided to run pilot studies in patients with erectile dysfunction."

The Washington Post reports that the CIA is using Viagra to gain friends in Afghanistan. "While the CIA has a long history of buying information with cash, the growing Taliban insurgency has prompted the use of novel incentives and creative bargaining to gain support in some of the country's roughest neighborhoods, according to officials directly involved in such operations."
July 25, 1999: Popular TV show "Sex and the City" airs "The Man, The Myth, The Viagra," in which character Samantha dates a wealthy older man who uses the little blue pills. In the next season, Samantha takes the little blue pill herself to enhance her sexual experiences.
