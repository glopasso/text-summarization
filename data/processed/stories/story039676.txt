Flames danced hundreds of feet in the east Texas sky hours after a fire broke out at a natural gas and chemical facility.
There were no injuries reported at the fire in Mont Belvieu, about 35 miles east of Houston, said Rick Rainey, a spokesman for Enterprise Products.
A worker who was unaccounted for was believed to be away from the site, but the company was conducting a search, Rainey said.
The fire broke out shortly after noon at a facility used to store natural gas liquids. The cause was not known.
A two-mile perimeter was cleared around the plant.
A nearby school restricted outdoor activities.
"The plant is within five miles of the school and according to the emergency command center, there is no indication that the fire is of a toxic nature, since they believe the fuel driving the flame is natural gas," said Barbers Hill Superintendent Greg Poole. "Additionally, the wind is blowing away from us."
"We don't believe this is a safety issue," Poole said. "However, we do have a lot of parents here at the school who are employees over at Enterprise, so that's caused a lot of concern for us here."
According to its website, Enterprise Products owns or has interest in approximately 19,200 miles of onshore natural gas pipelines that provide for the gathering and transmission of natural gas in Alabama, Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming.
