Grappling with drought conditions, California officials on Tuesday approved statewide emergency water restrictions.
The restrictions are the first of their kind statewide, California Water Board spokesman George Kostyrko said, and will affect lawn watering, car washing, hosing down driveways and ornamental fountains.
Infractions could bring a fine of $500 per day.
Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency for California in January. State officials say last year was one of California's driest years ever.
