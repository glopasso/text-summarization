AC Milan coach Leonardo does not want unsettled midfielder Gennaro Gattuso to leave the club during the winter transfer market.
The veteran has failed to earn a regular spot in Leonardo's side because of injuries and the coach's squad rotation policy.
Gattuso, a near-certain selection for Italy's World Cup squad, said last week he could leave Milan before the end of his contract in June 2011 if his playing time did not increase.
"If Gattuso has this idea in his head, I will try to make him change his mind," Leonardo told reporters.
"I know Rino (Gattuso) well. I played with him. I always speak to Gattuso and try to be very clear. Now the most important thing is that he recovers from the muscular injury."
Gattuso has been a reported target for Manchester City but AC Milan club administrator Adriano Galliani added: "The other day I showed him (Gattuso) the midfield of the top five teams in Europe and he would not have been a starter in any of those.
"Why leave, only to be relegated to the bench somewhere else?"
The 31-year-old has been with the Rossoneri since 1999 and was a crucial member of the Italy squad which won the 2006 World Cup. He has made seven league appearances for Milan this campaign.
