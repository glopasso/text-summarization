A grenade exploded Saturday during a routine vehicle inspection near a base in Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul, a spokesman for the U.S.-led International Security Assistance Force said.
The explosion occurred at about 7 p.m. local time near Camp Eggers, Maj. Bryan Woods said.
The were no reports of casualties. But the blast forced the temporary lockdown of the fortified base, which sits a short distance from the presidential palace.
"The base is secured at this time and has resumed operations," Woods said.
In eastern Afghanistan, a suicide bomb attack killed at least one ISAF service member, according to officials.
ISAF did not release the service member's nationality or details about the attack.
