(Rolling Stone) -- Sinead O'Connor has gotten back together with husband Barry Herridge, only days after announcing plans to end their marriage of less than a month.
O'Connor said they had split last week due to a conflict with Herridge's family.
"Spent a beautiful evening of love making with none other than my husband," the Irish rocker wrote on her website. "We decided to be boyfriend and girlfriend again and stay married, but we did rush [into marriage]." O'Connor predicts they will be "sickeningly happy" together and says she plans to meet with a marriage counselor. She also hopes to move in with her husband "in like a year, like regular people."
O'Connor married Herridge, her fourth husband, after a whirlwind romance. They wed on her 45th birthday at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Earlier this year, the singer went about a public search for a new man on her website, wrote a series of suicidal tweets that alarmed her fans and revealed plans to release a new album next year.
