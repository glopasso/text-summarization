An Estonian man was sentenced to seven years in prison on Thursday for his role in stealing more than 240,000 credit card numbers.
Aleksandr Suvorov, 28, had previously entered guilty pleas in two separate schemes. One involved hacking into a computer system belonging to the Dave & Buster's restaurant chain to steal the credit card numbers of 81,000 customers.
The second illegal operation involved a conspiracy to sell more than 160,000 stolen credit card numbers to a buyer in San Diego. The buyer turned out to be an undercover agent with the U.S. Secret Service.
"Computer hackers like Mr. Suvorov victimize businesses and individuals, posing a serious threat to their financial security," said Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice's Criminal Division.
"Suvorov reached across an ocean to victimize thousands of Americans," said Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. Her office prosecuted the Dave & Buster's case. "He will now serve his sentence in the country of his victims."
Suvorov did not work alone in either of the plots. In the one involving Dave & Buster's he was an accomplice of Albert Gonzalez, a man the Justice Department describes as "one of the most prolific identity thieves ever prosecuted by the U.S. government." Gonzalez received a 20-year sentence in March 2010 for his role in several hacking operations including the one involving Dave & Buster's restaurants.
