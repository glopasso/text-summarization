(CNN)"It's showtime!"
Michael Keaton paid homage -- ever so slightly -- to his roles in "Beetlejuice" and "Batman" in his third turn hosting "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982.
"I had a baby -- he's 31. I also have a new girlfriend -- she's 28," he said.
Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to "play" Batman and Beetlejuice with them.
All they got in response were a couple of one-liners.
Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its "deadpan" manner and "unpredictable weirdness," in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from "Walking Dead" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update.
Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy "She's All That."
Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate.
The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin.
Baldwin said on Twitter that she's taking it as a "crazy compliment" and shared a clip from the skit.
