The old adage is: Advertising is good for business.
Here's another newer adage. Bragging about an illegal marijuana operation and posting it on YouTube for the whole world to see is, well, maybe not the best idea.
The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police busted Jason Pelletier and his wife, Stephanie, on Friday after being tipped off to YouTube videos under the name Buddynuggets78, chronicling weekly updates of their pot crop.
"In my opinion, the most arrogant of all of them I've seen," Lt. Laz Chavez with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police told CNN affiliate KLAS.

In his videos, Buddynuggets78 goes into great detail describing his operation, the light setup and the number of plants.
"Just doing another weekly update to show the progress at this point," says a YouTube post.
Chavez called Jason Pelletier "a hardened criminal with a very serious criminal history" that includes guns and drugs.
