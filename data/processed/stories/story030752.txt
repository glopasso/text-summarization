YUZHNO-SAKHALINSK, Russia (Reuters) -- A brown bear killed a tourist camping on an island off Russia's Far East coast on Thursday and was then shot by fellow campers, local police said.
Bears have come into increasing conflict with humans in remote regions of Russia as their natural habitat has faced growing encroachment from both development and tourism.
The man sustained "fatal injuries as a result of the attack" on the Bolshoi Shantar island off the Pacific Ocean island of Sakhalin, said a police spokeswoman.
Local radio station Vostok Rossii said fellow campers were woken by loud growls and saw the bear kill the 36-year-old man. Other campers later shot the bear. A police team will fly to the island to investigate the incident.
Two tourists were injured in similar bear attacks on the Bolshoi Shantar island this year. Both survived.  E-mail to a friend
