"Fifty Shades of Grey's" infamous "Red Room" has arrived.
The first trailer for the romance drama, which is adapted from E L James' best-selling erotic novel, gives fans a racy hint of what's to come. With a new version of Beyonce's "Crazy In Love" as its soundtrack, the 2Â½-minute clip closes out with a glimpse into the infamous scarlet boudoir of James' imagination.
Explaining 'Fifty Shades' wild success
Starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, "Fifty Shades" tells the story of naive, mousy Anastasia Steele (Johnson), who falls for a handsome billionaire with "singular tastes" named Christian Grey (Dornan).
With so many fans intimately familiar with James' work, the movie has been under intense scrutiny during every step of production, from the choice of screenwriter and director to the leading cast.
When Johnson was announced as the lead actress last year with "Sons of Anarchy's" Charlie Hunnam as Christian Grey, it caused an uproar among fans who were rooting for different actors to land the roles.

Hunnam soon dropped out because of scheduling conflicts, opening the door for Dornan to land the part.
Written by Kelly Marcel and directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson, "Fifty Shades of Grey" arrives in theaters February 13.
