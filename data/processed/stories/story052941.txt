(EW.com) -- Every single episode of "The Simpsons" is going online, fully searchable.
FXX is launching "Simpsons World," a new way of getting on demand "Simpsons" content, in October. For the first time, viewers can access every episode of the series via their computer or other networked devices. "Authenticated" FX viewers will have instant access on iPhone, iPad, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Android phones and tablets, Smart TVs, and additional set-tops devices.

Viewers will also be able to search for specific quotes, curate their own own personalized playlists, and share their favorite show clips and quotes. (Hulu currently carries a library of classic "Simpsons" clips, though only the series' eight most recent episodes are available for viewing on that streaming service.)
"I don't want to over-promise, but this website can provide you with affordable health care," joked longtime "Simpsons" executive producer Al Jean.

The site is part of FXX's cable acquisition of the exclusive cable rights to repeat episodes of Fox's landmark animated hit.
Also, as previously announced, "The Simpsons" is getting the Longest. Marathon. Ever: FXX will air 25 seasons of "The Simpsons" in a row.
That's 522 episodes, and "The Simpsons Movie."
According to FXX, this will make it the longest-running marathon in television historyâ€”all "Simpsons," all the time, 24 hours a day, for 12 days, in chronological order. The marathon begins August 21, so order those cases of Duff now.
