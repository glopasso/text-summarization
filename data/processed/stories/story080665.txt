The sole survivor of a shooting last month at a Cracker Barrel Old Country Store and Restaurant near Cleveland died Tuesday, her family said.
Kayla Allen was wounded April 12 when her father opened fire on the family, killing Kayla's mother and sister.
She took a turn for the worse last week, according to a post on a Facebook page set up to help share news about her health and raise funds.
"Kayla, in a perfect body, with no pain or sadness, is in heaven with her mother, sister and our Lord Jesus Christ. Her suffering is over. She is in an eternal paradise," read another post on that page Tuesday.
Her family confirmed the news through a written statement.
"Kayla has died peacefully at home. She has been surrounded by family and friends for the past few days, comfortable and serene. This time has been most meaningful to us as we held her and loved her, prayed for her and said our goodbyes," it read.
The shooting took place after police received a 911 call from a woman at the restaurant in Brooklyn, Ohio, that "she had just informed her husband that she was leaving him and he wasn't taking it well," Police Chief Scott Mielke said then.
The woman told police her husband was in a car circling the eatery.
When officers arrived, they heard gunshots and encountered a man leaving the restaurant with a gun. When the gunman failed to surrender to authorities, they fatally shot him.
In addition to the gunman, a woman and a girl were dead at the scene. Kayla was wounded and transported to a local hospital for treatment.
