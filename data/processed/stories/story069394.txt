Borussia Dortmund stretched their lead at the top of the German Bundesliga to 12 points but had to settle for a 0-0 draw with Schalke.
The league leaders dominated against their opponents, Lucas Barrios and Mario Götze going close, but couldn't find the breakthrough.
The stalemate saw them extend their lead by a point, though second-placed Bayer Leverkusen can reduce the gap to nine if they win at Nurnberg on Saturday.
Dortmund should have taken the lead inside the first ten minutes as Götze and Jakub Blaszczykowski tested Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.
Lucas Barrios then rifled a shot narrowly wide of the post as the home side continued to press before Mats Hummels poked an effort wide from a free kick.
Schalke had a half chance just before the break but former AC Milan striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar headed over the bar from Jefferson Farfan's cross.
Barrios then diverted Blaszczykowski's cross onto the post with Neuer beaten as Dortmund piled on the pressure in the second half.
Efforts from Lukasz Piszczek, Lukas Schmitz and Sven Bender were repelled by an inspired Neuer.
Schalke had a rare chance to take the lead when former Real Madrid striker Raul put Jose Jurado through on goal, but his shot was half blocked by Roman Weidenfeller before Marcel Schmelzer cleared the ball off the line.
Then Götze squandered the game's best chance as he collected Piszczek's pass and rounded Neuer but could only hit the post with a shot on the turn.
Schalke moved up to ninth with their hard-earned point.
