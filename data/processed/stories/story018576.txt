Bobbi Kristina Brown, daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown, is engaged.
The groom-to-be is Nick Gordon, who was taken under Houston's wing at age 12 and raised alongside Bobbi. The two grew especially close after Houston's death in 2012 and are soon to be married. Bobbi took to Facebook to respond to the haters who think their relationship is a little ... Cullen-esque. ("They live together, it's weird.")

Her post was very clear — she's in love, and she's not listening to the opinions of others. She said her mother approved of and encouraged their relationship, and she is very happy with Gordon. See the full post below:
"YES, we me nick are engaged. I'm tired of hearing people say "eww your engaged to your brother or if Whitney was still alive would we be together or would she approve of this." Let me clear up something, we aren't even real brother and sister nor is he my adoptive brother. My mom never adopted him. In fact, mommy was the one who even said that she knew that we were going to start dating. My mom knows me better than any of you. A lot of yall are saying that yall are only saying this all out of love. Which is bull because if that was so, all you would want is for me to be happy. People need to seriously stop judging my relationship. Pretty sure it's my own decision who I want to be with. Yes, my relationship may not be perfect. We will have rough patches, just like every other relationship. And we have had our rough patches. You may or may not agree with my relationship. You may or may not respect it. Judge me, go ahead. Your opinions are yours and mine are mine. It is my life and not yours. The decisions I make have nothing to do with you. Goodnight"
