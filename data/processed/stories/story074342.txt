It's a sentiment many of us have shared: "Marriage isn't for me."
But when writer Seth Adam Smith shared concerns over his impending marriage with his father, his advice proved to have mass appeal.
"You don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy," Smith wrote in a blog post recounting his father's words.
"More than that, your marriage isn't for yourself, you're marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn't for you. It's not about you. Marriage is about the person you married."
By Thursday, four days after Marriage Isn't For You published, the post had received 24 million views, Smith said in a follow-up post on his blog. It led to a great deal of media coverage and TV appearances on the Today Show, Fox & Friends and more.
"Honestly, I thought that 5,000-10,000 clicks would have been a monumental accomplishment. So to see a number like 24 million is staggering, inspiring, overwhelming, and more than a little intimidating," Smith wrote in the post.
Whether it's a fear of commitment, the complexities of cohabitation or just a love of one's own, blissfully uninterrupted company, there are an awful lot of deterrents to a stroll down the aisle. But every now and then, people like Smith drop some words of wisdom that resonate widely, putting it all in perspective.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, grandparents and divorcees tend to be full of advice. Check out some of our favorite relationship advice on the Web.
