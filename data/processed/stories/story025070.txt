(CNN)Ricardo Medina, the former "Power Ranger" arrested Sunday in the fatal stabbing of his roommate, has been released from custody while law enforcement investigates Joshua Sutter's death.
No charges have been filed against Medina, who police said stabbed Sutter in the abdomen with a sword, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said this weekend.
The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has asked law enforcement to continue to investigate, spokesman Ricardo Santiago said.
The two got into an argument in their Palmdale, California, home, Saturday that turned into a physical altercation, the department said. Police said Medina told them he stabbed Sutter after Sutter forced his way into Medina's bedroom.
Medina called 911 after the altercation and was interviewed by detectives. He was arrested and held on $1 million bail until Tuesday, according to online court records.
Local media reported Sutter's death Saturday, and TMZ was the first to identify Medina as the actor who played the Red Ranger in 2002's "Power Rangers Wild Force." He also appeared in "Power Rangers Samurai."
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed to CNN that Medina was an actor who portrayed a Power Ranger.
