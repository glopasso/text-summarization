The bassist of the rock band 3 Doors Down faces a driving under the influence charge after his arrest Tuesday in Mississippi.
Police found Todd Harrell "slumped over the steering wheel" of a vehicle stopped at an intersection in D'Iberville, Mississippi, a police statement released Wednesday said.
Harrell, 42, "showed signs of impairment and was arrested and charged with 2nd offense DUI," police said.
The musician was charged with vehicular homicide in Nashville, Tennessee, last April after his speeding car allegedly clipped a pickup truck, sending it down an embankment and killing the driver, according to a Davidson County, Tennessee, sheriff's spokesman.
Harrell showed signs of impairment and acknowledged he had consumed hard cider and taken the prescription pills Lortab and Xanax after that incident, police said. The case is still pending.
His group may be best known for its song "Kryptonite," but it had a string of hits in the early 2000s, including "When I'm Gone" and "Here Without You."
Harrell is one of three founding members of the group that formed in Escatawpa, Mississippi, in 1994, according to allmusic.com. The band toured regionally before eventually being discovered at a music showcase in New York.
The band's major label debut, "The Better Life," has sold more than 6 million copies, according to the Recording Industry Association of America.
