A fierce storm tore Friday evening through the town of Bel Air in northeast Maryland, damaging buildings, peeling off roofs, flipping a pickup truck, and felling trees and light poles, officials said.
At least four people were injured, said Dave Williams, a spokesman for the Harford County Volunteer Fire & EMS Association, in an e-mail to CNN affiliate WMAR.
One of the injured was in a car dealership in the Fallston area, which partially collapsed, said Robert Thomas, a public information officer for Harford County. A second structure, a single-family home, was struck by a tree, he said.
Two of the injured were taken to hospitals, he said.
Central Harford County bore the brunt of it: two buildings -- a mobile office trailer and a one-story auto detailing and repair facility in the Fallston area -- were destroyed; more than a dozen homes were damaged, he said.
Search-and-rescue operations were being conducted Friday night in the affected area, which was concentrated within a mile radius of Fallston, which had lost power, he said.
A number of people were freed after becoming trapped, the Baltimore City Fire Department reported on its Twitter page. Bel Air is about 20 miles northeast of downtown Baltimore.
Radar detected a funnel cloud in the area at 6:41 p.m., 11 miles northeast of the town, CNN's weather department said.
