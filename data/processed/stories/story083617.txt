Robert Downey Jr.'s son Indio is in trouble with the law.
Indio Falconer Downey, 20, was arrested Sunday on drug possession charges. He's since been released on bail.
"Indio Downey was a passenger in a vehicle stopped around 2 p.m. Sunday," according to West Hollywood Sheriff's Station Sgt. Dave Valentine. "Downey was found to be in possession of what officers believed to be cocaine as well as a smoking pipe. Downey was arrested for possession of a controlled substance and drug paraphernalia, and posted bail around 9 p.m. that same evening."
Robert Downey Jr.'s representative released a statement saying that Downey was "grateful to the Sheriff's department for their intervention."
"Unfortunately there's a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it," the rep said.
"Also, there is a lot of family support and understanding, and we're all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he's capable of being. We're grateful to the Sheriff's department for their intervention, and believe Indio can be another recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale."
The elder Downey had several well-publicized issues with drug addiction in the 1990s. He went through treatment a number of times, including a year in the California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison, before finally getting clean in 2001.
Indio Downey is the son of Downey and his first wife, Deborah Falconer. Downey and Falconer divorced in 2004 after almost 12 years of marriage.
