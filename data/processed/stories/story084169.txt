What do heroin and Obamacare have in common?
Nothing -- save for more than 1,200 packets of heroin that had the words "Obama Care" and "Kurt Cobain" printed in red on the packaging that Massachusetts State Police say they uncovered in a drug bust.
State police said the labels are nothing more than marketing ploys.
"It's a branding by the particular drug dealer so when the drug gets out to the population, you know what it is," said Police Lt. Daniel Richard. "It's just a branding so you can say if this brand is good or bad. It's like putting Pepsi or Coca-Cola on a bottle."
Trooper Joseph Petty stopped a vehicle with four people in the Town of Hatfield on Friday morning after noticing the vehicle was committing several traffic violations.
Tyler Robenstein and Ashley Beaulieu of Vermont and Marquese Jones and Sherod Green of New Jersey were taken into custody and face conspiracy to violate drug laws and possession charges.
The driver, Robenstein, was charged with speeding, unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle and failure to change lanes for an emergency vehicle, police said.
The Hampshire County Jail in Northampton said late Saturday afternoon that Robenstein and Beaulieu had been released on bond. Jones and Green were still being held.
