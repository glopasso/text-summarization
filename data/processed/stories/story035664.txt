The first few items are standard classroom material, but not the last -- which is why a 15-year-old boy at Toronto's Jarvis Collegiate Institute ended up under arrest, according to police.

He is set to appear in court at Toronto's Old City Hall on Saturday morning, police said.
According to its website, Jarvis Collegiate Institute is the oldest secondary school in Toronto, having been founded in 1807.
