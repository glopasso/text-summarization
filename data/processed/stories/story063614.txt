The suspected leader of Mexico's New Juarez Cartel has been arrested, the state-run Notimex news agency reported Sunday, the latest in a series of high-profile drug arrests.
Alberto Carrillo Fuentes, aka "Ugly Betty," was captured in the western state of Nayarit, Notimex said. The report did not describe the circumstances of his arrest, nor did it say when it happened.
Last month, Mexican authorities arrested Mario Armando Ramirez Trevino, a suspected leader of the country's Gulf Cartel.

They nabbed Zetas leader Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords, in July -- marking the most significant blow to drug trafficking in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December.
Notimex reported that Carrillo Fuentes is the brother of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, who died in 1997 as a result of undergoing plastic surgery to alter his appearance in an effort to avoid capture.
The late Carrillo Fuentes was known as the "Lord of the Skies" because of the large fleet of jetliners he used to transport cocaine from Colombia to Mexico.
