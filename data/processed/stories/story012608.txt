(EW.com) -- When "Fast and Furious 7" opens in theaters in 2015, audiences can expect to see Paul Walker.
The actor died in a car accident on November 30 before he finished filming the next installment of the popular action franchise. The tragedy not only was a devastating shock to the production, a creative team that prides itself on its sense of family, but it put in doubt whether the new film could be completed at all.

Universal quickly shut down production â€” which was approximately halfway done â€” and postponed its summer 2014 release date while it reconsidered its options.
Would Walker's character be removed from the film and the script rewritten? Could his scenes be saved by filming additional footage with a double or CG effects? That remains unclear, but over the weekend, Vin Diesel took to his Facebook page to inform fans that "Fast and Furious 7" will now open April 10, 2015.
Universal followed with an official statement that confirmed that Walker still would be part of the picture.
