Two whistleblowers will divide nearly a half million dollars following the  latest settlement between the Justice Department and independent contracting firms  working in Iraq.
DynCorp agreed to  pay the U.S. government $7.7 million, and its subcontractor The Sandi Group promised to pay a bit more than $1 million dollars for overcharges they  presented to officials, the Justice Department said Friday in a press release.
Drew Halldorson and Brian Evancho, both former Sandi Group employees who alerted authorities about the overcharges, will divide $481,710 as their share of the government's recovery in the case, according to the federal department.
DynCorp was sued for inflated claims involving construction  of camps from containers shipped to locations where contractors were able to set  up temporary accommodations for fighting forces.
The Sandi Group was sued for  improperly seeking reimbursement for "danger pay," which it falsely claimed to have paid  its employees in Iraq, the Justice Department claimed.
"The hard work of  stabilizing Iraq is challenging enough without  contractors and subcontractors inflating the cost of rebuilding by making false  claims at taxpayer expense," said Assistant Attorney General Tony West.
Spcial Inspector  General for Iraq Reconstruction Stuart Bowen, Jr. said in the release that his office continues to  pursue a number of other allegations involving false  claims.
