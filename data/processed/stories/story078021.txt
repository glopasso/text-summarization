Mexican authorities say they've detained the father-in-law of one of the country's most wanted drug lords.
Police Tuesday morning detained Ines Coronel Barreras, 45, on drug-related charges, officials told reporters.
He is the father-in-law of Sinaloa cartel leader Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, authorities said.
In January, the U.S. Department of the Treasury described Coronel as a "key Sinaloa cartel operative."
Weapons and packets of marijuana were seized in Tuesday's operation, but no shots were fired, said Eduardo Sanchez Hernandez of Mexico's interior ministry.
Authorities said Coronel is the father of Guzman's third wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, whom he married in 2007.
Guzman's nickname, which means "shorty," matches his 5-foot-6-inch frame, though he has climbed to great heights in the drug business.
The Sinaloa cartel is one of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking operations, and Forbes has estimated Guzman's net worth at $1 billion.
U.S. authorities arrested a woman believed to be Guzman's daughter in October. She was deported in December after she pleaded guilty in federal court to possession of a false visa.
Coronel's arrest is one of the most significant blows to organized crime in Mexico since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December.
The high-profile arrest comes two days before U.S. President Barack Obama is scheduled to arrive in Mexico.
