A senior Pakistani Taliban leader was killed in a NATO airstrike in Afghanistan's volatile northern Kunar province, the NATO-led coalition said Saturday.
Maulawi Dadullah was one of several insurgents killed Friday in an airstrike in Kunar's Shigal wa Sheltan district, according to a statement released by the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force.
Dadullah, also known as Jamal, was responsible for moving fighters and weapons through the area, ISAF said. Dadullah also coordinated attacks against Afghan and coalition forces, fighters and weapons, according to ISAF.
Dadullah's deputy, identified only as Shakir, was also killed in the airstrike, the coalition said.
Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said by telephone from an undisclosed location that Dadullah was one of a dozen fighters killed in the airstrike.
No civilians were injured and no property was damaged in the airstrike, ISAF said.
The coalition did not say how it identified Dadullah nor did it release details about how the airstrike occurred.
