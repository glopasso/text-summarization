Richard Bach, author of the 1970s classic "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," was seriously injured in a small plane crash on San Juan Island, Washington, a dispatcher said Saturday.
Bach was flying the plane, which went down Friday afternoon. No one else was aboard.
He was trying to land on a small, private airstrip when the undercarriage of the plane clipped power lines, said Michael McElrath, a dispatcher with the San Juan County Sheriff's Office.
The National Transportation Board is helping to investigate the crash, which started a small brush fire on the island. San Juan Island is between the U.S. mainland and Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
McElrath did not know details of Bach's injuries. The author was flown to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he was listed in serious condition.
Bach, who lives on nearby Orcas Island, flies frequently, the dispatcher said.
Best known for "Jonathan Livingston Seagull," Bach wrote several other books, including "Illusions: The Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah" and "A Gift of Wings."
"Jonathan Livingston Seagull" tells the story of a restless seagull that loves to fly. It includes photographs by Russell Munson, and was made into a movie in 1973 -- three years after it was first published.
