Another go at "Iron Man"? Robert Downey Jr. would welcome the opportunity.
Hollywood's highest-paid actor told Entertainment Weekly that he would have no problem putting on the big red suit if Marvel will have him back.
Robert Downey Jr.: Hollywood's highest-paid actor (again)
"It's down to Kevin (Feige, Marvel Studios president) and Ike (Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment) and Disney to come to us with what the proposal is, and that's on us to agree or disagree," Downey said. But he added, "Right now, this has just been swell, hasn't it?"
Downey is currently filming the new "Avengers" movie.
The first three "Iron Man" films have been among the highest-grossing of the last decade. The first, "Iron Man" (2008), made more than $300 million in the United States and close to $600 million overall. The second, "Iron Man 2" (2010), did about the same here but improved on its overseas performance.
And the third film, "Iron Man 3" (2013), made more than $400 million domestically and -- including international grosses -- topped out at more than $1.2 billion.
Downey was careful to add a "you never know" to his apparent enthusiasm.
"It's that thing of: Why give up the belt when it feels like you can barely get jabbed?" he said. "Most people are saying that right when they get knocked out."
