The wife of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said she is closing down her popular French blog.
Anne Sinclair, who has been writing about life in the United States on her blog, "Two or Three Things Seen in America" since 2008, wrote Monday: "You understand the circumstances which force me to temporarily suspend this blog."
She closed by saying, "See you soon."
Strauss-Kahn, who is awaiting a trial on sexual assault charges, was released on bail from the Rikers Island jail Friday.
He is accused of trying to rape a maid this month in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York. He will stay with his wife.
Strauss-Kahn faces two counts of criminal sexual act; two counts of sexual abuse; and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, Strauss-Kahn is accused of having "engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion," an indictment states.
There appears to be growing popular sympathy for Sinclair, a former television broadcaster described by some as the "Barbara Walters" of France.
"She is very courageous," said Jack Lang, one of the elders of France's Socialist Party, as well as a friend and neighbor of Strauss-Kahn.
In her message to her blog readers, Sinclair said, "You have sent me very many messages. I cannot answer each one but know that they touched and helped me."
