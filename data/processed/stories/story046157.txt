When Britney Spears sings "you better work, b***h," it sounds like she might be singing that to herself.
The 32-year-old pop star has had a hectic year -- a new album, "Britney Jean," preparations for her upcoming two-year Las Vegas residency and her everyday role as a mom to two boys.
Spears admitted while promoting E!'s documentary "I Am Britney Jean" that there are times she thinks about not just slowing down but retiring altogether.
"I have thought about it," Spears told E!. "If I happen to have another baby or something like that, I'd probably move back to Louisiana. I do miss Louisiana. I miss the people. I miss the food. I miss the way of life, how everything is really simple."
But retirement remains just an idea rather than a plan. "I think right now is my time to perform and do what I'm doing," she said.
"Britney Jean" has been promoted as her most personal disc yet, and the E! documentary went behind-the-scenes of Spears' life as the singer prepared for Vegas.
Along the way, the pop star offered up revelations on everything from her thoughts on sex (she loves it) to her favorite bubble gum flavor (watermelon) to why she thinks she's not really made for this industry.
"Personally, I'm really a shy person," she said. "I'm particularly not really made for this industry because I am so shy. It's not something that I deal with so well."
Besides the difficulty of being in the public eye, she also insists on perfection when performing -- or as Spears put it in the doc, "Being a perfectionist really sucks."
"It's just a lot of pressure," she explained, but that pressure is also what keeps her going. "I have that motivation in rehearsals to make it the best every time. That's why I do what I do."
