Of course, every list like this is bound to be contentious -- no room for Thomas MÃ¼ller, for example? You chose Howard over Neuer? It would have been easy to choose a tranche of German players for this list, but there have been some wonderful performances, both team and individual,from a wide variety of sources over the course of the tournament.
Some players had exceptional tournaments, others had moments, or games, of sheer brilliance. Most wore their hearts on their sleeve throughout. All were hugely entertaining.

This XI, plus a few substitutes and one larger-than-life manager, are the players we think merited special mention.
Here's to a remarkable World Cup.
