(CNN)Police in Long Beach, California, are asking for the public's help to find a 3-week-old who was abducted after the child's mother, father and uncle were shot Saturday.
Two victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, according to the police, and a third has been treated and released.
Authorities told CNN that the attacker possibly knew the family and that immediately after the shooting, a man fled the home with the child.
The baby's name is Eliza Delacruz.
The suspect has dark skin, law enforcement said, but provided no other details. Investigators don't have any information about a vehicle the attacker might have used, they said.
Anyone with information should call the police communications center at (562) 435-6711. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous may call 1-800-222-TIPS (8477), or text TIPLA plus your tip to 274637 (CRIMES), or visit www.LACrimeStoppers.org.
