(EW.com) -- How's your year going? Probably not as well as the Rock's.
The former wrestling star (and host of TNT's "The Hero," which premieres Thursday night) is in the midst of an amazing box-office streak. He's starred in four movies so far in 2013 — Snitch (Feb. 22), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (March 28), Pain and Gain (April 26), and Fast & Furious 6 (May 24) — and while they haven't all been massive hits, three of them opened at No. 1. All together they've grossed over $937 million worldwide, giving the Rock (a.k.a. Dwayne Johnson) some major box-office bragging rights.
"As you know, I've been around for some time now," the Rock told EW recently. "This is my 12th and 13th year in the business. Building an empire was the goal." And built an empire he has!
In fact, for the past 15 weekends — yes, since Feb. 22 — the Rock has had at least one movie in the Top 10 at the U.S. box office. And considering audiences' enduring love of the Fast franchise, he's got a few more weekends left before that streak ends, too. Here's how it's all worked out:
Feb. 22-24 -- Snitch (No. 2)
Mar. 1-3 -- Snitch (No. 4)
Mar. 8-10 -- Snitch (No. 5)
Mar. 15-17 -- Snitch (No. 6)
Mar. 22-24 -- Snitch (No. 10)
Mar. 29-31 -- G.I. Joe: Retaliation (No. 1)
Apr. 5-7 -- G.I. Joe: Retaliation (No. 2)
Apr. 12-14 -- G.I. Joe: Retaliation (No. 4)
Apr. 19-21 -- G.I. Joe: Retaliation (No. 5)
Apr. 26-28 -- Pain & Gain (No. 1), G.I. Joe: Retaliation (No. 6)
May 3-5 -- Pain & Gain (No. 2)
May 10-12 -- Pain & Gain (No. 3)
May 17-19 -- Pain & Gain (No. 4)
May 24-26 -- Fast & Furious 6 (No. 1)
June 1-3 -- Fast & Furious 6 (No. 1)
Pretty incredible, right? If that's somehow not enough to convince you that the Rock is winning pop culture right now, then take a look at his Twitter stream. It's pretty much the best thing on the internet, and that should count for something!
