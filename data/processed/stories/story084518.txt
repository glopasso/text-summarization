The director of athletic training at an Ohio university died Tuesday night when a bus carrying the wrestling team and others crashed, the school said Wednesday.
Dan Gorman, 52, director of athletic training and associate professor of human performance and sport business at the University of Mount Union, died from injuries suffered in the crash about 11 p.m., according to a statement from the university. Mount Union is in Alliance, Ohio, about 32 miles southeast of Akron.
The bus was carrying the school's wrestling team, coaches, statisticians, an athletic trainer and athletic training students, the statement said. It was returning to campus after a match at Ohio Northern University in Ada, about 16 miles east of Lima, when it was involved in the crash near Bucyrus, Ohio.
The Ohio State Patrol said it is investigating the crash, which occurred between the university bus and an Ohio Department of Transportation snow plow. Both vehicles were eastbound, the patrol said in a statement, and the vehicles collided when the bus attempted to pass the plow, which was plowing the left lane.
Twenty-eight passengers were on the bus, the state patrol said. Gorman was pronounced dead at a hospital, and four others were treated for minor injuries and released.
Gorman came to Mount Union in 1985, the school said, and was "integral to the success of the university's athletic training program." Mount Union said it was making counselors and the university chaplain available to members of the campus community.
