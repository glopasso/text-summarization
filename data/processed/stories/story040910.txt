William Ward Warren was 15 when his dad dropped him off at Dallas Love Field to see President John F. Kennedy arrive in the city, on the same day JFK was assassinated.
Students in Dallas, Texas, had November 22, 1963, off from school in recognition of the visit. Warren decided to take along his 8mm camera.
The result was "the best home movie known to exist of the Kennedy arrival," according to Gary Mack, curator of the The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza.
The color film offers new glimpses of the president and Mrs. Kennedy, wearing a pink Chanel suit, coming down the steps from Air Force One and greeting well-wishers.
The Kennedys can then be seen from the side as they walk past the camera smiling. Vice President Lyndon Johnson is seen close up as he greets people standing on the tarmac.
"I was very excited," says Warren, now 61. "It had rained the night before and cleared off that next day, which was an interesting event, and it was a very positive day. It was cool and yet the sun was shining bright, and there was lots of excitement."
Warren donated the 8mm color home movie to the museum, Mack said in a news release.
According to the news release, the only color images of President Kennedy in Dallas were made by amateurs, except for a brief film by a White House photographer.
The museum is on the sixth and seventh floors of what was known in 1963 as the Texas School Book Depository. The Warren Commission determined that Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy from that location.
