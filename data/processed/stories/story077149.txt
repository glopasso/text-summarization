This week in iReport we're celebrating a couple anniversaries. It's been 20 years since the world watched the Berlin Wall fall. And, that children's television favorite "Sesame Street" turned the big 4-0. Meanwhile, Hurricane Ida stormed ashore, slamming the Gulf Coast. We've got all this and more in this week's video wrap-up.
Berlin Wall anniversary -- Twenty years ago this week, the Berlin Wall came tumbling down in a decisive moment in a revolution that ultimately ended decades of Communist rule and signaled the end of the Cold War. For many iReporters, the fall of the wall holds personal significance. They dug into their photo albums to share memories of this historic event.
Bracing for Ida -- iReporters updated on preparations and conditions as Hurricane Ida approached the Gulf Coast. Two iReporters shared several photos of preparations in Pensacola Beach, Florida, including closed roads, sandbags and high tides, saying it "packed a pretty good punch." Another in New Orleans compared the rising waters from Ida with those of Gustav last year.
Can you tell me how to get to Sesame Street? -- The classic children's television show 'Sesame Street' turned 40 this week. CNN producers collaborated with iReporters to create a fun video alphabet that would make Jim Henson proud. iReporters of all ages also shared their memories of "Sesame Street" and how the show made an impact on their lives.
