A high-pressure system over the Northwest United States is giving new meaning to the term Baked Alaska.
But relief is coming, according to meteorologists.
The National Weather Service reported that several record-high temperatures were recorded across the south-central part of the state this week.
Tuesday saw record highs for that date -- 81 in Anchorage, the state's largest city, and 70 in Seward, situated on the Gulf of Alaska about 75 miles south of Anchorage. The city of Homer saw a record-tying 74 degrees Tuesday.
The normal temperature for Anchorage this time of year is about 63 degrees.
North of Anchorage, Talkeetna and Palmer each saw record-tying temperatures for the date -- of 89 and 78, respectively.
Monday was even toastier, with Talkeetna recording a temperature of 96 degrees, shattering the record of 91 that had stood since 1969. Monday's temperature in Seward was 88, also a record.
Cordova and Valdez, both along the southern coast, saw a record-breaking 90 degrees Monday.
"An expansive ridge of high pressure over Southern Alaska is continuing the string of unusually hot days," the weather service said in a public advisory Monday.
The NWS further forecast that temperatures would begin cooling Tuesday, and "the cooling trend will continue on Wednesday."
The highest-ever temperature in the state came almost a century ago, when Fort Yukon recorded 100 degrees on June 27, 1915.
