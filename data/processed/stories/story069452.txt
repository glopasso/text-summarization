Samsung's new flagship Android smartphone, the Galaxy S3, today becomes available in 28 countries, including several European markets such as Germany and the UK.
The Galaxy S3 is the cream of the crop of Android smartphones, with a 4.8-inch touchscreen, a 8-megapixel rear-facing and 1.9-megapixel forward-facing camera, and the latest version of Android â€” Ice Cream Sandwich.
It also sports some neat innovations, such as a sensor that tracks eye movement, preventing the screen from going dark when you're looking at the device.
