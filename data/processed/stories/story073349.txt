Walt Disney Studios is chipping a new "Frozen" film off the old block.
On Wednesday, the studio announced that its blockbuster 2013 movie will soon have a miniature sequel in the animated short "Frozen Fever."
The film will reunite the award-winning creative team behind "Frozen," including "Let It Go" songwriters Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, and will bring the film's central characters back to life.
Inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen tale "The Snow Queen," "Frozen" told the story of two sisters, Anna (voiced by Kristen Bell) and Elsa (Idina Menzel), and how an impressive but isolating gift of Elsa's almost came between them.
When "Frozen" was released in November, critics praised it as a return to Disney's prime, and the box office backed that up. Domestically, "Frozen" earned about $400 million and was the third highest-grossing film of 2013.
Disney's new short, "Frozen Fever," will focus on Anna's birthday as her sister, Elsa, and rugged love interest Kristoff "are determined to give her the best celebration ever." But, Disney's statement warns, "Elsa's icy powers may put more than just the party at risk."
Don't worry, hug-loving snowman Olaf (Josh Gad) is returning for "Frozen Fever" too, and there'll be a new song. "Frozen Fever" is expected to bow in the spring.
