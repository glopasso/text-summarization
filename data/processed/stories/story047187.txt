Six people face charges including theft and trespassing in the aftermath of a wild party over the Labor Day weekend at a former NFL player's second home while he was out of town, police in New York state said Thursday.
Brian Holloway, a former offensive tackle for the New England Patriots, was in Tampa, Florida, during the holiday weekend when his son told him he was receiving tweets about a party at their home in Stephentown, New York, Holloway said.
"I thought it was a joke," he told CNN.
According to a news release, the six suspects, who range in age from 17 to 21, turned themselves at the Rensselaer County Sheriff's office.
A 19-year-old was arrested for "organizing, advertising, and providing alcohol for the party," the police statement said. He faces two felony charges, including third-degree burglary, and two misdemeanors.
Three of those arrested are accused of stealing a granite eagle statue and are facing felony grand larceny charges.
Two others among the six arrested are accused of trespassing and providing alcohol to children.
The party made national news after the homeowner, a former offensive tackle for the New England Patriots, reposted pictures and tweets from the party online.
Brian Holloway said the 300 teens at the party did more than $20,000 damage to his home.
He said some of the kids had been to other parties at his house.
The investigation continues and more arrests are expected, police said.
