(CNN)Three years ago this week, singer Whitney Houston was found dead In a bathtub at a Los Angeles-area hotel.
Now, her only child, Bobbi Kristina Brown, is in a medically induced coma after she was found unresponsive in her suburban Atlanta townhouse -- also in a bathtub.
Houston's death was ruled an accidental drowning. But many questions remain about what happened to Brown.
The family isn't saying much. Neither are police, though they've said they're treating Brown's case as a criminal investigation.
Though little concrete information has surfaced, rampant rumors certainly have. The speculation prompted Brown's family to admonish some media outlets, saying "the desire to be 'first' has clouded the judgment of many reporters."
