(EW.com) -- Welcome back to another round of EW.com's "American Idol" Power List -- in which I attempt to predict how America will vote for the finalists and you all disagree with me and post your own ranking, and it's okay because none of us plebes are fortune-tellers and the only being who knows exactly what will happen is celestial mouthpiece Ryan Seacrest.
Wait 'til you see where I put hair model DeAndre Brackensick (pictured) as the Top 13 head into tonight's two-hour Whitney Houston/Stevie Wonder performance round. You're gonna freak out! Read through my photo gallery ranking of The Top 13, then leave your own list in the comments....
