It appears the force may be back with Harrison Ford.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, filming has resumed for "Star Wars: Episode VII" in the wake of Ford's on-set injury. In June Ford, 71, broke his leg while filming the eagerly anticipated movie. A spokesperson said at the time that the injury was caused by an accident and Ford later underwent surgery.
"His surgery was successful and he will begin rehab shortly," the spokesperson said at the time. "He's doing well and looks forward to returning to work."
Ford is reprising his famous role as Han Solo and was filming at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, England. The production was reportedly on hiatus while the actor recovered. Details about the film have been closely guarded.
"Star Wars: Episode VII" is still set to be released on December 18, 2015.
