Top seed Li Na defeated former Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova 7-5, 6-1 in the final of the Aegon Classic in Birmingham, England.
Li of China, who beat Sharapova in the semifinals of the same tournament last year before losing to Magdalena Rybarikova in the final, outplayed the Russian to claim her first title of the season and her first ever on grass.
Second-seed Sharapova, who had won in Birmingham in 2004 and 2005, surged into a 3-1 lead before Li broke back for 3-3.
The Chinese player took the set 7-5 and ran away with the second as Sharapova's game unraveled.
The Russian threw down seven double faults and only won 56% of points on her first serve, while Li fired winners off both flanks and closed out victory in one hour, 19 minutes.
