(CNN Student News) -- November 13, 2014
As a lame duck session gets started in the U.S. Congress, we're defining what that means, telling you what's ahead for lawmakers, and reporting on how a controversy surrounding immigration may factor in. We're also looking at the issue of diplomacy today: What role did it play in a presidential trip to China? How might spending time abroad help students learn lessons in diplomacy? It's all included on this Thursday's show!
