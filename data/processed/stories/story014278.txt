Rafael Nadal beat Novak Djokovic in a one-sided Monte Carlo Masters final Sunday to claim his eighth straight title in the principality.
Nadal brushed aside the world number one 6-3 6-1 in just 78 minutes to end a run of seven straight defeats in finals to the Serbian, including this year's six-hour epic at the Australian Open.
"I've always felt unbelievable here," a visibly emotional Nadal said after his emphatic victory.
"It's unbelievable to win this historic tournament eight times. I always feel great when I come here.
"I had lost to Novak seven times, so losing eight would not have been much different. But to win this one makes a big difference."
Nadal has made the title his own at the distinctive clay court tournament overlooking the Mediterranean and was clinching his 20th in a Masters 1000 tournament, the first man to reach that landmark.
But he had not won on the ATP Tour since claiming the French Open at Roland Garros last June as Djokovic has dominated.
Djokovic, who was playing this week after learning of the death of his grandfather in Serbia, took the first game to love but struggled to maintain that level.
"I'm sorry for my performance today, Rafa played well and deserved to win today," said Djokovic.
"I'm still very happy to reach the finals for the second time," he added, referring to his 2009 loss to Nadal in Monte Carlo.
Nadal will now go to defend his Barcelona title next week as he builds up to the second grand slam of the season in Paris on his favorite clay surface.
In other tennis action Sunday, Fed Cup holders the Czech Republic beat Italy 4-1 in Ostrava to seal their place in the final.
Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova gave the Czechs an unbeatable 3-0 lead after seeing off Francesca Schiavone 6-4 7-6 in the first rubber of the day.
The Czechs will host Serbia, who beat Russia 3-2 in Moscow, in the final.
