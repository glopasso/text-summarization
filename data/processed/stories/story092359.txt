Actress Ashley Judd and champion race car driver Dario Franchitti are ending their marriage after more than 11 years.
A representative for the actress confirmed the news Tuesday.
Best known for movies such as "Double Jeopardy" and "High Crimes," the actress attended Franchitti's races for years. She cheered from the sidelines, wearing floppy hats and cheery sun dresses.
Shortly after the news broke, Judd  tweeted that the pair will remain "family forever" despite the divorce.
"Family forever," Franchitti tweeted her back. His tweet was later deleted, but still appeared in a log on his website.
The star has said she did not know much about cars, but that changed when she met Franchitti.
Hours before the divorce was announced, Judd responded to a Twitter question about her favorite sports car. She said her taste in cars mirrors  that of Franchitti.
"Especially the old Porsches and Ferraris," she tweeted. "He has taught me about the art or the automobile."
The pair got married in his native Scotland in 2001.
In addition to her movie roles, Judd served as a Tennessee delegate at the Democratic National Convention last year.  Her attendance sparked speculation that she may be considering a Senate run in her home state of Kentucky.
She also advocates for humanitarian causes, and has traveled to nations such as Cambodia and Rwanda as part of her mission.
Franchitti is a three-time Indianapolis 500 winner.
