(EW.com) -- Twentieth Century Fox is moving ahead with another Wolverine standalone movie.
"The Wolverine" director James Mangold is in talks with the studio to write a treatment and longtime X-Men producer Lauren Shuler Donner will collaborate again, as Deadline reported. The storyline is being kept under wraps for now, and Hugh Jackman is waiting to see a script before he commits to another go as the shredded mutant.
Jackman's Wolverine will play a major role in next May's "X-Men: Days of Future Past," bridging the original X-Men franchise with the younger First Class crew. But that movie also completes his contract to play Wolverine, a role he's been associated with for more than a decade. He's not currently obligated to another Wolverine movie and would likely negotiate a healthy raise for a new adventure.
"The Wolverine" was a modest blockbuster in the U.S. this summer, but it earned more than twice as much abroad and grossed more than $413 million altogether.
