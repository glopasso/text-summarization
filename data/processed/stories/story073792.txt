A New Jersey man is under arrest after a routine traffic stop led to a search of his apartment and the discovery of bomb-making materials and weapons, Roselle Park police said.
Travis Dulk, 27, was arrested early Wednesday morning and charged with unlawful possession of a weapon, unlawful possession of hollow-point ammunition and possession of cocaine and narcotics, according to police Chief Paul Morrison.
Authorities seized weapons -- including an M4 assault rifle -- as well as hundreds of rounds of ammunition and canisters of black powder in a search of his apartment.
"There was no bomb that would be readily available. There were materials that could be consistent of making a device," Morrison said of the items discovered.
"There were at least 10-12 fully loaded magazines on a table, in plain view," the chief added.
Dulk was stopped on a traffic violation around 4 p.m. Tuesday near the New Jersey Garden State Parkway, a statement from the police department said. Police became suspicious after noticing 9 mm bullets on the floor of the driver's side of the vehicle, the chief said.
When he was searched, Dulk was found to being carrying a handgun loaded with hollow-point bullets, as well as several bags of cocaine and prescription drugs, the police statement said.
Dulk initially consented to having his apartment searched but later changed his mind, Morrison said. Police got a search warrant and, with a bomb squad, conducted a midnight raid of the apartment. The apartment complex was also evacuated.
Police are investigating whether the weapons recovered were legally purchased.
Dulk is being held at the county jail on $115,000 bail as the investigation continues. It was not immediately clear whether he had legal representation.
