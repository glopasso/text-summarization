Zsa Zsa Gabor asked her husband to call a priest to her hospital bedside "to read her the last rites" Sunday, according to her publicist.
Gabor, 93, is "in very serious condition" at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, according to her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt.
"It's a sad time for them right now," spokesman John Blanchette said Sunday.
The actress has been hospitalized for most of the past month since breaking her hip in a fall from bed on July 17.
Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband.
She was rushed to the hospital from her Bel Air, California, home Friday night, Blanchette said.
She underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot that night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, he said.
Gabor had just returned home from the hospital on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace a hip broken in a fall from her bed.
Gabor has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt.  The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.
Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge," "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953, "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
