Famed attorney Robert Shapiro -- best known to the public as part of O.J. Simpson's legal "dream team" -- is now defending actress Lindsay Lohan, according to Lohan's father.
Lohan's former lawyer, Shawn Chapman Holley, resigned last week shortly after releasing a statement about her client's "harsh and unfair" sentence. Lohan was ordered Tuesday to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. She was also sentenced to spend 90 days in a drug and alcohol rehab program after her jail term is completed.
The actress must begin serving her sentence on July 20.
Michael Lohan sent an e-mail to CNN Thursday stating that Shapiro had been hired, and expressing hope that his daughter's sentence would be reevaluated if she is allowed to attend rehab first.
"Bob (Shapiro) is representing her," Lohan wrote. "But tell me, why is (it) that I had to cry from the mountain for Lindsay to listen to me, and now finally she is doing what I said? None of this would have happened if Lindsay and (her mother) Dina had. I was telling Dina and Lindsay this for years now. I just pray that they implement everything else I said, like getting clean off all meds, asking the court to go to rehab first and then reevaluate Lindsay's incarceration."
Michael Lohan, who is divorced and reportedly has a rocky relationship with his daughter, also wrote that he hopes Lindsay picks "all new friends and management, and finally that Dina (attends) counseling with Lindsay and me. I thank Mr. Shapiro and think he will agree with my suggestions, since unfortunately, he has been down this road as well. It doesn't matter who takes the credit, Dina or Bob. As long as Lindsay gets off the meds and listens to me, that's all I care about."
Shapiro's son died of a drug overdose in 2005.
