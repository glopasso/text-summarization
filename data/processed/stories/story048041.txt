Germany made it seven wins out of seven with a comfortable victory over Azerbaijan to put themselves on the brink of qualification for Euro 2012.
Goals from Mesut Ozil, Mario Gomez and Andre Schurrle helped Joachim Loew's side to a 3-1 triumph in Baku as they moved 11 points clear in qualifying Group A.
It would take an unlikely series of events for them to be caught by second placed Turkey, who have a game in hand on their rivals.
Real Madrid midfielder Ozil was first to find the net, collecting Benedikt Hoewedes' cross before firing a drive into the corner.
Ozil was the architect for Germany's second, as he slid a pass through for Gomez to double the lead.
Azerbaijan managed to pull a goal back in the final minute of the match through Murad Huseynov but Schurrle put the game beyond doubt in injury time.
In Group E, Milan striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic scored a hat-trick for Sweden as they thumped Finland 5-0.
Ibrahimovic came on as a substitute in the first half and registered his hat-trick within 22 minutes. Kim Kallstrom and Emir Bajrami added the other goals.
The win takes Sweden three points behind Netherlands, who lead the group.
