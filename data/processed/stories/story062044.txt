(CNN)Way to put your thing down, flip it and reverse it, Missy Elliott!
According to Mashable, the singer/rapper/producer has returned to the charts after her performance during Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday. Elliott joined main performer Katy Perry on stage at halftime and performed a medley of some of her hits, much to the delight of fans.
Those same folks apparently rushed to iTunes to download Elliott's music. Eight of her songs cracked the iTunes top 200 chart, including 2002's "Work It," 2001's "Get Ur Freak On" and 2005's "Lose Control."
Those songs also electrified Spotify. Streams of Elliott's music increased a whopping 676%, the music service reported.
Elliott also won the Internet if the tweet love is any indication; even fellow celebrities had fan moments.
Elliott released her last album in 2005 and three years later went public with her battle with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the thyroid. On Monday,  she took to Twitter to express her gratitude for the outpouring of affection.
But not everyone remembered the glory days of the trash bag outfit being "Supa Dupa Fly." Some viewers hailed the "new artist," a move reminiscent of recent tweets celebrating Paul McCartney as "one to watch" after he released a song with rapper Kanye West.
Elliott doesn't mind people just now discovering her.
Looks like it won't be a problem for long: Billboard reports the artist is on track to have a 1,000% gain in sales for the week ending February 1.
