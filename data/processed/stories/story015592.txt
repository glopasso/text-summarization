The shooting deaths of five people at a suburban Atlanta spa Tuesday night was a murder-suicide triggered by a domestic dispute, police said Wednesday.
A man shot himself to death after killing his two sisters and their husbands at the Su Jung Health Spa in Norcross, Georgia, according to a police statement.
The man had been asked to leave the business earlier in the day, but returned at 8:40 p.m. and began shooting with a semiautomatic pistol, police said.
The names of the dead, all in their early 50s to mid-60s, have not been made public.
"The Norcross Police Department continues to investigate the incident and has worked with the (South) Korean consulate in this incident," the statement said.
