Britain's Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, visited a camp for Syrian refugees in Jordan on Wednesday.
The camp, run by the United Nations, UNICEF and Save the Children, is home to about 1,000 people who have fled the two-year Syrian civil war.
Jordan has been receiving about 7,000 new refugees a day, according to UNICEF.
While at the camp, children sang to the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall.
The cost of war: 2 million Syrian children afflicted by trauma, disease, malnutrition
Their visit comes on the same day Save the Children issued a report saying that more than 2 million children have been afflicted by trauma, malnutrition or disease during the Syrian civil war.
The war has interfered with vaccination efforts across the country, the group said. About two-thirds of Syrian children lack vaccinations for preventable diseases, according to the group's report.
In addition, one in three children have been injured in the warfare, the report said.
Meanwhile, in Syria, the European Union said Wednesday that an employee of its delegation in Syria died in a rocket attack in Derava, a Damascus suburb.
Ahmad Shihadeh died while providing humanitarian assistance to residents of the city, where he also lived, the EU said.
