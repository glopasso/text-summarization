New York City's annual Halloween parade may go dark for a second year if organizers don't raise $50,000 by Monday to make up for losses caused by Superstorm Sandy in 2012.
For the first time in its 39-year history, the parade was canceled at the last minute in 2012 after Sandy "Frankenstormed" the event.
In order to host the hundreds of puppets, more than 50 bands, dancers, artists and thousands of costumed New Yorkers, organizers say they must raise the sum by Monday.
The organizers started a campaign to raise the money through online fundraising site Kickstarter.com that will end Monday. As of Thursday the online campaign had raised $47,200 donated by more than 800 backers.
"We fronted money for the parade that we never got the chance to make back. This is a huge obstacle for our tiny not-for-profit arts organization," organizers said in the online campaign.
"We lost a lot of money this year. We really went down," Matthew Fass, musical director of the parade, said in an online video, "It's looking like we can't have this parade unless we get your support, and we need help from everybody."
Online organizers say that the parade will also provide a much-needed economic boost to the area's local businesses after being hard-hit by the storm.
Often referred to as the Village Halloween Parade, the annual festivities have taken place every year on Halloween since 1973 and include more than 60,000 participants. Two million spectators line a mile-long stretch of 6th Avenue to watch, the online campaign boasts.
"It's really up to you," Jeanne Fleming, artistic and producing director of the parade for the past 33 years, said in the online video, "We really need your help."
