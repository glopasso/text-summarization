Twelve people were killed and another dozen wounded when a bus fell off South Korea's longest bridge Saturday while trying to avoid a collision with a truck, local media reported.
The bus was headed to Incheon International Airport, west of the capital Seoul, when it crashed through a guard rail and fell about 10 meters (32 feet) from the Incheon Bridge, the Yonhap news agency said.
Police told the news agency that the bus may have lost control while trying to avoid a truck. The truck, in turn, had swerved to avoid colliding with a stalled car in the middle of the bridge.
The Incheon Bridge, at 21.38 km (13.2 miles), is the country's largest.
