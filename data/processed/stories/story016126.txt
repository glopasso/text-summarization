An unstable Middle Eastern country has become a potential battlefield for a proxy war. Today on CNN Student News, hear an explainer on why Yemen is the focus of global concern. We also report on the origins of April Fools' Day, we detail how a 1,000-year-old recipe could cure a modern-day superbug, and we feature a Character Study on a woman who's steering kids to a better life.
