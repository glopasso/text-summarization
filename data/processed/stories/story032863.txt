Federal investigators say they have joined Cleveland Police in their search for a serial rapist, thought to be linked to four rapes and a homicide dating back to 1996.
"We're just hoping by reaching out to the media we can reach more people, and someone will recognize this guy," FBI Special Agent Vicki D. Anderson said Tuesday.
"Obviously we don't want this guy out there making more victims."
Anderson said forensic evidence has linked the man, who remains unidentified, to the four rape victims, one of whom was killed.
Investigators said they discovered the woman's body in February 1997 in a secluded parking lot underneath a truck.
The man's first known attack occurred in May 1996 when authorities say he allegedly abducted, raped and shot a woman, who survived the attack, according to an FBI statement.
On June 18, 1998, the same man apparently raped another woman at knifepoint as she walked home in Cleveland. He allegedly raped again on December 8, 2010.
Authorities say the man's current whereabouts are not clear.

"He's familiar with that area" said Anderson of the Kinsman area of Cleveland where all the attacks occurred.
"It's not a touristy area, or the kind of place where somebody would just drive through to check things out."
The suspect is described as an African-American man in his late 30s or early 40s, who is about 5 feet 8 inches tall and 150 pounds.
The man is also believed to have a large scar on his cheek, authorities say.
The FBI is offering a $10,000 reward for information that will lead to his arrest and prosecution, asking the public to call 1-800-CALL-FBI or the Cleveland Police Department at 216-623-5630.
