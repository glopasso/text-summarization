In focus: OPEC quota cuts
OPEC, which pumps 40 percent of the world oil, is set to announce this week plans to cut its output when it meets in Oran, Algeria.
CEO Naguib Sawiris is expanding his mobile phone services into North Korea, an area where few businessmen venture.
The cut in crude is hoped to stabilize prices and will be the third cut in quotas since September. So what's behind the supply cuts? Is it just a matter of price stability? Or is OPEC trying to protect the cost of future investments?
