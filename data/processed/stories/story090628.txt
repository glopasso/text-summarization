A popular bicycle maker is recalling about 12,000 bicycles after receiving reports of the bike's front fork breaking and causing riders to suffer nasty falls.
A bicycle fork is used to hold the front wheel and allows the rider to steer the bicycle.
Specialized Bicycle Components, which sold the forks on at least 18 different bike models through retailers from 2007 until July, said riders should immediately stop riding the bikes.
Four reports of riders suffering facial fractures and head and shoulder injuries and cuts led to the nationwide recall, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
The forks were manufactured in China by Kinesis and are primarily found on Specialized's Globe bike model, but riders should double-check their forks just to make sure.
The CPSC reports 2008 and 2009 women's and men's Globe model bicycles may also be affected.
Recalled models include the Globe Elite, Globe Sport, Globe Sport Disc, Globe Centrum Comp, Globe Centrum Elite, Globe City 6, Globe Vienna 3, Globe Vienna 3 Disc, Globe Vienna 4, Globe Vienna Deluxe 3, Globe Vienna Deluxe 4, Globe Vienna Deluxe 5 and Globe Vienna Deluxe 6 bicycles.
The bicycles were sold in various colors, including gun, silver, black, khaki, navy, bone, blue, charcoal, burgundy and gold. The brand name "Specialized" is on the lower frame tube and the model name is on various locations on the bicycle frame.
The company said riders can take the defective bicycles to any authorized Specialized retailer for no-cost installation of a free replacement fork.
