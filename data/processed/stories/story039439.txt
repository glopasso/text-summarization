It's a bust for actor Ben Affleck at one Las Vegas casino.
The actor was "banned from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock casino in Las Vegas," a source close to Affleck told CNN on Friday.
Affleck was "not booted" from the casino as other reports have indicated, the source said. Rather, the source says, he was asked to leave after casino security told him: "You are too good at the game."
The actor was told he could play other games at the casino, the source said.
The Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment about the Tuesday incident.
The source did not say whether casino security accused Affleck of card counting, which is not a crime. It is frowned on by casinos, and it can lead to a ban by a gambling establishment.
Affleck was in Las Vegas with his wife for a quick getaway before the actor begins shooting "Batman vs. Superman," the source said. Affleck has been cast as Bruce Wayne in the upcoming film.
