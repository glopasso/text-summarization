To celebrate International Women's Day, CNN's Leading Women is inviting you to a Tweetchat to discuss how we can bring about gender equality and build a better world and future for women.
Leading Women connects you to extraordinary women of our time. Join CNN's Leading Women team and special guests Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Tawakkol Karman,  Anne-Marie Slaughter, president and CEO of the New America Foundation and Laura Bates, founder of The Everyday Sexism Project for this TweetChat on Friday March 7 at 5pm ET/10pm GMT.
The conversation will focus on what gender equality means for women today and what practical steps we can take to make parity a reality for all. The discussion topic was inspired by our CNN iReport assignment where we asked you what kind of world you'd like to build.
