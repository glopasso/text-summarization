(EW.com) -- There are less than 24 days left until the theatrical release of The Hunger Games (did you hear that EW is the official sponsor of District 7?), and in celebration of the countdown, Lionsgate has announced 24 advanced screenings of the film to coincide with the story's 24 tributes fighting to the death.
"Fans can show their support for #HungerGames24 by visiting Screenings.TheHungerGamesMovie.com and tweeting a unique hashtag assigned to their closest city to unlock Advance Screening locations. Starting tomorrow, March 1, the top four cities with the most Twitter volume will be announced each day and fans will then be able to enter to win tickets to those locations," Lionsgate said in a release.
In addition, on March 10, the first customers to purchase any Nook device at select Barnes & Noble stores will receive two complimentary tickets to the official Advance Screening on March 21 (while supplies last). You can find participating Barnes & Noble stores here.
The social media marketing campaign echoes the milestones from past countdowns: #HungerGames100, #HungerGames74 and #HungerGames50. But how many more hashtag activities can fans take before the release?
At least one, tribute friends. At least one.
