Sometimes, ensuring a green future means having to correct man-made mistakes of the past.
Back in the 1950s, a U.S. government project drained one of the largest wetlands in the world.
It caused such a great environmental problem, the solution became clear: the Florida Everglades must be restored.
CNN Special Correspondent Philippe Cousteau travels to this unique environment to see the early results of the largest ecosystem restoration project in history.
Roads are being diverted, water pump schedules are changing and endangered wildlife is being monitored -- all in an effort to give nature a chance to return to its original form.
This unique ecosystem is a model for other habitat restoration projects, and could predict the future of environmental rehabilitation worldwide.
