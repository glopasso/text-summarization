Johns Hopkins Health System has agreed to pay $190 million to settle the case of a gynecologist who secretly photographed and recorded his patients.
The doctor committed suicide after confessing to the clandestine photos and recordings.
"We have come to an agreement that the plaintiffs' attorneys and Johns Hopkins Health System believe is fair and properly balances the concerns of thousands of plaintiffs with obligations the Health System has to provide ongoing and superior care to the community.
"It is our hope that this settlement -- and findings by law enforcement that images were not shared -- helps those affected achieve a measure of closure," Johns Hopkins said in a statement Monday.
The dollar figure of the settlement was provided by hospital spokeswoman Kim Hoppe.
Dr. Nikita Levy was fired in 2013 after 25 years at Johns Hopkins. He was found out after a colleague reported her suspicion that Levy was secretly recording his patients using a pen-like camera, which he wore around his neck.
Levy confessed and police searched his house. They found multiple computer servers and computers full of naked patient pictures and videos.
As many as 8,000 women and girls were included in the case, according to plaintiffs' attorney Jonathan Schochor.
"We are hoping this is a major step in putting this all behind us," he said.
Hopkins said insurance would cover the cost of the settlement.
"We assure you that one individual does not define Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins is defined by the tens of thousands of employees who come to work determined to provide world-class care for our patients and their families," the hospital said in its statement.
