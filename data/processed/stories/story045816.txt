(CNN Student News) -- November 12, 2014
International and interplanetary are two words that describe today's show! We're traveling from China, where the APEC summit is taking place, to West Africa, where one nation is seeing some progress against Ebola. We're featuring a random fact about the 13th state, and we're setting our sights on a comet, where European scientists are hoping to land a spacecraft for the first time.
