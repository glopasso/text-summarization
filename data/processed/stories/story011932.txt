(CNN)Eight crew members are missing after a cargo vessel overturned off the coast of Scotland, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said late Saturday.
The search for the crew was suspended Sunday night with no sign of them, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency said. A search operation that included a helicopter, coast guard rescue teams and a fixed-wing aircraft was unsuccessful, the agency said.
The coast guard in Shetland was notified at 2:30 p.m. that the hull of the Cemfjord was found 11 miles east of Pentland Skerries, the RNLI said.
Photographs showed the vessel in a vertical position, one end jutting from the water.
Meanwhile, 25 crew members were airlifted from a boat that ran aground off the coast of southern England, below Southampton, the Maritime & Coastguard Agency reported.
Helicopters lifted the crew from the car carrier, which listed dramatically to one side.
The ship ran aground on Bramble Bank near the Isle of Wight.
