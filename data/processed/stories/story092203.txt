(CNN)As his military career winds down, Britain's Prince Harry is going to be spending some time down under.
The 30-year-old prince is due to arrive Monday in Australia for a four-week stint with the armed forces there.
Harry "will work and live alongside colleagues in the Australian Army in a number of regiments in Sydney, Darwin and Perth," the Australian Defence Forces said Thursday.
He has already spent time with Australian troops on a number of occasions during his 10-year military career, a spokesman said.
"Prince Harry has trained and served alongside Australian armed forces on operational tours to Afghanistan; he has met them during the Invictus Games; and even trekked to the South Pole with a couple of Australian soldiers," the spokesman said.
The younger son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, Harry is known in the British Army as "Captain Harry Wales," from his official title and name, His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales.
He began his formal military duties in 2005 at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.
Last month, he announced that he would be leaving the armed forces in June, describing the decision as "really tough."
Australian military officials say the prince's program with them will be "challenging."
It will involve training in urban settings and patrolling the Australian bush, as well as aviation activities and fire exercises. He'll also participate in regular activities like physical training and pack marches, the Australian military said.
Harry will also spend time meeting wounded, injured and ill service members in Australia.
"Wounded warriors" are a special interest for Prince Harry. He helped spearhead and continues to champion the Invictus Games, a competition for former military personnel who have been wounded in the line of duty.
Before he reports for duty Monday, the prince will lay a wreath at the war memorial in the Australian capital, Canberra.
During his attachment with the Australian military, Harry will accompany Charles on a trip to Turkey at the end of April for commemorations on the anniversary of the World War I Battle of Gallipoli.
