The two men accused of killing British soldier Lee Rigby in the London neighborhood of Woolwich will stand trial for murder starting on November 18, a judge ruled Friday.
Michael Adebowale, 22, and Michael Adebolajo, 28, appeared in court in London via video conference from separate rooms in jail.
Rigby was killed in a daylight attack a couple of hundred yards from the Royal Artillery Barracks on May 22.
Both men are charged with murder and possession of a firearm, and Adebolajo also is charged with the attempted murder of two police officers.
Adebowale, who was wearing a red T-shirt and pink jogging bottoms, sat with his head down and arms crossed during his video link appearance, while Adebolajo looked straight at the camera.
The latter wore a gray, long-sleeve sweatshirt and had his left arm strapped in a bandage from his wrist to just above the elbow.
Both suspects were hospitalized after their arrest.
The November 18 trial date is preliminary and could change, the court said.
