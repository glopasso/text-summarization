Bayern Munich recorded a comfortable 2-0 win against Borussia Monchengladbach at Borussia Park on Friday as the Bundesliga resumed after its annual winter break.
After being soundly beaten 3-0 by Red Bull Salzburg in a friendly match last weekend, Pep Guardiola had called for his side put the passion back in their play, and they duly delivered against the league's third-place side.
Any nerves traveling Bayern fans were feeling were quickly eased as Mario Gotze scored in the seventh minute, hitting a low first-time shot home from Thomas Muller's cut back.
Despite dominating possession for the rest of the half, Bayern failed to find another opening but they soon had their noses further in front after the break.
Granit Xhaka's blatant handball in the 52nd minute earned the visitors a spot kick with Thomas Muller stepping up to send Marc-Andre ter Stegen the wrong way and double their advantage.
Gladbach immediately set about trying to repair the damage. Patrick Herrmann hit the post with an effort in the 63rd minute before being played in by Raffael two minutes later only scuff his shot.
But it was Bayern who continued to dominate proceedings hogging two thirds of possession for the majority of the match.
In the final ten minutes, Guardiola brought on Arjen Robben who returned to action following a six-week layoff after gashing his knee in December.
The win takes Bayern to 47 points, ten points clear of second-place Leverkusen.
Sami Hyypia's side travel to Freiburg on Saturday while fourth-place Borussia Dortmund will leapfrog Monchengladbach if they beat Augsburg at the Westfalenstadion.
