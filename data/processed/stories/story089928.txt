The impending arrival of fall brings a wave of highly anticipated young adult books. Bloggers have been buzzing for months, readers have been pinning titles to shelves on Goodreads, and reviews are starting to come in for one of the biggest publishing seasons.
There are tons of options to consider, including R.L. Stine's return to Fear Street, the latest from "Pretty Little Liars" author Sara Shepard and Carl Hiaasen's first book for teens. To help you get started, we reviewed titles publishing in September and October with the help of numerous sources (Kirkus, School Library Journal, Booklist, Publishers Weekly, Book Riot and Upcoming Books Blog) and came up our top picks. We chose a mix of debut authors, anticipated continuations of popular series and new titles from fan-favorite authors.
This is by no means a comprehensive list but rather a starting point for your ever-growing "to be read" stack. There's a wealth of diverse authors, topics and subgenres available this fall, and our list only scrapes the surface.
More resources for your "to be read" stack:
• Diversity in YA
• The Young Adult Book Blog Directory (organized by name)
• New York Times
• New Adult fiction releases (listed on Goodreads)
• YALSA (Young Adult Library Services Association)
• YALit (young adult novels organized by release date)
