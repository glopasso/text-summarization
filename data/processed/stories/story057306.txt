A man walked into a North Carolina Target store on Sunday and shot an employee he had had a previous relationship with before turning the gun on himself, police said.
"Target is deeply saddened by the loss of one of our team members and the tragic event that took place at our Apex, North Carolina, store shortly after 11 a.m. Sunday morning," Target spokeswoman Brandy Doyle said in a statement. "The store was immediately evacuated following the incident and we are cooperating fully with law enforcement in its investigation."
Apex police spokeswoman Ann Stephens told CNN the victim and suspect had been in a relationship that ended several years ago. She was in the store at her cash register Sunday morning when he came in and shot her, Stephens said. The man died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, she said.
The store will be closed Sunday "so that we can focus on taking care of our team," Doyle said. Counselors would be made available at the store, she said.
Apex is about 15 miles west of Raleigh, North Carolina.
