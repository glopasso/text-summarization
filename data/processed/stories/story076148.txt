LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Comedian Dane Cook took a somber tone and described a sense of "terrible betrayal" in discussing the recent arrest of his half brother, who is accused of embezzling millions from him.
How does comedian Dane Cook deal with familial betrayal? "Dance. ... You dance."
Cook spoke about the ordeal Thursday on CNN's "Larry King Live."
"It's a terrible betrayal. But hopefully justice will be served and I can move on with my life," Cook said.
Cook's half brother, Darryl McCauley, has been accused of embezzling millions from Cook while he was the Boston-area comic's manager.
McCauley was arrested in December and charged with larceny, forgery and other crimes, according to authorities in Boston, Massachusetts.
McCauley is accused of transferring Cook's money into his own account. And in one case, McCauley is accused of forging a $3 million dollar check written on Cook's account, according to the Massachusetts attorney general's office.
McCauley is in jail awaiting trial and has pleaded not guilty. CNN's calls to McCauley's attorney were not returned.

"I worked with my only half brother for several years. Woke up one day and a lot of stuff missing," Cook said. "There is a good chunk of money that is certainly not accounted for. That's all I can say about it at this point."
King asked Cook how he deals with his sense of betrayal.
"Dance. Larry, you dance," Cook said with a smile.
