Jody Lee Hunt, the suspect in the fatal shootings of four people in West Virginia's Monongalia County on Monday, has been located and is dead, the county's Homeland Security Emergency Management Agency and state police said.
The agencies offered no details about how the suspect died or where he was found.
There was a search for Hunt, who was suspected of killing four people in three locations in Monongalia County, in the northeast part of the state.
At least one of the shootings happened in Westover, in Monongalia County, and another shooting was reported in an unincorporated part of the county.
"Mr. Hunt did know each of these victims and we do have some key pieces of evidence that do point to him as being the suspect, including his social media traffic as well," State Police Lt. Michael Baylous told CNN affiliate WTAE. "We have an idea why this may have occurred, but we're not in a position where we're ready to release this as of yet."
