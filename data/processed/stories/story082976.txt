(CNN)  -- Brothers Wladimir and Vitali Klitschko have sent Britain's WBA world heavyweight champion David Haye a New Year message, saying they are both ready to fight him in 2011.
Wladimir holds three of the current world heavyweight belts, Vitali has the prestigious WBC title, and Haye the other.
Match-ups between Haye and the Ukrainian pair would help unify the heavyweight crown as well as being a money-spinner.
Haye, who has made two successful defenses of his title, was due to fight Wladimir in 2009, but pulled out with a back injury.
Meanwhile, Wladimir's bout with another Briton, Dereck Chisora, was called off earlier this month, with the triple champion citing injury, paving the way for an early clash with Haye.
"We promise that in 2011 the fight against Haye will come," read the statement, released through Bild.de.
"We want this fight at all costs. He may choose against which of us he wants us to step into the ring to lose his world title."
Haye's manager Adam Booth told the Press Association. "We are now perfectly positioned to get together and make this fight with Wladimir Klitschko.
"Despite the fact we know we bring more UK television money to the table, David and I are happy to split the entire pot 50-50 and grant Wladimir the deal he has wanted since day one."
Vitali Klitschko said on Tuesday that his brother would be the first to take on the 30-year-old Haye, with him waiting in the wings.
Chisora, upset when his fight with Wladimir Klitschko was pulled, has been promised another opportunity, but they may now have to wait.
In world title action Sunday, Japan's Koki Kameda won the vacant World Boxing Association (WBA) bantamweight title by beating Alexander Munoz of Venezuela by a unanimous decision.
The three judges scored it 115-111, 116-109 and 117-109, all in favor of Kameda.
Kameda is the first Japanese boxer to win three world titles, following the WBA light flyweight title and the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight crown.
