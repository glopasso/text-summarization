Two foreign workers with an international aid organization were shot and killed in the western Afghanistan city of Herat on Thursday, the provincial governor said.
The women, who were believed to be Finnish, worked for the International Assistance Mission, said Governor Sayed Fazlullah Wahidi said.
They were riding a taxi through the city when men in a motorbike attacked them and fled, Wahidi said.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the shooting.
The International Assistance Mission is a Christian aid group that has been working in Afghanistan since 1966, primarily in the areas of health and economic development.
It bills itself as "the longest continually serving NGO in the country."
In 2010, 10 workers with the mission - six Americans, two Afghans, a Briton and a German -- were killed by gunmen in Badakhshan, a remote northeastern region of the country.
