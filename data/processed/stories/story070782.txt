Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife. It can lead to some unexpected consequences.
A Tennessee man found this out the hard way when a woman dipped in his pool, naked, as her husband robbed his home.
As he gawked at the swimmer for a good 20 minutes, the burglar got to work.
He stole jewelry, medication and a firearm from the home in Crossville on June 27, CNN affiliate WKRN reported.
How it started
The couple, who live nearby, approached Stephen Amaral, with the wife asking if she could swim in his pool.
The wife sent her husband to get her cigarettes, then asked Amaral if he would be bothered if she swam naked.
Not a problem, Amaral said.
"I went and got her a towel, she dried off and all of a sudden she was soaking wet again," Amaral told the affiliate. "I escorted her outside and invited her to church, but she said she didn't have time for that, she wasn't ready for that."
Sentimental value
Amaral said not only did he feel violated, he lost an item that had sentimental value.
The gun was a service weapon, used while he was a Mississippi deputy. He had planned to pass it down to his grandchildren, he said.
Two suspects have been identified, presumably clothed, but no arrests have been made. The estimated cost of the stolen items: $2,000.
That's a pretty steep price for a pool show.
