Six people suffered minor burns after a fire broke out in the observation deck at New York City's Rockefeller Center Sunday night, a fire official said.
A camera on an elevated part of the observation deck caught fire, sending embers falling onto people below, New York City Fire Department spokesman Khalid Baylor said.
Five adults were injured but refused treatment at the scene, and one child was transported to New York Presbyterian Hospital with minor injuries, Baylor said. The blaze was extinguished before firefighters arrived, he said.
The fire took place at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which houses the headquarters of NBC and the Top of the Rock Observation Deck, a popular tourist attraction.
