A 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck just over 150 kilometers (93 miles) northwest off the coast of Ternate, Indonesia, on Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey reported.
The quake struck at 10:31 a.m. local time at a depth of 35 kilometers (21.7 miles), according to the USGS, which initially called it a 7.3-magnitude quake.
It was centered 156 kilometers east-northeast of Bitung, Indonesia, and 164 kilometers west of Tobelo in the same South Asian nation.
The National Weather Service's Pacific Tsunami Warning Center noted that the quake did not produce any destructive tsunami waves, though minor sea level fluctuations in some coastal areas were possible.
