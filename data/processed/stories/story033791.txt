Five males armed with guns and sledgehammers robbed a jewelry store at a Memphis, Tennessee, mall Saturday night, prompting shoppers and workers to hide amid the chaos, police said.
The robbers targeted Reeds Jewelers in Wolfchase Galleria around 7:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET), Memphis police spokeswoman Alyssa Macon-Moore said.
The suspects were wearing black clothing -- including hooded sweatshirts -- as they carried guns and sledgehamers into the store.
"There are no reported injuries at this time," Macon-Moore said about an hour later. "The scene is active."
She said that there were reports of gunshots, and Twitter contained various posts indicating that might have happened.
But the mall's general manager, A.J. Coffee, said, "There were no shots fired."
After the incident, police received "numerous calls from people in the mall hiding and inside other businesses," according to Macon-Moore.
It was not immediately known what, if anything, the alleged assailants stole, where they went or whether any had been taken into custody.
