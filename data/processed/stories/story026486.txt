It's Manning vs. Manning, Eli vs. Peyton, New York Giants vs. Denver Broncos. Less brother in arms more grappling brothers.
This weekend the NFL's most high-profile sibling rivalry is reignited, as two brothers who first played football together in their New Orleans front yard go head-to-head in the big league.
But don't expect any animosity between the two Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks.
"I'm proud of Peyton, he's proud of me and we've worked hard to get to this point and into the NFL," younger brother Eli, 32, told CNN as his Giants prepare to welcome Peyton's Broncos on Sunday.
"We support each other and we want each other to play well each year. Just seeing him before the game, shaking his hand and just talking for those few minutes are special moments, that's what you'll remember down the road."
The brothers have met on two previous occasions, when Peyton was playing for the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 and 2010. Peyton beat his little brother on both occasions.
But Eli has won most when it counts. He has two Super Bowls rings, one more than his big brother.
Caught in the middle at MetLife Stadium will be their parents. When both your boys are going toe-to-toe, who do you cheer for?
"I think they'll just root for offense, a high-scoring game," replied Eli. "Both quarterbacks did everything they could but something happens where one team loses but it's still some sort of moral victory, if that exists."
The two brothers had contrasting results in week one of the NFL regular season.
The Broncos beat the Baltimore Ravens 49-27, while the Giants went down 36-31 at the Dallas Cowboys.
