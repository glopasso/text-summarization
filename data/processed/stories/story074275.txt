Kenyan fighter jets hit an Al-Shabaab camp in Somalia on Friday, killing at least 30 militants, the Kenya Defence Forces said.
The attack took place while the militants met at the camp in Garbarahey in Somalia's western Gedo region near the border with Kenya, the Kenya Defence Forces said on its official Twitter feed.
An initial assessment indicates that "key commanders" were among the fatalities.
Scores of others escaped with multiple injuries, the military said, and vehicles and other assets were destroyed in the raid.
Al-Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked organization that the U.S. government calls a terrorist group, was behind the deadly siege last September of a shopping mall in Nairobi, Kenya.
Kenyan officials say the terror group has used its camps to train operatives, including attackers who targeted the Westgate Mall.
The radical Islamist group, which controls parts of Somalia, hopes to topple the leadership and turn the country into a fundamentalist Islamist state.
The country has struggled to achieve an effective central government since a dictator's overthrow two decades ago.
