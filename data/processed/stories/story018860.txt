Tiger Woods has not given up hope of teeing off at the Masters later this month.
The world No. 1 is a quadruple winner of the year's first major and he has never missed the tournament since making his debut at Augusta in 1995.
A back injury looked to have ended Woods' 19-year run but the American says it's too soon to write him off for the tournament which runs from April 10-13.
"For Augusta, it's actually still a little too soon, to be honest with you," the 38-year-old told reporters.
Fourteen-time major winner Woods was forced to stop playing during the final round of the Honda Classic on March 2. He tried to return to the course at Doral the following week, but his back prevented him from defending the title he won in 2013.
"I've had a couple weeks off and getting treatment and just working on trying to get ready for Augusta," added Woods. "As of right now, it's still too soon, which is, as I said, pretty frustrating."
Woods won his first major at the Masters back in 1997. He last slipped on the green jacket in 2005 and he hasn't won one of the sport's four marquee tournaments since triumphing at the U.S. Open in 2008.
