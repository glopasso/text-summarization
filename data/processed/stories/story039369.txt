(CNN)One man's trash is another puppet's treasure.
In a new video, Seattle rapper Macklemore moonlights as a malodorous version of himself, aptly named Mucklemore, on Sesame Street for a "gross and awesome" rendition of his hit song "Thrift Shop" with the show's resident Grouches.
Though the Sesame Street version parodies Dumpster diving as a fetid way to thrift of sorts, the lyrics like "I'm going shopping / Looking for some rubbish" are decidedly cleaner for the show's preschool audience.
Macklemore, alongside producer Ryan Lewis, won four Grammys in 2013, including one for "Thrift Shop" as best rap song.
