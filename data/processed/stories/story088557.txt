The start of the 2012 MotoGP has been brought forward by one week, with the motorcycling's elite championship now set to begin on April 8.
Australian world champion Casey Stoner and his fellow riders will begin next year's campaign in Doha for the Qatar Grand Prix, before heading to the Spanish town of Jerez on April 29.
The Saschenring Circuit is also on the calendar, subject to a contract being signed between the venue and the sport's organizers.
The Portuguese circuit of Estoril is due to stage a grand prix on May 6, but is also yet to sign a deal.
The Spanish port city of Valencia will host the season-ending race on November 11.
For the first time since 1986, a MotoGP world championship will begin without the Japanese manufacturer Suzuki on the grid.
