Georgia businessman and former congressman Howard "Bo" Callaway was in intensive care at an Atlanta hospital Sunday after surgery following a cerebral hemorrhage, according to officials of Callaway Gardens, a 13,000-acre vacation resort and preserve created by Callaway and his parents.
The 85-year-old Callaway was hospitalized in his hometown of Columbus, Georgia, last week after complaining of a severe headache. He was subsequently taken to Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, according to Callaway Gardens officials, where doctors determined he had a cerebral hemorrhage, which is bleeding on the brain.
Callaway, a Republican, is a former secretary of the Army and was a congressman from Georgia for one term in the 1960s. He ran unsuccessfully for governor of Georgia in 1966 and later served on the executive committee of the Republican National Committee.
Callaway and his parents created Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Georgia, near Columbus, 60 years ago.
