(CNN)At the rate Marvel is going, all of its comic book characters will have their own movie, maybe two.
"Ant-Man" is the latest to join the studio's movie superhero ranks. Marvel just unveiled the trailer this week.
The character is little-known outside of hardcore fans, much like last summer's "Guardians of the Galaxy" franchise, which turned out to be a big hit.
Playing Ant-Man is Paul Rudd, an actor largely known for his comedic chops. Rudd's character, the troubled Scott Lang, is recruited by Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), to wear the shrinking Ant-Man suit.
A keen sense of humor might be just what's needed for this superhero, who becomes teeny tiny, but powerful, in his pursuit of justice.
However, unlike "Guardians," reaction to the trailer from social media was decidedly mixed.
"Ant-Man" hits theaters on July 17.
