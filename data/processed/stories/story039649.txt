New Jersey's second winning ticket in the recent $448 million Powerball lottery jackpot has been presented and a third of the big prize claimed, state lottery officials said Monday.
Having two winning jackpot tickets in the same state is rare -- the last time anything close to that happened was December 22, 1993, when two players in Washington, D.C., had winning tickets.
Three winning tickets were sold in the August 7 Powerball draw -- two in New Jersey and one in Minnesota.

Mario Scarnici, of Monmouth Junction, New Jersey, claimed the final third, New Jersey officials said.
Scarnici purchased his winning ticket at a Super Stop and Shop store. "I go in the store and buy a newspaper and lottery tickets," said Scarnici, who will distribute to his two adult sons some of the $62 million he chose to receive in cash, after federal and state taxes were withheld.
The other New Jersey jackpot winner was a jointly-held ticket claimed by a group of New Jersey co-workers on August 12. Called the "Ocean's 16," several winners suffered property losses in Superstorm Sandy, and one is the daughter of a man who helped write New Jersey's lottery law.
