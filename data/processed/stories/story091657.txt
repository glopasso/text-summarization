The third body recovered in Yosemite National Park near where three hikers were swept over a waterfall in July has been identified as missing 21-year-old Ramina Badal, park officials said Tuesday.
The bodies of the other two hikers had previously been identified.
In July, witnesses said the three -- two men and a woman -- climbed over the guardrail at the top of a trail and went into the gushing river that feeds the waterfall, known as Vernal Fall. They were quickly swept over.
Park officials had said previously that a body found by a park ranger on November 29 was determined to be that of Ninos Yacoub, 27, of Turlock, California. His body was found in the Merced River about half a mile below the base of the waterfall.

Yacoub was with Hormiz David, 22, of Modesto, California, and Badal, of Manteca, California, when the three disappeared. David's body was recovered in August about 240 feet from the base of the waterfall.
Badal's body was found Saturday in the same general location where Yacoub's body was discovered, park officials said.
