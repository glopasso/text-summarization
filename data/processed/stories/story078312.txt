India batsman Sachin Tendulkar became the first player in history to score 2,000 runs at the Cricket World Cup, as the hosts eased to a five-wicket win over the Netherlands on Wednesday.
Chasing a target of 189 runs to win, India booked their place in the quarterfinals of the tournament with 13 overs to spare in Delhi.
Tendulkar, 37, was playing in his 40th World Cup match and reached a score of 27 before he was caught by Bradley Kruger off the bowling of Pieter Seelaar.
Nicknamed "the little master", Tendulkar made his World Cup debut in 1992 and has hit five centuries and 13 fifties in cricket's premier 50-over competition.
Dutch skipper Peter Borren was top scorer for the minnows as he registered a score of 38 off 36 deliveries.
Zaheer Khan was the pick of the Indian bowlers with three wickets for just 20 runs as Netherlands were dismissed inside 47 overs.
India made an awkward start to their response after three wickets from Seelar left the hosts in a worrying position on 82 for three.
But left-handed batsman Yuvraj Singh steadied the ship for India with a half-century off 73 balls.
The victory leaves India top of Group A with seven points and assured of their place in the next phase of the competition.
