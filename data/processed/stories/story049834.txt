(CNN)  -- South African paceman Dale Steyn took four wickets as India struggled to 183 for six wickets on a truncated first day of the second Test at Kingsmead on Sunday.
For the second successive match of the three-Test series, India were sent in to bat in helpful bowling conditions for the home side and again struggled.
Styen, wth his pace and movement, proved a particular handful after the start was delayed by rain.
India, the world's No.1-ranked Test team, need a win to keep the series alive after a crushing defeat at Centurion, but showed little signs of a revival.

Steyn claimed both openers, Virender Sehwag (25) and Murali Vijay (19), in a spell of two for 19 in eight overs before lunch and added the wickets of Rahul Dravid (25) and VVS Laxman (38) during the afternoon session.
Left-armer Lonwabo Tsotsobe chipped in with the prize scalp Sachin Tendulkar, caught behind for 13 in the first over after lunch.
Tendulkar made his 50th Test century to provide rare cheer  for India in their innings defeat in the first match, but could not repeat his heroics.
Tsotsobe claimed his second wicket just before tea as he removed Cheteshwar Pujara for 19.
He also caught Laxman superbly off Steyn's bowling as India reached tea on 168 for six wickets.
Only a few overs were possible in the final session before bad light brought a premature close with Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni progressing to 20 not out and Harbhajan Singh on 15
India made three changes with Vijay, Pujara and Zaheer Khan coming in for the injured Gautam Gambhir, Suresh Raina and Jaidev Unadkat with South Africa keeping faith with the same team.
