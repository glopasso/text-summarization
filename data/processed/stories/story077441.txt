(EW.com) -- Attention lovers of post-apocalyptic wastelands, biker gangs, and Tom Hardy: "Mad Max: Fury Road" is set to hit theaters on May 15, 2015 — almost exactly 30 years after "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" was released.
Warner Bros. announced release plans Wednesday for the 3-D movie.
Blu-Ray review - 'Mad Max' trilogy
Starring Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron, "Mad Max: Fury Road" is reportedly a re-imagining of George Miller's 1979 film, which launched Mel Gibson's career. Miller, who also directed 1981′s "Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior" and 1985′s "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome," returned to write, direct, and produce this fourth installment. But, beyond Theron's drastic hair change and the tease of a Gibson cameo, little is known about the plot. Nicholas Hoult, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Zoë Kravitz, and Riley Keough also star.
The current slate of May 2015 releases include "Disney's Avengers: Age of Ultron" (May 1) and "Tomorrowland" (May 22), Fox's Paul Feig/Melissa McCarthy comedy "Susan Cooper" (May 22), and Paramount's animated pic "Monster Trucks" (May 29).
The three previous Mad Max films grossed nearly $69 million domestically, not adjusted for inflation.
