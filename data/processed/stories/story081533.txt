For the second time in two weeks, a US Airways flight had to change course after crew members fell ill.
Flight 715 from Venice, Italy, to Philadelphia was diverted to Ireland on Monday after five flight attendants and a passenger reportedly had medical issues, US Airways said in a statement.
The Airbus A330-200 had 238 passengers and 12 crew members on board. The airline said it was booking passengers on other flights to Philadelphia.
It was not clear what kinds of medical issues the flight attendants and passenger had.
If the incident sounds familiar, it's because another US Airways flight taking the same route was diverted to the same airport for the same reason nine days earlier.
On May 10, A US Airways flight en route from Venice to Philadelphia was diverted to Dublin Airport after nine flight attendants became ill, officials said.
The nine flight attendants on that flight complained of nausea, watery eyes and dizziness, Irish health officials said.
The pilots switched gears over the Atlantic Ocean to make the emergency landing in Ireland.
The flight attendants were evaluated, released and then returned to Philadelphia, US Airways spokeswoman Michelle Mohr said.
