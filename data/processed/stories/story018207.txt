More than 100 people attempting to illegally cross into the United States from Mexico over the weekend threw rocks and bottles at U.S. Border Patrol agents trying to stop them, the agency said Monday.
No one was seriously injured.
The attempted crossing occurred a short distance from the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California.
The group ignored orders to stop from a Border Patrol agent standing watch just north of the border. The agent fired pellets containing pepper powder in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the group's advance, the Border Patrol said. Several other agents responded.
"The crowd became increasingly unruly and began throwing rocks and bottles," the agency said. Several agents were struck, including one who was hit in head with a full water bottle.
The response of force from the border agents "eventually caused the group to return to Mexico and disperse."
No one was arrested.
