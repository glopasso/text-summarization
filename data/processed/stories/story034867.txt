(EW.com) -- Now that we all know that Robert Galbraith is J.K. Rowling's pseudonym, there's no way the sequel to last year's surprise best-seller "The Cuckoo's Calling" will spend any time in obscurity.
"The Silkworm" will debut in the U.K. on June 19 and in the U.S. on June 24. Here's the official plot description from Mulholland Books:
J.K. Rowling admits Hermione didn't really belong with Ron
"When novelist Owen Quine goes missing, his wife calls in private detective Cormoran Strike. At first, Mrs. Quine just thinks her husband has gone off by himself for a few daysâ€”as he has done beforeâ€”and she wants Strike to find him and bring him home.
But as Strike investigates, it becomes clear that there is more to Quine's disappearance than his wife realizes. The novelist has just completed a manuscript featuring poisonous pen-portraits of almost everyone he knows. If the novel were to be published, it would ruin livesâ€”meaning that there are a lot of people who might want him silenced.
J.K. Rowling talks single parenthood
When Quine is found brutally murdered under bizarre circumstances, it becomes a race against time to understand the motivation of a ruthless killer, a killer unlike any Strike has encountered before ..."
