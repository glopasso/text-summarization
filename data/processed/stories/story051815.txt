One of three inmates who escaped from an Indiana maximum-security prison was captured Monday about eight miles away in southwestern Michigan, officials said.

Charles Smith, 48, who was serving time on a murder charge, was captured in Grand Beach, Michigan, near the vacation home of Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago, Illinois.
Daley said he was inside with his wife and three grandchildren at the time of the capture.
Smith and another of the escapees were spotted walking near the house at 5:30 a.m. by a Chicago police officer assigned to Daley's security detail, the mayor said.
"I think they were lost, and they happened to pass in the vicinity," Daley said.
Though Smith was captured and handed over to the Grand Beach Police Department, the other man escaped into the woods, where police have been searching, Daley said.
Police urged residents to be on alert.
"I have residents in this area calling their neighbors and telling everybody, stay inside, keep their children inside and watch the news for updates," Dan Schroeder of the Grand Beach Police Department told CNN affiliate WLS on Monday.
Smith escaped from the prison in Michigan City on Sunday with convicted murderer Mark Booher, 46, and convicted rapist Lance Battreal, 45, said John Schrader, a public information officer with the Indiana Department of Corrections.
"It appears they escaped by traveling in tunnels under the prison grounds," Schrader said Sunday. "This is a very unusual occurrence."
Smith was sentenced in 1999 to a 95-year sentence for murder.
Battreal was sentenced in 1998 to 50 years for rape, criminal confinement and stalking.
Booher was sentenced in 1999 to 65 years for murder and robbery.
