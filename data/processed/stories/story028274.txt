"High School Musical" star Ashley Tisdale is now Mrs. Christopher French.
The 29-year-old actress married French, the lead singer of the band Annie Automatic, on Monday.
According to E!, Tisdale and French followed in the footsteps of stars like Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Neil Patrick Harris and kept their ceremony relatively private. The reported 100 guests in attendance are said to have been shuttled to the wedding's private venue from a different location in an attempt to keep the nuptials under wraps.
Once the vows were exchanged, Tisdale had no problem sharing the news with the world.
"Best day of my life!" Tisdale posted to Instagram, along with one of her wedding photos. "Introducing Mr and Mrs French Sept 8, 2014 Shot by @corbingurkin."
With another "High School Musical" actress, Vanessa Hudgens, part of the bridal party, the wedding was like a mini cast reunion. One person missing? Zac Efron.
While the actor couldn't make it, he did send the newlyweds a note of congratulations.
Tisdale's apparently been inundated with warm regards.
"Thanks for all your well wishes," Tisdale tweeted Wednesday. "I'm feeling so grateful and blessed. So honored and proud to be Mrs French :) love you all #myhusbandishot."
