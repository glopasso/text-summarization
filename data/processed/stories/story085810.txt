A suspect is in custody in a case involving the beating of a gay man during Detroit's Motor City Pride festival that was caught on cell phone video, according to Detroit police.
The suspect is a juvenile. Police say they are are still looking for help to identify the other men shown in the video beating Christin Howard, a 20-year-old hairdresser, on June 8.
Howard told CNN affiliate WXYZ he was taking a picture with a friend when things suddenly turned violent.
A group of men began to "gay bash" him, he said, hurling anti-gay slurs his way. Then they started to physically attack him.
"I just thought I was going to die. At one point I thought they were going to kill me," Howard said.
The attack left Howard bruised, with a bloody eye, cuts and a broken finger, leaving him unable to sleep or work.
David Wait, chairman of Motor City Pride, called the incident troubling, adding that he'd noticed "record attendance on Sunday and we took steps to increase security." Wait praised police for their "swift efforts" at investigating the crime.
