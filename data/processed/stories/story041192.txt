A group of 150 Iraqi refugees arrived at a Paris airport Saturday aboard a French aircraft that had delivered aid to the war-ravaged nation.
The refugees traveled on a French aircraft that had taken 10 tons of humanitarian aid to Iraq. They were welcomed by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.
France has shipped about 87 tons of humanitarian aid since the start of the crisis in northern Iraq, according to the foreign ministry.
It's also part of a coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, the militant group that calls itself Islamic State.
France used Rafale fighter jets Friday to attack a logistics warehouse used by the terror group in northeastern Iraq, with more operations planned in the next few days, President Francois Hollande said.
