"Star Wars: Episode VII" is preparing to get back to work.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, J.J. Abrams' project is set to resume filming later this month after taking a two week break to allow Harrison Ford time to recover from an injury.

That said, THR notes that it's unclear if Ford is yet ready to return to London for filming. The actor is reprising his role of Han Solo in the project, which also features "Star Wars" actors Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill and a healthy number of newcomers.
"Star Wars: Episode VII" is set to bow on December 18, 2015.
