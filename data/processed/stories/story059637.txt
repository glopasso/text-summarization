"Breaking Bad" addicts who may suffer withdrawal when the AMC drama ends will get a comedic fix with a spinoff featuring criminal lawyer Saul Goodman.
The network announced a licensing agreement with Sony Pictures Television for a new series with the working title "Better Call Saul."
"Plans call for Saul to be a one-hour prequel that will focus on the evolution of the popular Saul Goodman character before he ever became Walter White's lawyer," AMC and Sony said in a joint news release Wednesday.
Bob Odenkirk plays the flashy attorney Saul Goodman, who changed his professional name from Saul McGill so clients would think he was Jewish.
The title "criminal lawyer" has extra meaning for Goodman, who often used extra-legal means to help his clients, including "Breaking Bad" lead character Walter White, a high school chemistry teacher who evolved into a meth manufacturer.
"Hi, I'm Saul Goodman," he says in one of his TV commercials. "Did you know you have rights? The Constitution says you do and so do I. I believe that until proven guilty, every man, woman and child in this country is innocent and that's why I fight for you, Albuquerque."
The announcement did not reveal casting or timing for the series. "Breaking Bad" is in its fifth and final season.
