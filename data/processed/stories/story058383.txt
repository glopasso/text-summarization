The crew of the International Space Station marked Thanksgiving with zero-gravity-friendly packets of smoked turkey, rehydrated cornbread dressing and a Russian side dish high above Earth.
U.S. astronaut Kevin Ford, the commander of the three-man Expedition 34 crew, showed off the menu in a NASA video. He said he and his Russian crew mates, Evgeny Tarelkin and Oleg Novitskiy, would eat the traditional meal in orbit, adding a Russian mashed-potato-and-onion dish to the American holiday's traditional favorites and washing it down with a cranberry-peach drink.
Ford, Tarelkin and Novitskiy arrived at the station in late October for a five-month stint. The previous crew returned home Sunday night -- but not without leaving behind a jar of marshmallow cream for Ford's candied yams.
Three additional members are slated to join the Expedition 34 crew in late December.
What are you thankful for?
Thanksgiving by the numbers
