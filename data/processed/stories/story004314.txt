A new permanent span over Washington state's Skagit River reopened Sunday, some four months after a bridge collapse on Interstate 5.
The bridge's failure in late May sent cars tumbling into the river and severed the state's main artery to Canada, on which trucks carry an estimated $13.9 billion annually in cargo.
A temporary span went up within a few weeks.
NTSB: 'Boom,' then shudder, first sign of problem on bridge
Roughly 70,000 vehicles a day travel on Interstate 5 over the bridge, said the state Department of Transportation, which announced the reopening on its Facebook page.
It posted a time-lapse video, showing crews working through the night to put the new span in place.
Bearing down: How safe is that bridge you're driving over?
