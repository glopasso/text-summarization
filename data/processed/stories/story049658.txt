(CNN)Golf legend Jack Nicklaus proved almost unstoppable in a career which netted him 18 major titles but just maybe his then rivals could have disturbed his concentration on course by tempting him with his favorite treat.
Nicklaus -- nicknamed "The Golden Bear" -- has a particular craving for ice cream and now the 75-year-old American has launched  his own brand with his name emblazoned over the packaging.
The ice cream comes in seven distinct flavors and is made by a Minnesota-based manufacturer for distribution across the United States.
Nicklaus, who retired from competitive golf in 2005, took a leading role in testing the product and told his official website that he relished the task.
"It's no secret that I love ice cream," Nicklaus said.
"Needless to say, I have never had so much fun in the research and development of a product!"
If the new range proves popular and makes a profit, donations from the proceeds will be given to children's charities.
Nicklaus, who racked up 73 wins on the PGA Tour, has built up a business empire which includes golf course design and equipment, real estate and lifestyle products.
He is considered by many experts as golf's all-time greatest player and his major titles tally is four more than achieved by Tiger Woods.
In March, Nicklaus will be presented with a Congressional Gold Medal by the leaders of U.S. House and Senate in recognition of his achievements on and off the course.
It is the highest civilian award the United States Congress can bestow.
