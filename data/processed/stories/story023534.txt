A Chinese man was executed on Tuesday for keeping six women in a dungeon as sex slaves and killing two of them, state media reported.
The official Xinhua news agency said that Li Hao had been convicted of murder, rape, illegal detention, organized prostitution and making pornography for profit in 2012.
The 36-year old dug the dungeon in the basement of a residential compound he bought in 2009, Xinhua said.
The six women Li tricked into coming home with him were held there for between two and 21 months.
Li repeatedly raped the women, forced them to appear in pornographic web shows from March to April 2011 and made them have sex with customers for a brief period, it added.
The death penalty had been approved by the Supreme People's Court, Xinhua said, after a higher court upheld the sentence handed down by the Luoyang Intermediate People's Court in November 2012.
Li was executed "according to law" after meeting relatives in a detention house in Luoyang, Henan province, a statement issued by the Supreme People's Court said, according to Xinhua.
Three of the women held captive were also found guilty of murder over the killings of two of their fellow captives, the report said.
However, the court was lenient in its judgment of the women because of the circumstances in which they were held, finding they acted under instruction, and in one case coercion, from Li.
One of the women was sentenced to three years in prison and the other two were placed on probation.
