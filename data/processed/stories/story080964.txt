At least six people, including a child, were killed in back-to-back explosions Tuesday at a busy market in Karachi, Pakistan, government officials said.
The homemade bombs were planted inside a garbage container and attached to a bicycle at Karachi's Haidari Market, said government official Roshan Ali Sheikh and Iqbal Kazmi, a spokesman for the city's emergency rescue crews.
At least a dozen people were injured in the explosions. Several nearby cars and shops were damaged.
Officials say there is no indication that the blasts were connected to recent protests against the U.S.-made anti-Islam film that has drawn condemnation around the world.
Haidari Market is about a 40-minute drive from the U.S. Consulate in Karachi.
Karachi has long been the scene of deadly turf wars fueled by ethnic and political rivalries.
Police are working to find out who carried out the attack. No one has taken responsibility.
