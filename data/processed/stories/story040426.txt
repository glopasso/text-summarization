The woman who was once the oldest cheerleader in the NFL faces rape charges for alleged sexual encounters with a teenager at a Delaware vacation home.
Former Baltimore Ravens cheerleader Molly Shattuck, 47, turned herself in to authorities on Wednesday and was arraigned on charges of third-degree rape, unlawful sexual contact and providing alcohol to minors, police said.
Shattuck's alleged relationship with the 15-year-old boy "began in the area in which they resided near Baltimore, Maryland, and culminated with Shattuck providing alcohol to minors and engaging in a sexual relationship with the 15-year-old male at a vacation rental home in Bethany Beach, Delaware, over Labor Day weekend," Delaware State Police said.
She has pleaded not guilty and posted $84,000 bail, CNN affiliate WBAL reported.
"This is a difficult situation for everyone involved. Thank you for your time," defense attorney Michelle Lipkowitz said, according to WBAL.
Shattuck became the oldest cheerleader in the NFL when she joined the Ravens' squad in 2005 at age 38.
In 1997, she married Mayo Shattuck III, the former CEO of Constellation Energy. The two are separated and going through a divorce, according to WBAL.
A 2008 profile of Shattuck on the Ravens' website described her as a "well-known civic leader in Baltimore."
That year, she appeared on the FOX reality show "Secret Millionaire," living for a week on low wages in a coal-mining town in eastern Pennsylvania, according to the profile.
Shattuck was nominated for a service award from Maryland's governor's office this year for her work. She also published a book, "Vibrant Living," detailing her 21-day "back-to-basics approach to better health and better habits."
