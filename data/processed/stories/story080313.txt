Venus Williams probably wishes she could play more in Dubai.
The seven-time grand slam winner claimed her first tennis title in two years and her biggest since Dubai in 2010 after defeating France's Alize Cornet 63 60 on Saturday.
Williams has been hindered by Sjogren's Syndrome, injuries and is well into her 30s but the older of the tennis playing Williams sisters can seemingly do no wrong in Dubai, stretching her winning streak to 15 matches.
She was already in command of the first set at 5-3 but then picked it up a notch, not conceding another game.
"I have had a good week," Williams, 33, was quoted as saying by the WTA's website. "Everything is falling together pretty much, is all I can say."
Her performance in Dubai has no doubt left her hoping for better results at the majors in 2014. Williams last reached a grand slam quarterfinal four years ago and her last grand slam title came in 2008.
Cornet was attempting to pull off a rare Williams sisters double after ousting Serena Williams in the semifinals -- only seven players have beaten the siblings in the same tournament.
Despite the defeat, she might return to the top 20 in the rankings next week after a five-year gap.
"Alize is playing great," Williams said. "I think if she continues to play like that, she's going to play deep in a lot of tournaments and improve.
"It's great to see that, because she's a great addition to the game. She brings so much passion on the court.
"I mean, I was fully expecting to play Serena, so for her to get that win was awesome."
