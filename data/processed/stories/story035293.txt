(RealSimple.com) -- Unscientifically speaking, the number of times you're asked, "Are we there yet?" rises and falls in direct relation to how well you keep children engaged.
Sharon Bergen, senior vice president of education at KinderCare Learning Centers, which oversees almost 2,000 early-education programs nationwide, likes these games.
The Leader Game: Everyone in the car gets to be the leader for an hour "in charge of choosing the travel games, the radio station, the DVD, and, if you'd like, the seating arrangements," says Bergen.
I Spy: For kids, run through the alphabet, such as "I spy something that begins with the letter A." For adults, up the challenge with a line like "I spy something German."
