(CNN Student News) -- December 9, 2014
What is profiling, and how is the U.S. government expanding a ban on it? Today's show begins with a look at new guidelines for law enforcement. Economics also factors in today, with U.S. jobs numbers up but wages dragging behind. We'll explain how and why some rhinos are being transported in South Africa, and we'll take a moment to celebrate historic failures.
