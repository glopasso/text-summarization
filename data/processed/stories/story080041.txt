Redmond O'Neal, the son of Oscar-nominated actor Ryan O'Neal and actress Farrah Fawcett, was arrested Sunday morning on drug charges, authorities said.
Redmond O'Neal was stopped at a jail security checkpoint, and volunteered he had drugs, police said.
The younger O'Neal was stopped during a routine search at a jail security checkpoint and he volunteered that he had drugs in his possession, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County sheriff's office.
O'Neal was arrested on charges of bringing narcotics to a jail facility and possessing a controlled substance, Whitmore said. He would not disclose what drugs O'Neal had, but said he was taken to a jail facility about 40 miles north of Los Angeles.
It was not clear whether O'Neal posted bail, which was set at $25,000.
