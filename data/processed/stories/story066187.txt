The suspect in the deadly shooting at Belgium's Jewish Museum was extradited from France to Belgium, a French court official said Tuesday.
He is Mehdi Nemmouche, arrested in France for the May 24 attack. Nemmouche recently spent a year in Syria and is a radicalized Islamist, French officials said.
When French police arrested Nemmouche on May 30, they also seized a Kalashnikov rifle wrapped in a flag bearing the ISIS insignia, according to prosecutors.
A Belgian Federal Police spokeswoman, Tine Hollevoet, confirmed that the 29-year-old Frenchman had been extradited to Belgium on Tuesday morning but could not give further information for security reasons.
Four people were killed in the daytime attack in central Brussels.
Two of the victims were an Israeli couple in their 50s from Tel Aviv, Israel's Foreign Ministry said. The third victim was a French woman and the fourth was a young man.
Images from the museum showed the gunman behind the deadly attack approaching the building, opening fire, and walking away.
