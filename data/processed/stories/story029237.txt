Four people died, two are missing and 110 were injured when a tornado struck Thursday afternoon in northern Argentina, near the border with Paraguay, the state-run Telam news agency reported Friday.
Killed in the tornado were a 1-year-old child, two women ages 19 and 28, and a person 87-years-old, Telam said. The twister touched down in the town of Pozo del Tigre, the news agency said.
Ten of the injured were in grave condition, Telam said. Victims mostly suffered blows to the head, fractured limbs and internal injuries, said provincial health minister Anibal Gomez.
About 70 to 80 percent of the town of 10,000 people was left without electricity and cell phone service, Telam said.
Information on damage to nearby communities, which also have been hit hard by rain, was unavailable early Friday, the news agency said.
Pozo del Tigre residents with damaged homes were housed in schools, a church property and a children's park, according to Telam.
