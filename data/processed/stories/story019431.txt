Sorry sir, but you are not pregnant.
Mila Kunis made a "public service announcement" Tuesday on the late night talk show "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" It all started when the host -- who is expecting a child with his wife Molly McNearney -- told Kunis "My wife and I are pregnant. We are having a baby very soon, as well."
"Oh, you're both having a baby," said Kunis, who is set to have her first child with fiancÃ© Ashton Kutcher. "You and your wife are pregnant?"
She then pulls out a microphone and begins a rant "for all you soon-to-be fathers":
"Stop saying 'we're pregnant,'" she said. "You're not pregnant! Do you have to squeeze a watermelon-sized person out of your lady-hole? No."
The joke ends with Kunis joined on stage by other pregnant women clutching ice cream containers.
You have been warned, Kutcher.
