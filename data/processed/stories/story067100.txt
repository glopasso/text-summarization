A couple accused of kidnapping their eight children from foster care in New York last week have been apprehended.
Shanel Nadal and the biological father of the children were taken into custody in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Monday evening, police said.
The pair awaits extradition to New York. Harrisburg police would not release any information on the whereabouts of the children or their conditions.
Nadal, 28, fled with her seven sons and one daughter from a Queens facility after an authorized visit on September 19, police said.
The abducted boys are all named after their biological father, Nephra Payne, 34.
They are Nephra Payne, 11; Nephra Ceo Payne, 10; Nephra John Payne, 9; Nephra Shalee Payne, 6; Nephra Rahsul Payne, 6; Nephra Umeek Payne, 5; and Nephra Yahmen Payne, 4.
The lone girl was identified as Nefertiti Payne, 11 months.
A statement from the New York City's Administration for Children's Services at the time made no mention of how Nadal escaped or why the children had been placed in foster care.
CNN's Samuel Gardner III, Jason Kessler and Dominique Dodley contributed to this report.
