Thousands of protesters took to the streets and hundreds were detained Saturday in Copenhagen as they demanded a climate-change agreement that would curb greenhouse gas emissions and aid developing countries harmed by pollution.
They marched to the Bella Center in the Danish capital, where the global climate change summit is being held.
More than 900 protesters were detained, police told CNN, but nearly all were released. Only five were charged and will go to court Sunday, police said.
Countries are expected to end negotiations in Copenhagen on an ambitious new climate deal by next Friday, the end of the two-week summit.
Environment ministers came to Copenhagen this weekend for talks, and world leaders are to arrive late next week.
Considerable progress has been made in areas including technology, adaptation and the prevention of deforestation, Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters on Friday. "It is now also time to begin to focus on the big picture."
De Boer hailed the European Union announcement to provide 7.2 billion euros, or $10.6 billion, over the next three years to help developing countries take action on climate change.
EU climate pledge: full story
All 27 EU member states will pledge money in what is regarded as a major effort to reach a climate change deal.
That deal was struck on the second day of a EU summit in Brussels, Belgium, and leaders plan to make the money available in a "fast start" fund for poor nations dealing with rising sea levels, deforestation and other problems related to climate change.
