As China prepares for its most significant leadership transition in decades, CNN is launching its first ever regular series focused on the country, the first by any international television news network. The new monthly show hosted by CNN correspondent and anchor Kristie Lu Stout provides viewers with a unique insider's view of China from within its own borders.
Shot on location in Hong Kong at the historic Hullett House, in each 30-minute show Lu Stout sits down with thought and business leaders from within China's borders for a roundtable discussion about what really drives this world power and economic giant.
With China's leadership transition expected within a month, the first episode delves into the Chinese Communist Party, exploring how membership is obtained, factions within the party, the personality traits of China's presumed next leader, and the impact of the ongoing Bo Xilai scandal.
At the table helping to demystify the Chinese Communist Party is Hung Huang, a celebrated Chinese media personality and publisher brought up among China's political elite, Victor Gao, a former official in the Chinese Foreign Ministry and English translator for Deng Xiaoping and John Pomfret, award-winning journalist and China commentator.
"The world is watching China more than ever and our new show delivers in-depth, intelligent insights on its economic, political and cultural drivers," said Mike McCarthy, Senior Vice President, CNN International. "We're proud to be the first international news network to dedicate a regular show to China, enabling viewers within China's borders and around the world to better understand the country and its people."
"China is a country of dramatic change, political intrigue, and dynamic economic growth," added Kristie Lu Stout, CNN anchor/correspondent and host of 'On China'. "I've been writing and reporting about China since the late 1990s, and the nation continues to fascinate me. I'm excited to host a regular discussion on current affairs and trends inside China."
