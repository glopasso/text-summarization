She's a "grand old flag" and that's exactly why the two men running for president want you to know that all of their official campaign paraphernalia was made in the good old USA.
Those "I bark for Barack" car magnets.
Made in the USA.
The "I'm a Mom for Mitt" window decals.
Made in the USA.
President Barack Obama's re-election campaign even has a "Runway to Win" project by American fashion designers. For $40, folks can paint their tootsies in "Red-y To Win Red," "Victory White" and "Bo Blue." Not to be outdone, the Republican Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney's campaign offers a onesie for tiny tots that is bedecked with an "R" in red, white and blue.
Neither the Obama or Romney campaigns offered comment on the topic beyond confirming that all official merchandise is made in America.
Such patriotic zeal would seem a no-brainer for those in the spotlight. However, this week's brouhaha over U.S. Olympic team gear made in China has some lawmakers on Capitol Hill feeling like the world is, well ... flat.
"I think the Olympic Committee should be ashamed," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Romney further blasted the U.S. Olympic committee saying the shirts should all be put in a pile and burned and that it would better for American athletes to wear shirts with USA hand painted on the front.
Ouch.
When Romney ran the Salt Lake City Olympics, he promoted an affiliated pin commemorating September 11 terrorist attacks.
"We created a little pin and we notified people that we're now going to be selling these pins and the proceeds are going to go (to charity," Romney said at a Virginia fundraiser
Those pins were made in China, according to the Utah State Historical Society's records.
