A series of explosions in western Pakistan killed four people Sunday, including a young boy, authorities said. Fourteen others were wounded.
A blast in Pakistan's volatile Balochistan province left three members of the country's security forces dead, and two more wounded, military and police officials said. The victims were part of a convoy escorting civilians through the Zain Koh area of Dera Bugti, said Ghulam Muhammad Baloch, a police official.
Nine people were wounded when militants lobbed a hand grenade at a shop in the provincial capital of Quetta, speeding away from the blast. No deaths were reported in the attack, but one person was in critical condition, said Nazir Kurd, another police official.
The attacks came just two days after an explosion outside the home of a former lawmaker in Quetta killed 13 people.
Also Sunday, a 7-year-old boy died in a roadside bombing in Pakistan's tribal Bajaur agency, said Islam Zeb, a government official. Three others were wounded in that attack.
