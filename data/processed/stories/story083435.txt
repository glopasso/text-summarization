A high school marching band played at Clark Atlanta University's football game Saturday night after the university's band was suspended over possible hazing, officials said.
The Benjamin E. Mays High School band played during the halftime show at Clark Atlanta's home game against the University of West Alabama, said William Earvin, the high school's band director and conductor.
Clark Atlanta announced Friday that its Mighty Marching Panthers band would be temporarily suspended because of hazing allegations. It said there is no immediate evidence of hazing or other foul play, but it is investigating.
"Even the possibility of hazing is unacceptable under any circumstance," the university said in a statement.
"Ideally, the allegations will prove untrue and the band can return to its planned schedule of performances as quickly as possible," the school said. "However, regardless of the findings, Clark Atlanta is prepared to take whatever actions are necessary to ensure a safe, healthy, nonthreatening experience for our student musicians."
The allegations at Clark Atlanta follow the hazing scandal at Florida A&M University that began with the death of drum major Robert Champion, 26, last November.
FAMU's band director retired in the wake of the scandal and the school's president resigned.
Champion, who was from Decatur, Georgia, just outside Atlanta, died after being beaten during a hazing ritual on a band bus after a FAMU football game.
