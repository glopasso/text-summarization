(EW.com) -- Gwyneth Paltrow will be singing Cee Lo Green's "F-- You" on "Glee" in two weeks, Fox confirmed.
I maintain this is a better song for Mr. Schue, but I'm officially curious. Perhaps it will be country strong!
The song is going to be sanitized to "Forget You," which is so substantially less catchy, and seeing the world's poshest human sing about not being able to afford a Ferrari will provide some interesting cultural dissonance.
But there's a part of me that thinks this could be kind of adorable? If she is all sassy and campy about it? And it's sort of joke-y? Hm.
