Alvaro Quiros triumphed at the Qatar Masters on Sunday when the Spaniard finished three shots clear of former champion Henrik Stenson and Louis Oosthuizen.
Spaniard Quiros clinched his third European Tour title and now looks set for a first appearance at the Masters.
The 26-year-old survived a late scare to card a final-round of three-under-par 69 and finish at 19-under 269 -- a showing that sends him into the world top 30 and opens the door for his Masters debut at Augusta in April.
Swede Stenson's three-putt bogey at the last for a 68 allowed South African overnight leader Oosthuizen to share second with the 2006 champion after a final round of 71.
Stenson, last year's runner-up to Adam Scott, snatched the lead at 16 under with an eagle at the 10th, but Quiros and Oosthuizen -- playing a group behind -- responded with birdies of their own to leave all three tied through 11.
The momentum swung Quiros' way as he birdied the 12th and Oosthuizen dropped a shot to fall two off the pace before the Spaniard extended his lead as he converted from eight feet a hole later.
Stenson put pressure on with birdie of his own at 15 to move within one at 17 under before Quiros wobbled as he sent his three-wood approach from the rough into the water.
Quiros eventually holed from 15-foot putt for bogey, but then birdied 16 and 17 to take a two-stroke lead down the last and claim a third European Tour title.
Oosthuizen had birdied the last to record a second successive runner-up finish, which sees him move up to fifth on the season money list -- a place ahead of Stenson.
Ireland's Damien McGrane carded a bogey-free 67 for fourth at 13 under, while Spaniard Miguel Angel Jimenez's three birdies earned him a 69 and a share of fifth with Dutchman Maarten Lafeber (72).
World number two Sergio Garcia (70) had a share of seventh place at 11 under.
