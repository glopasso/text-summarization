Pennsylvania State Police reported Tuesday a possible sighting of fugitive Eric Matthew Frein, who has been on the run for more than six weeks.
Frein, 31, is accused in the September 12 ambush shooting that left Cpl. Bryon Dickson dead and Trooper Alex T. Douglass wounded outside the Pennsylvania State Police barracks in Blooming Grove.
He has eluded capture despite a large manhunt around Canadensis, Pennsylvania, where his family has a home.
"The possible sighting was by a resident. No further information regarding the sighting will be released at this time," police spokeswoman Connie Devens said in an e-mail.
Buck Hill Falls, a private community in the Pocono Mountains, said that security had been increased after a possible sighting. It urged people living in the community to safeguard themselves and their property.

Police have not spoken about a possible motive, other than that Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. Authorities have said a review of a computer hard drive used by Frein shows that he had planned the attack for years.
The manhunt has involved as many as 1,000 officers at times, some from other states. It has cost several million dollars.
