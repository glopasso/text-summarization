As President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney crisscrossed the country during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign, few people were able to see the candidates in their most candid and unguarded moments, except for their personal photographers.
Several weeks ago, CNN invited each campaign team to submit images from the last week of the race, from Friday, Oct. 26 through Saturday, Nov. 3.
Little did anyone know that the last week would be dominated not by last-minute stops in swing states and wall-to-wall speeches to rally the party faithful, but rather one story: Superstorm Sandy.
Here are images provided exclusively to CNN by the Romney campaign, displayed in chronological order and shot by photographer Eric Draper.
Draper, who served as President George W. Bush's personal photographer and head of the White House Photo Office, joined the Romney campaign this summer.
