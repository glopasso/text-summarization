A man from Uzbekistan living in Alabama was sentenced Friday to almost 16 years in prison for threatening to kill President Barack Obama.
Ulugbek Kodirov, 22, pleaded guilty in February to threatening Obama, providing material support for terrorism and for illegally possessing an automatic weapon.
In his guilty plea, Kodirov said that in 2011 he was communicating with a person he thought was a member of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, a designated terrorist group, and that "Kodirov interpreted these conversations to mean that he should kill President Obama," according to the Justice Department.
Kodirov also admitted speaking to a different person in July 2011 about wanting to kill Obama and possible ways to carry out the act. Kodirov did not realize that person was a confidential source for law enforcement who then introduced Kodirov to someone to help him get weapons. The new contact was actually an undercover agent.
The three men met in a motel room in Leeds, Alabama, on July 13, 2011, and the undercover agent showed Kodirov a machine gun, a sniper rifle with a telescopic sight and four disassembled hand grenades, and asked if he would like any of them to "carry out his plan to kill the President." Kodirov picked the machine gun and the hand grenades, according to the Justice Department.
Kodirov took the weapons and left the meeting but was arrested by agents before he could get out of the building.
Kodirov came to the United States on a student visa in June 2009, but failed to enroll in school. His visa was revoked in April 2010 and from then on he was in the country illegally.
