Which toys will make it into the National Toy Hall of Fame this year? Maybe the Magic 8 Ball, one of 12 finalists announced this week, has the answer.
Each year, the National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester, New York, recognizes toys that have "engaged and delighted multiple generations, inspiring them to learn, create, and discover through play."
The beloved fortune-telling toy is up against stiff competition: bubbles, chess, Clue, Fisher-Price Little People, little green army men, My Little Pony, Nerf toys, Pac-Man, the rubber duck, the scooter and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Two winners will be announced November 7 to join the rarefied company of 51 toys honored in previous years, including Barbie, Mr. Potato Head, Nintendo Game Boy, the bicycle, Silly Putty, the skateboard, Slinky and the baby doll.
