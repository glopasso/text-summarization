(CNN)  -- A former golf professional from Indiana in the United States played an incredible 612 holes in just 16 hours as part of a charity fundraising bid.
Ben Berger accomplished the feat at the Juday Creek Golf Club, beginning his day at 5.29 am local and finishing at sunset at 9.30 pm.
He averaged more than two 18-hole rounds of golf every hour, using a golf cart to speed between his shots.
He was completing a par-four in an average of one minute 30 seconds, only slowing towards the end as pains in his hips started to take a toll.
Berger's play was not too shabby either, picking up 95 birdies and five eagles, the last of which came of his final hole as he chipped in.
Of his 33 rounds, 12 of them were par of better and despite his haste, his worst score was an 82.
Berger was helping to raise money for an autism charity, the "Par for the Cause" event having raised more than $200,000 in its five-year existence.
Impressive though Berger's marathon performance is, according to Guinness World Records the record for the most golf holes in 24 hours with use of a cart is 851, set by Robb James, who achieved his feat at a nine-hole course in Canada.
Berger was a professional at a neighboring club until taking a regular job in a family business.
His wife Stephanie, who is eight months pregnant, was on hand to watch at the end as he finished in superb style to the delight of his gallery of supporters.
"That's the way you finish," he screamed and then hugged his wife who had been standing by him with his putter.
