If you've ever felt the urge to buy an Osama bin Laden action figure and have $2,500 to spare, Nov. 20 could be your lucky day.
The doll, code named "Devil Eyes," is one of three prototypes designed by Donald Levine, the creator of G.I. Joe, back in 2005 as part of a proposed CIA plan to take down the al Qaeda leader. The Washington Post originally reported that the spy agency considered selling demonic bin Laden figurines to scare Afghan children and their parents from supporting bin Laden and al Qaeda.
The CIA rejected the plan after it reviewed the three prototypes, Dean Boyd, CIA spokesperson, confirmed to CNN in June.
"To our knowledge, there were only three individual action figures ever created and these were merely to show what a final product might look like," he said. "Furthermore, the CIA has no knowledge of these action figures being produced or distributed by others."
Two of the dolls are either in the possession of the CIA or the Pentagon, according to the Washington Post. However, one lucky bidder can get his hands on the spare in an online auction by Nate D. Sanders auction on Nov. 20, according to a release Thursday from the auction house. The bidding starts at $2,500.
The action figure, draped in bin Laden's long white robe, comes with two detachable heads. One head is the recognizable face of the al Qaeda leader with his long black beard and white turban. The other shows him as a demon with red skin, green "Devil Eyes" and black facial marks.
