Singer Chris Brown's arrest on a domestic violence charge prompted Wrigley to suspend its Doublemint gum campaign that uses Brown as a spokesman.
"Wrigley is concerned by the serious allegations made against Chris Brown," Wrigley spokeswoman Jennifer Luth said.
Brown was arrested Sunday night in connection with an alleged domestic violence incident in Hollywood early Sunday morning, police said. He was released on a $50,000 bond and given a March 5 court date.
A Doublemint commercial features Brown singing about the gum to the tune of his hit song "Forever."
"We believe Mr. Brown should be afforded the same due process as any citizen," Luth said. "However, we have made the decision to suspend the current advertising featuring Brown and any related marketing communications until the matter is resolved."
