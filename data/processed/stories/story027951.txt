Ousted Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy and 132 others will face trial for escaping from prison in 2011, state media reported Saturday.
Morsy will be tried along with members of the Muslim Brotherhood and Palestinian Hamas, al-Ahram newspaper reported.
He is also charged with raiding other prisons, and killing soldiers and officers in Rafah, it said.
This is the latest in a series of legal woes for the deposed leader.
This week, state media reported that Morsy and 35 Muslim Brotherhood members will be tried for allegedly collaborating with foreign organizations to commit terrorist acts and revealing defense secrets, according to al-Ahram.
Morsy is accused of spying for the Palestinian group Hamas, which the United States classifies as a terrorist organization, and assisting in acts of terror inside Egypt, judicial sources told al-Ahram.
He has been in custody since his ouster in July. He already faces charges of incitement to murder in connection with protests against his rule last year.
Morsy has refused to recognize the court.
