The Farnborough airshow attracts exhibitors and visitors from all around the world and is at the heart of developments in the aviation industry.
Its runways in Hampshire, England have witnessed many aerospace engineering milestones - including the showcase of the first jet airliner, debut of Concorde and the unveiling of the Typhoon combat aircraft.
Initially held every year, Farnborough has been organized biennially since the 1960s, alternating with Paris in hosting the airshow.
