University of Minnesota head football coach Jerry Kill is in stable condition after suffering a seizure on the sideline of a game against New Mexico State on Saturday in Minneapolis, the team doctor said.
"Coach Kill has a history of seizures and he is stable. He has been transported to the hospital and there will be updates thereafter," said Gophers team doctor Pat Smith.
"He has a history of them since his cancer, which has been well controlled through medications," Smith said.
CNN affiliate WCCO in Minnesota reported that Kill suffered the seizure during the final seconds of the game, which New Mexico State would win, 28-21. He was taken off the field by emergency responders.
"There is a history of trouble with dehydration and heat seems to kick that up. It was very hot and humid today. We have to do a better job as a medical staff keeping him hydrated," Smith said.
