The law of supply and demand takes center stage in today's show, as CNN Student News takes an in-depth look at the economics of oil and gas prices. And we haven't forgotten about you civics and government teachers: We discuss the makeup and issues ahead of the 114th U.S. Congress, and we examine what a school day is like inside a war-ravaged Syrian city.
