A strong storm over the Bering Sea -- the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri -- will bring intense winds, massive waves and heavy rain and snow to coastal Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.
But don't ignore it just because it is a sparsely populated area with residents who are accustomed to severe weather. The powerful storm will whip the jet stream, causing a ripple effect that will carry the cold air to the East Coast.
This arctic outbreak will funnel down through Canada over the next week, bringing a deep freeze to the eastern United States, with temperatures forecast 20 degrees below average.
The ripple of frigid air starts in Alaska, where the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri -- which earlier in the week was tied for the strongest storm typhoon of the year based on wind speed  -- have strengthened, though it isn't a typhoon any longer.
Technically, it's called a mid-latitude storm.
The storm carries the energy of the typhoon and its current strength is derived from clashes of hot and cold air. This incredibly strong cyclone will alter the jet stream allowing for the cold air to plunge into the United States next week.
The effects of the cold air will be felt as early as the weekend, as temperatures will cool in the East Coast. But a second cold front with really cold air will make its way into the Upper Midwest Sunday and the East Coast by the end of next week.
That second front will bring snow from Montana to the Great Lakes starting on Sunday. By Wednesday, snow may reach as far north as New England.
The name "Polar Vortex" has been attached in the past to weather like this, but that is a misnomer.
There is a thing called the Polar Vortex, and it is always present in the arctic atmosphere. The current storm is affecting the jet stream and allowing polar air to plunge farther south, but it is not a direct result of the Polar Vortex.
