CNN -- Newly-appointed Aston Villa manager Gerard Houllier will take control of the squad after Saturday's English Premier League match against Bolton Wanderers.
Houllier was presented to the media as Martin O'Neill's successor on September 10, but was unable to begin work with his new club due to his current role with the French Football Federation (FFF), where he is a technical director.
The former Liverpool and Lyon manager's first game in charge will be a Carling Cup clash against Blackburn Rovers on September 22, but he will be present at Villa Park to see Aston Villa take on Bolton this weekend.
Another new appointment is Milovan Rajevac, who has become the new coach of Saudi Arabian side Al Ahli.
The Serbian, who guided Ghana to the quarterfinals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, will face Al Ittihad in his first match on September 16.
