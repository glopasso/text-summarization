He's beaten the best sprinters the world has to offer -- but how would Usain Bolt fare against a Buenos Aires bus?
The six-time Olympic champion from Jamaica is never one to shirk a challenge, even if it means racing something 20 times his size.
But while the bus -- crammed with passengers -- worked through the gears Bolt cruised to victory on 9th of July Avenue in Argentina's capital.
The stunt was part of a drive to encourage more kids to take up athletics with the 27-year-old also racing against a clutch of fellow sprinters overs 120m.
Bolt told a press conference he hoped to be back in South America for the 2016 Rio Olympics to defend his 100m, 200m and 4x100m relay titles for the second time.
"One of my main goals is to go to the Rio Olympics, as I was saying, to do it again," he told reporters.
"To defend my titles and it's never been done three times so, for me, that's me trying to set the bar as high as possible. To just push the barrier."
Bolt, who also holds the 100m and 200m world records, spoke of his first foray into running as part of the drive to boost participation in Argentina
"The first race I actually won was when I was 10-years-old," he explained. "My cricket coach bet me to run at my sportsday -- if won I would get a box lunch and I won. It was great."
Bolt's defeats are few and far between but he revealed the occasional reverse helps to refocus him.
"Losing helps to learn how to motivate myself to learn how to win again," he said. "Winning is happiness for me."
