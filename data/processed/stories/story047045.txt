Farrell noted that the remaining roles were still being locked in as he dropped a few more details about the production.
"I know it will be eight episodes and take around four or five months to shoot," he said. "I know very little about it, but we're shooting in the environs of Los Angeles which is great. It means I get to stay at home and see the kids."
