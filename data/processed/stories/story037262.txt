President Barack Obama has ordered flags on federal buildings to fly at half-staff until the burial next week of Sen. Robert Byrd, except for Independence Day, when they should be flown at full staff to honor the veteran legislator, the White House said Wednesday.
A proclamation issued by Obama made the order "as a mark of respect for the memory and longstanding service of Sen. Robert C. Byrd," who was the longest-serving member of Congress in history.
Byrd, who represented West Virginia, is scheduled to be buried on July 6, and Obama's proclamation said the U.S. flag should fly at half-staff until sunset on that day. At the same time, it called for flying the flag at full staff on July 4 "in honor and tribute to this great patriot."
