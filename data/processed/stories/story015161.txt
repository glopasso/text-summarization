(EW.com) -- Kal Penn could be returning to a regular TV series role.
The "Harold & Kumar" and "House" actor has landed a role in ABC's comedy pilot "Prairie Dogs."
The show is a single camera sitcom from Jackie and Jeff Filgo ("That '70s Show," "The New Adventures of Old Christine") about a lowly cubicle worker named Neil (Penn) who has his identity stolen, only to like the fake life he's been given more than the boring one he was living.
He enlists a con man to help him change his life.
Penn left his role on "House" to work for the Obama administration in 2009, then last year returned to Hollywood. He recently had a recurring role on CBS' "How I Met Your Mother."
Penn joins the previously cast Michaela Watkins ("Saturday Night Live") in the ABC pilot.
