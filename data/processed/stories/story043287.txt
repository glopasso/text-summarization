"While we are proud of the topics the program tackled including childhood obesity, life-after the military, divorce, and addiction we were simply not able to breakthrough the crowded talk show marketplace," said Stephen Brown, exec VP of programming & development for Twentieth Television, in a statement. Twentieth produced Lake's syndicated talk show.

Though she's a veteran talker (she hosted her own show back in the late '90s), Lake has floundered in daytime where so many new female faces are either hosting a new talk show (hi, Katie Couric!) or bringing in new viewers to a returning one (the women of "The Talk").
