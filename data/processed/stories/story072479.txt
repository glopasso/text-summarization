Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman was struck by a car while riding a bicycle Friday in Islamorada, Florida, the state highway patrol said.
The 81-year-old, who was not wearing a helmet, was transported to Ryder Trauma Center in Miami with "serious" injuries, according to the highway patrol.
Hackman was thrown from his bike when a Toyota Tundra pickup struck his rear tire, according to the highway patrol. Alcohol did not play a factor in the crash.
Susan Madore, Hackman's publicist, downplayed the incident, saying, "Gene's fine. ... Just a few bumps and bruises. He is already on his way home."
Hackman, who turns 82 this month, last appeared in a major motion picture in 2004, co-starring with Ray Romano in the comedy "Welcome to Mooseport."
He won an Oscar for best supporting actor for 1992's "Unforgiven" and won the award for best actor in "The French Connection" in 1972.
