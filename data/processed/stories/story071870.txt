Retiring baby boomers are cashing out on their decades of paying into Social Security. The problem? Social Security is no longer running a surplus, worrying many that the entitlement program is in trouble.
In 2036, the Social Security Administration reports that it will no longer have enough money to fully pay out scheduled benefits. Solutions put forth by President Obama's bipartisan fiscal commission, on which Republican vice presidential hopeful Paul Ryan served, include raising the retirement age and reducing benefits for wealthier Americans.
As the debate over how to save Social Security continues, we look at the program by the numbers:
7.8 million - Number of elderly people in the United States in 1934. Approximately 50% of them lacked enough income to support themselves. Only 5% of retired people were receiving pensions.
