As authorities spent weeks looking for accused killer Eric Frein in eastern Pennsylvania, he apparently was using his laptop to access open wireless connections and gain access to the Internet.
According to an application for a search warrant filed by the Pennsylvania State Police, Frein had a Lenovo Thinkpad and two portable storage drives with him when the 31-year-old survivalist and military buff was captured last week at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, Pennsylvania.
Authorities want to know what is on the laptop and on Saturday asked a judge for permission to search the computer.
Frein told authorities he used the laptop and unsecured Wi-Fi accounts during the nearly seven-week long search, the court document says.
A crew from CNN affiliate WNEP drove down the road near where he was taken into custody and found a few homes that could have provided the open access.
One of the websites he could have accessed provided links to listen to police radio traffic, WNEP reported.
The application for the warrant also describes how authorities had already searched a computer from Frein's home and discovered some disturbing Internet searches that went back to November 2012.
The searches included: "how to escape a manhunt," "can police track cell phone" and "ballistics trajectory calculator."
Frein is charged with first-degree murder and other crimes in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove.
He's accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex T. Douglass before melting into the thick Pennsylvania woods.
