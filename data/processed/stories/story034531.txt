FIFA president Sepp Blatter has confirmed that world football's governing body will donate $250,000 to the families of those people killed in last week's football riots in Egypt.
More than 70 people lost their lives after violence erupted at the end of a match between Al Masry and Al Ahly in Port Said.
A bank account has been set up by Al Ahly to help support families who lost loved ones, with Blatter appealing to the world of football to show their support for the north African nation.

Blatter said in a statement: "I stated after the tragedy that this day was a black day for football.
"I'm still very shocked by what happened. Many of the victims were so young and they were also a crucial support for their families, who now need help."
Blatter added: "The football community, including FIFA, must assist its Egyptian brothers and sisters."
Security forces were criticized by many supporters for their apparent lack of urgency as the riots unfolded.
This resulted in further clashes over two days between protesters and Egyptian police, which saw a further 12 poeple killed.
The violence also reignited demands for Egypt's military-led government to make reforms and improve security.
