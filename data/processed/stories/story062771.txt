(EW.com) -- Kris Jenner worked her magic — and familial connections, of course — to land an interview with the typically media-shy Kanye West, the father of her granddaughter North. Kanye stopped by the set of Kris on Monday to tape an hour-long interview that will air this week.
West, who welcomed his first child with girlfriend Kim Kardashian in June, opens up to Jenner about his baby girl, falling in love with Kim, and dealing with the press.
He also addresses President Obama's comments last month about how celebrities like Kanye and Kim have shifted the idea of the American dream. "There was not that window into the lifestyles of the rich and famous," the president said at the time. "Kids weren't monitoring every day what Kim Kardashian was wearing, or where Kanye West was going on vacation, and thinking that somehow that was the mark of success."
"Kris" airs on select Fox stations, including in New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas. Stay tuned for more info on when Kanye's interview will air.
