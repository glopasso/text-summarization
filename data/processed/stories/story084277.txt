A California company is voluntarily recalling 60 packages of walnuts sold only in southern California because they may be contaminated with salmonella.
The product being recalled is: El Guapo Nuez Entera / Shelled Walnuts sold in 1-ounce packages, UPC 4498933144, date code 5527. The code date is embossed on the front of the package under the El Guapo banner.
The company, Mojave Food Corporation, said it is recalling the product because they were informed by the walnut supplier of the salmonella concern.
No illnesses have been reported.
Consumers are asked to destroy the product, and contact the Mojave customer service number at 1-800-995-8906, ext. 114, for a replacement or reimbursement.
Salmonella infections are caused by bacteria and if necessary can be treated with antibiotics, although some strains have become resistant to these drugs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.
Most people infected will develop diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps within a few days of infection, and their illness can last up to a week.
Most recover without any treatment, but some may suffer dehydration and in severe cases require hospitalization.
The youngest and oldest patients and chronically ill people with compromised immune systems are at highest risk for severe complications, according to the National Institutes of Health.
