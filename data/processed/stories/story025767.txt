"All indications are that it was a suicide," Aaron said. A suicide note was found, he said.
Welch played guitar with Fleetwood Mac starting in 1971. He left the group in late 1974, just before Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined the group.
Nicks said in a statement that Welch's death was "devastating."
"I had many great times with him after Lindsey and I joined Fleetwood Mac," singer Nicks said. "He was an amazing guitar player -- he was funny, sweet -- and he was smart.
