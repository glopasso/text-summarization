Devastating floods in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state have killed more than 800 people, according to new government figures.
State authorities said late Sunday that 809 people were killed after flooding and massive mudslides flattened houses and wiped out entire neighborhoods in hillside towns.
The city of Nova Friburgo was the hardest hit, with at least 391 victims, Rio de Janeiro state government said.

The flooding, caused by days of torrential rains, has left thousands of people homeless throughout the state, according to the government's tally.
Other states in the South American country have also seen heavy rainfall. Earlier this month, authorities in neighboring Sao Paulo state said flooding had killed 24 people.
