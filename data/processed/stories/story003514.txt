Hmm, there must be something in the water in New York.
For the third consecutive year, a New York beauty queen has been crowned Miss America.
This time, it was Kira Kazantsev who had the tiara placed atop her perfectly coiffed head.
The 23-year-old Kazantsev's platform is domestic violence. During the question and answer portion of the pageant -- held Sunday at its birthplace of Atlantic City, New Jersey -- she said sexual assault in the military is a problem that needs the attention of lawmakers.
For her talent portion, she sang Pharrell Williams' "Happy" while she kept time by tapping a red plastic cup on the floor, a la Anna Kendrick's character in the movie "Pitch Perfect."
When she was announced the winner, she was handed the crown from last year's Miss America -- and a Miss New York -- Nina Davuluri.
Miss Virginia Courtney Paige Garrett was first runner-up. Miss Arkansas Ashton Jo Campbell was second runner-up.
