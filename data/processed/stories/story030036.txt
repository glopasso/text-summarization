After spending more than a month in a Houston hospital, former President George H.W. Bush might get to leave this week.
"We are hopeful that he can be discharged this coming week, but we're still taking everything one day at a time," spokesman Jim McGrath said Saturday night.
The statement came after Bush's son and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush told a crowd in Vero Beach on Saturday that his father was expected to be released Monday, according to TCPalm.com.
The 41st president was hospitalized on November 23 for bronchitis and remained there while doctors monitored a lingering cough. He has also suffered from "a stubborn fever," McGrath said last week.
While in the hospital, Bush, 88, has cheered on the Texas A&M and the Houston Texans football teams to victories and enjoyed a special performance by the Oak Ridge Boys via telephone. His exchanges with doctors and nurses have included singing, McGrath said.
