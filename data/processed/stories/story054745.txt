(CNN)  -- Uruguay star Diego Forlan said Monday that he is leaving Atletico Madrid and is set to join Serie A Inter Milan.
Forlan, who scored two goals in the final as his country lifted the Copa America this summer, has been with Atletico since 2007, but a posting on the club's official website confirmed his departure.
Forlan, who appeared at a news conference with Atletico president Enrique Cerezo, said the La Liga club would always be in his heart.
But added: "At the age of 33, going to a club like Inter is not an opportunity that comes up often.
"I am happy with the decision that I have taken, it is normal that some players come and others go," Forlan added.
Atletico have set up a special Twitter hash tag so their fans could pay tribute to Forlan, who scored 74 goals in 134 appearances for the club.
He will replace Cameroon striker Samuel Eto'o, who joined Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala from Inter on a massive three-year contract.
Forlan, the player of the tournament at the 2010 World Cup, will sign a two-year deal with the Italian giants, Spanish media reported.
Inter have also signed Italian Under-21 midfielder Andrea Poli from relegated Sampdoria, the Serie A club announced on their official website Monday.
Poli impressed for Samp last season, despite their demotion to Serie B and is rated one of the most promising young players in Italy.
In other transfer news Monday, Paraguay's Roque Santa Cruz has left Manchester City to join La Liga Real Betis on a season-long loan deal.
The 30-year-old Santa Cruz has fallen further down the pecking order at City with the arrival of Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid.
Chelsea midfielder Yossi Benayoun looks set to leave Stamford Bridge, with Arsenal one of the club's linked with the Israeli star.
Benayoun used his Twitter blog to reveal his intentions.
"Negotiation with several team... news soon," tweeted the 31-year-old.
