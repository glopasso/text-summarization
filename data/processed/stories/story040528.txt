(CNN)Sorry, ladies, but he put a ring on it.
The trailer for "Ted 2" came out Thursday, and it's everything you probably imagined.
The film is the sequel to Seth MacFarlane's very successful 2012 film about a foul-mouthed teddy bear. "The Family Guy" creator once again wrote and directed.
This time around, the stuffed animal is getting married, trying to legally prove that he's human and attempting to have a baby via a sperm donation from his best friend, played by Mark Wahlberg.
Yes, that's a lot, we know. The trailer is deemed appropriate for "approved audiences" and is definitely not for those who are adverse to butt crack humor.
In addition to Wahlberg and MacFarlane (who voices Ted), the film stars Amanda Seyfried and Morgan Freeman. "Ted 2" will be in theaters June 26.
