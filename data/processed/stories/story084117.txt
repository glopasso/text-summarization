Canada secured only their second-ever win at the Cricket World Cup on Monday with a five wicket defeat of Kenya.
The match in the Indian capital of Delhi was between two nations searching for their first victory of the tournament, and it was Pubudu Dassanayake's Canada who came out on top after they reached a target of 199 with 27 balls to spare.
The result leaves Kenya bottom of Group A, with Canada one place above them in seventh after picking up their first points of the tournament.
Eldine Baptiste's Kenya team batted for the full 50 overs for the first time at this World Cup, with all-rounder Thomas Odoyo their top scorer after he hit 51 runs off 62 balls.
Canada responded superbly though, and a fourth-wicket stand of 132 runs between captain Ashish Bagai and Jimmy Hansra helped them towards their triumph.
The North American nation's only previous win at cricket's premier 50-over competition was against Bangladesh in 2003.
Canada's next match is against New Zealand, who are currently fourth in Group A with four points, on March 13.
Kenya will go up against reigning champions Australia on the same day at the M.Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru.
Meanwhile, England were hit with an injury blow after it was announced that key batsman Kevin Pietersen will miss the rest of the tournament.
The South-Africa born opener will return to England in order to have surgery on a hernia injury.
"Sad to leave India.. Love the people & the hospitality," Pietersen, 30, said via social-networking website Twitter.
The International Cricket Council have granted England permission to call up 24-year-old Eoin Morgan as a replacement.
Morgan, who represented Ireland in the 2007 World Cup, was initially ruled out of the competition with a finger injury.
