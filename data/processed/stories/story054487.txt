India's Shiv Kapur holds the clubhouse lead at the weather-affected Dutch Open at Hilversum, although over half the field have still to complete their second rounds.
Kapur finished his first round of Friday, after vandalism to some greens, and heavy rain, forced widespread disruption on Thursday.
And he followed his opening four-under-par 66 with a steady 67 to lie one stroke ahead of Briton Gary Orr (66) and South African James Kingston (68).
"I've been driving the ball really well, and on this course there is a big premium on hitting a lot of fairways," 28-year-old Kapur told the official European Tour website.
"The driver has been behaving and I gave myself quite a few chances. Overall I just played quite solid," added Kapur -- who is still seeking his maiden victory on Tour.
Meanwhile, Sweden's Oscar Floren and U.S. Open champion Rory McIlory lie just two shots behind, with Mcilory having to play 27 holes on Friday.
The Northern Irishman began with a level-par 70, but carded six birdies in his second round for a five-under-par 36-hole total of 135.
"I don't feel I drove the ball particularly well. There were a couple of loose shots but I got some lucky breaks," he told reporters.
Of those players still out on the course, Briton Stephen Dodd and joint overnight leader Marcel Siem of Germany head the field on eight-under-par.
Dodd only has five holes to play, but Siem still has seven holes remaining in his second round.
