New York police have charged a man with murder after he allegedly shoved a Bronx resident to his death from a subway platform.
Police arrested Kevin Darden, 34, on Tuesday after the weekend incident in New York City.  He was charged the same night he was detained.
Wai Kuen Kwok, 61, was standing on the platform at the subway station Sunday morning when a man pushed him in front of an oncoming train, authorities said.
First responders pronounced him dead at the scene.
The victim's wife was with him. She was hospitalized for trauma, but was not physically injured.
The suspect then fled the station.
Police would not speculate whether there was an altercation between the victim and the suspect.
