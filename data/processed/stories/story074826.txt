A U.S. Marine allegedly stabbed another Marine to death after a bar fight early Saturday morning across the street from the Marine Barracks in the nation's capital, police said.
The accused attacker has been arrested.
"Information uncovered during the course of the preliminary investigation indicates that there was a verbal exchange, and during the exchange a homophobic slur was heard from the suspect prior to the stabbing," Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement.
The fight began in a bar and spilled into the street, according to Capt. Jack Morton, a spokesman for the Marine Barracks. Two Marine guards on duty outside the Marine Barracks saw the fight and moved in to break it up. They subdued the alleged attacker and helped police take him into custody, Morton said.
D.C. police identified the stabbing victim as 23-year-old Philip Bushong. He was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Michael Joseph Poth, 23, was named as the suspect.
Police did not release other details.
A Marine official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the victim was based at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, and that the alleged attacker is stationed at the Marine Barracks.
The Marine Barracks, located in southeast Washington D.C., is the residence of Marines stationed there who serve as guards at the White House and other locations. The commandant of the Marine Corps also lives on its grounds.
