FBI agents raided the offices of California state Sen. Ron Calderon and the Latino legislative caucus on Tuesday. It was not immediately clear why.
"This afternoon, agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation served search warrants in the State Capitol at the office of Sen. Ron Calderon and in the Legislative Office Building at the Latino Legislative Caucus office," Tony Beard, chief sergeant at arms for the California Senate, said in a statement.
"Those warrants are sealed by order of the federal court; therefore we have no further information. The Senate has and will continue to fully cooperate with the agents in this matter."
Calderon, a Democrat, represents the city of Montebello in Los Angeles County.
His spokesman, Rocky Rushing, declined to comment.
But his attorney, Mark Geragos -- a high-profile lawyer who has represented Michael Jackson, among other celebrities -- said the raid is "an example of how out-of-control this Department of Justice is."
"They leak the search warrant but won't reveal information about the investigation. It's sinful how the FBI just shows up," he said. "Senator Calderon is a victim of this agency that has no moral compass."
The searches are not in response to anything recent and have nothing to do with public safety, said Lauren Horwood, a spokeswoman with the U.S. Attorney's Office in Sacramento.
According to FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller, no arrests are planned. She declined to identify the target and nature of the investigation.
