Egyptian security forces have arrested a Muslim Brotherhood spokesman as they continue to round up high-profile members of the organization.
Gehad El-Haddad, a frequent guest on Western media, was arrested Tuesday afternoon at an apartment in a Cairo suburb, Egypt's state-run newspaper Al-Ahram reported. He was accused of inciting violence and murder.
El-Haddad was active on social media, notifying supporters of rallies.
Egypt has been in turmoil since the military ousted President Mohamed Morsy in July. The military and Morsy opponents have battled Muslim Brotherhood members. Morsy led the political arm of the group.
In August, hundreds of people -- citizens as well as members of security forces -- were killed. Many of the deaths occurred when the military used force to clear two pro-Morsy sit-in sites in Cairo.
Violence raged after pro-Morsy supporters staged demonstrations a few days later.
