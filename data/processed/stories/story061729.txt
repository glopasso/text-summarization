(EW.com) -- Guess who's coming for Thanksgiving dinner?
Sarah Silverman and Jeff Goldblum have booked seats at the table for FX's "The League."
They'll join a Thanksgiving episode of the comedy series, with Silverman playing Andre's (Paul Scheer) sister and Jeff Goldblum as Ruxin's (Nick Kroll) father.
"Sarah and Jeff are funny and fearless enough to play Andre's sister and Ruxin's father," said League co-creators Jeff Schaffer and Jackie Marcus Schaffer. "And they didn't flinch when we told them all of the crazy things they'd be doing with our cast. Fools!"
Silverman was seen earlier this year in a guest star role on CBS' "The Good Wife." Since wrapping up "Law & Order: Criminal Intent," Goldblum has been on Adult Swim's "NTSF:SD:SUV."
