Formula One legend Jackie Stewart is recovering in hospital after falling ill whilst flying back from attending the Geneva Motor Show.
The 71-year-old Scot-- who won the world drivers' title in 1969, 1971 and 1973 -- was given medical assistance by cabin crew after passing out on the flight, before being taken by ambulance to Hillingdon Hospital in west London.
Stewart's son Paul told the BBC: "I've just spoken to him in hospital. He seemed absolutely fine but obviously something happened and we need to establish what.
"I should think he'll just be checked over and hopefully it will be nothing more sinister than that."
Confirming Stewart's arrival, a hospital spokeswoman told reporters: "Jackie Stewart was taken unwell on a flight to Heathrow. At the moment he is undergoing check-ups and his condition is stable."
Meanwhile, Stewart's private secretary, Oliver Anderson, added: "Jackie is fully conscious and having precautionary medical checks. We are expecting a full recovery from him."
As well as his three world titles, Stewart won 27 races during a Formula One career between 1965 and 1973. He also ran his own Stewart team from 1997-1999, winning one race.
