Get used to hearing the name Georgina Haig.
Up until now, the actress has been best known for her work on the sci-fi TV series "Fringe," but all that is about to change. Haig, 28, has been cast as Queen Elsa on ABC's "Once Upon a Time" series.
The show features fairy-tale characters living in a small town in Maine. Disney is the parent company of ABC, and with the mega-success of its animated film "Frozen," there was little doubt that some of those characters would eventually be incorporated into the ABC series.
It was recently announced that "Greek" actor Scott Michael Foster had been cast to play the role of Kristoff, the rugged mountain man who befriends Queen Elsa's younger sister, Anna, who'll be played by newcomer Elizabeth Lail.
But fans were still eagerly waiting to learn who would play the role of Queen Elsa of Arendelle, a part that's voiced by Idina Menzel in the animated film. The arrival of the character was revealed during the show's May finale.
Haig is an Australian actress who appeared in the critically acclaimed series "Underbelly" in her native country. On the U.S. TV series "Fringe," she played Henrietta (Etta) Bishop, the daughter of two of the show's main characters and an active member of the Resistance.
The actress is also appearing in the new CBS drama series "Reckless," which premiered in June. She recently tweeted a link to a story about the announcement of her "Once Upon a Time" casting and added one word: "excited!"
What do you think? Is Haig a good choice to play Queen Elsa?
