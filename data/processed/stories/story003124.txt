A fan of English football club Arsenal has been injured after the bus he and other supporters were traveling in was ambushed before the sides' Champions League clash in Rome, Wednesday night.
Winners: Arsenal beat Roma 7-6 on penalties after one of their fans was injured before the game.
A spokesman from the British Embassy in Rome told CNN the fan was understood to have suffered wounds to the leg -- but it was unsure if he had been stabbed or injured by broken glass.
The spokesman said the mini bus, which was not an official tour bus, became lost near the stadium and "ended up at the wrong part of the ground".
Roma fans nearby set about attacking the bus, the spokesman said.
"They smashed the windows and then one of them managed to get on the bus. This appears to be where the injury occurred," he said.
Police were quick to arrive and the bus managed to move on to safety, where the fan was treated for the wound, he said.
The visiting side went on to win the tie 7-6 on penalties after Roma won the game 1-0, leaving the two-match tie level 1-1 on aggregate.
Arsenal had distributed a booklet to its estimated 3,500 traveling fans warning that they were "at risk" if they traveled alone to the Stadio Olimpico.
The booklet warned supporters to stay clear of areas that were known gathering points of Roma's "Ultra" fans -- a group known for creating conflict with rival supporters.
Last month ten football fans were shot dead in the south of Nigeria on the way to support their team. The victims were traveling supporters of the Ocean Boys Football Club in Nigeria.
Also in February, one fan was killed and at least 40 more injured when violence broke out at football matches across Brazil.
In 2007, Manchester United fans were injured after violence in two separate incidents with Roma fans when the teams met in Rome.
In 2003 five England fans suffered gunshot wounds during a violent incident in Zurich, Switzerland, before the side played a Euro 2004 qualifier with Liechtenstein.
