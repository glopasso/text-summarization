A Colorado woman charged with conspiring to provide material support to terrorists pleaded guilty on Tuesday, according to a U.S. Justice Department statement.
Prosecutors say Jamie Paulin-Ramirez aided Colleen LaRose, a woman who called herself "Jihad Jane," in a conspiracy plot to commit murder.
LaRose is suspected of communicating with Paulin-Ramirez in August 2009, when the pair allegedly conspired to obtain military-style training in South Asia, traveling to Europe to participate and support violent jihad, according to a superseding indictment in 2010.
Paulin-Ramirez accepted LaRose's invitation, traveling to Ireland with her child with the intent to live and train with jihadists, it said.
"Keeping our community and the country safe are a top priority of this office," said U.S. Attorney Zane David Memeger, who lauded "the importance and success of international collaboration when fighting terrorism."
Last month, LaRose pleaded guilty at a federal change-of-plea hearing in Philadelphia after being indicted in 2009 on four counts, including conspiring to support terrorists and kill someone overseas.
She was allegedly part of a plot to murder Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who outraged some by depicting the prophet Mohammed with the body of a dog in 2007.
But Paulin-Ramirez's attorney Jeremy Ibrahim denies the broader conspiracy claim.
"It's clear that she is not implicated in the larger conspiracy involving Colleen LaRose, a conspiracy involving a plot to kill," he said.
Paulin-Ramirez was arrested in Ireland after LaRose. If convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison and a possible $250,000 fine at sentencing.
Five other co-conspirators were allegedly involved, but have not been named by the government.
