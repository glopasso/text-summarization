A truck pulling a flatbed trailer rolled on Interstate 10 in Mississippi, leading to a accident involving several vehicles that left four people dead and four with moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
The accident occurred around midnight Friday as the 2011 Toyota Tundra was traveling eastbound in Hancock County, west of Biloxi and 12 miles from the Louisiana state line, Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Benjamin Seibert said.
Four 18-wheeler trucks and six cars crashed after the Toyota truck lost its load on the highway as it rolled over, according to Seibert. The police spokesman said weather was not a factor.
Eastbound traffic on I-10 shut down for several hours after the accident, though everything had reopened by 7 a.m., said Johnny Poulos, another highway patrol spokesman.
