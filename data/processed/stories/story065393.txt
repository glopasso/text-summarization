(CNN)Kanye West is known for rankling people on stage.  Now it's his turn to get a virtual smackdown.
One music fan in the UK wants him out of the Glastonbury Festival so bad, he's started a petition to make it happen.
In his petition, Neil Lonsdale describes the rapper as an "egotistical, maniacal, disgrace."
He calls on organizers to replace the  "Yeezus" singer  at the Glastonbury Festival this summer. West is booked to headline the festival, which runs between June 24-28. His performance is Saturday.
"Kanye West is an insult to music fans all over the world,"  Lonsdale says in the change.org petition.  "We spend hundreds of pounds to attend glasto, and by doing so, expect a certain level of entertainment."
The petition urges West to  "pass his headline slot on to someone deserving."
Lonsdale is not the only music fan upset by his scheduled performance.  By early Friday, the petition had nearly 80,000 signatures.
West  and the festival's organizers have not responded to the petition.
The festival  is held in Somerset, England, and features various types of music.  Past performers have included the Gorillaz and Stevie Wonder.
