(CNN)Looks like another really, really, ridiculously good-looking person is joining the cast of "Zoolander 2."
Actress Penelope Cruz will appear in the upcoming sequel to the popular 2001 film, Ben Stiller announced Friday.
Stiller, who plays the title role of male model Derek Zoolander, dropped the news by sharing a photo of "Little Penny" Cruz as a child and saying he was "excited" to welcome her to the cast.
Stiller and Owen Wilson, who plays so-hot-right-now model "Hansel" made a surprise appearance at Paris Fashion Week to promote the film. It is scheduled for release in February 2016.
Stiller has been sharing photos on social media from the film's production in Italy, dropping hints to the plot. For example, it looks like Zoolander has a son in the sequel!
Stiller, a producer on the film, is also slated to produce the sequel to "Dodgeball," another fan favorite from his resume.
