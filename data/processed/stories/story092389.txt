Four people were killed after a passenger car went into a creek in the Queens section of New York, a city Fire Department spokesman said Saturday.
The accident was reported late Friday night. Police officers found the car submerged in Steinway Creek, and Fire Department divers removed four people.
Darius Fletcher, 21; Jada Monique Butts, 19; Crystal Gravely, 19; and Jaleel Furtado, 20, all of East Elmhurst, New York, were pronounced dead on arrival at area hospitals, the New York Police Department said in a news release.
The driver, a 20-year-old man, is listed in stable condition at Elmhurst General Hospital, New York Police Department spokeswoman Annette Markowski said.
Investigators said the 2009 Honda Accord hit a curb on 19th Avenue and rolled into the creek, part of the East River waterway. Fire Department spokesman Mike Parrella said there was a drop from the street to the water of at least 5 or 6 feet.
The amount of water in the creek "was enough to submerge the vehicle." Parrella said.
