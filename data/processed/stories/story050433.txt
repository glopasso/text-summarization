West Indies batsman Chris Gayle entered the record books on day two of the first Test with Sri Lanka by hitting a majestic 333.
Gayle became only the fourth player in history to register his second triple-hundred -- matching the feat of Australian legend Don Bradman, fellow West Indian Brian Lara and Virender Sehwag, of India.
The opener's huge total allowed the West Indies to compile a mammoth 580-9 declared in their first innings, with Sri Lanka reaching 54-1 in reply before play closed for the day.
Resuming overnight on 219, Gayle went on to compile the 12th highest Test total ever and the first ever triple-century by a West Indies player away from home.
Gayle took 437 balls to complete his highest ever score, surpassing the 317 he made against South Africa at Antigua in 2005, and hit 34 fours and nine sixes.
The highest ever score in Test matches is held by Lara, who hit 400 not out against England at the Antigua Recreation Ground in 2003.
Adrian Barath, Darren Bravo and Brendan Nash also hit half centuries as the West Indies declared on 580.
Andre Russell dismissed Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan for a duck but Kumar Sangakkara and Tharanga Paranavitana helped the hosts to 54-1 at the close.
Meanwhile, a double century from Brendon McCullum ensured New Zealand drew the second Test with India in Hyderabad.
The Kiwi hit 225 as the visitors reached 448-8 in their second innings before declaring. India, needing an implausible 327 for victory, made 68-0 before the close.
The series remains 0-0 with just one match to play, starting in Nagpur on Saturday.
Elsewhere, Younus Khan hit an unbeaten 131 as South Africa and Pakistan drew the first Test in Dubai.
Younus shared a partnership of 186 with skipper Misbah-ul-Haq on his first Test appearance for 16 months before the teams decided on a draw with Pakistan requiring 108 runs to win from 13 overs.
The second and final Test of the series starts in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
