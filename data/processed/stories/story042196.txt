Six suspected militants were killed in a drone strike in Miranshah Tehsil in North Waziristan, Pakistan, local tribesmen and Pakistani intelligence sources not authorized to speak to media told CNN on Wednesday.
The drone struck a house and a pickup truck in the Daraga Mandi area of Miranshah, they said.
On Thursday Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Tasnim Aslamm confirmed to reporters that a U.S. drone struck, and stressed that Pakistan condemns such action.
Wednesday's strike was the third drone attack in the area this month. Two previous attacks in June killed top Haqqani network commanders and Central Asian militants.
A reporter asked Aslam about the timing of the latest strike.
"Are you implying that these attacks have been coordinated?" Aslam answered. "If that is the case then you are wrong. There is no way we condone these attacks. We have condemned them. You know that the government of Pakistan has taken a number of steps to generate international public opinion against drone strikes."
A Pakistani government release reiterated that "Pakistan regards such strikes as a violation of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. These strikes also have a negative impact on the government's efforts to bring peace and stability in Pakistan and the region."
