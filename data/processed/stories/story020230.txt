A voluntary recall of breaded chicken wings will take a bite out of the nation's supply during the flurry of college football bowl games.
Pilgrim's Pride on Thursday recalled about 180,000 pounds of Pierce Hot & Spicy Breaded Chicken Wings and Sweet Georgia Brand Hot & Spicy Breaded Chicken Wings because they contain egg, an undeclared allergen, officials said.
The U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service said the problem was discovered by the company through a labeling review as part of its quality-assurance program. Egg is not shown among ingredients on the labels, the agency said.  Cilantro, celery recalled
The recalled products, which carry the item codes 1703 and 95122, were sold to food service distributors in 20-pound and 10-pound cases, respectively. They were produced in the company's plant in Boaz, Alabama.
There have been no reports of adverse reactions because of the consumption of the products, the company and federal officials said.
Each uncooked product bears the designation "P-413" printed adjacent to a coded date, as well as coded designations of "0001," "0007," "0029," "0044," "0056," "0058," "0063," "0075," "0098," "0109," "0119," "0135," "0188," "0215," "0230," "0244," or "0279."
The wings were produced on various dates between January 1, 2010, and October 6, 2010, and sent to 30 food service distribution centers for further distribution to restaurants, the inspection service and company said.
