Five workers for Doctors Without Borders were abducted from a house the organization was using in northern Syria, the group said Friday.
The five were abducted Thursday evening "by a group allegedly for questioning," said Guillermo Agar, a Doctors Without Borders representative. He passed along the group's statement to CNN in an e-mail from his base in Madrid.
Rebel forces and Islamic militants control much of Syria's northern territories.
"We are in contact with all the relevant stakeholders and the families of our staff members, and are doing all we can to reestablish contact with our colleagues," the statement said. He said that he does not know all the nationalities of the workers and would not release more information, citing safety concerns for the workers.
Doctors Without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, operates six hospitals and four health centers in northern Syria and has been trying to help Syrian refugees who have fled the violence that has gripped the country since the war began in April 2011.
