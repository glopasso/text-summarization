One of two teenage students stabbed at a Chicago school has died, police said.
The incident occurred Thursday morning inside the front door of the city's AMIkids Infinity School and prompted authorities to rush the teens to a nearby hospital, according to police spokesman Mike Sullivan.
"It is a tragedy for us," said school Vice President Shawna Vercher. "Our hearts are with the families involved, and we are going to make sure our priorities are with those families.
"We will offer our support to help them get through this crisis," she said, noting that the facility has a screening process to keep weapons out of the school.
The process, which includes the use of an electronic wand to screen entrants, takes place between the first and second set of school doors.
The alleged attacker, a 17-year-old boy, is suspected of stabbing his victims inside the front door but prior to going through the wand screening, authorities said.
The student who died was also a 17-year-old boy who had been previously listed in critical condition after the attack. Another 17-year-old boy was listed in serious condition, Sullivan said.
School officials say AMIkids operates 56 facilities across the nation and works with local school districts to educate students who have been expelled or suspended from schools elsewhere.
Teachers at AMIkids schools are trained in crisis control, officials said.
