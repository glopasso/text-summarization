Europe's women hold a slender advantage over the U.S. team at the midway point of The 2013 Solheim Cup at the Colorado Golf Club on Saturday.
The European team started the day 5-3 ahead after winning the opening day foursomes 3-1 and sharing the points in the afternoon four-balls.
But the U.S. fought back in Saturday morning's foursomes to leave the match finely poised at 6.5 points to 5.5.
It had looked as if the match was slipping away from the home side early on Saturday as Swedish pair Anna Nordqvist and Caroline Hedwall's recorded a sensational 2&1 win over Morgan Pressel and Jessica Korda in the opening match.
Europe left it late to strike, but when they did it was decisive. Hedwell's birdie at the 16th put Europe one up before Nordqvist closed out the match in incredible style, breaking American hearts with a hole-in-one at the 180-yard par three 17th.
"It's an unbelievable feeling. They played tough but we holed the putts and it is amazing to finish that way. It was a perfectly struck seven iron," Nordqvist said, www.ladieseuropeantour.com reported.
The hammer blow left the U.S. trailing 6-3, but Stacy Lewis and Paula Creamer immediately restored some hope with a hard fought one-hole victory over Azahara Munoz and Karine Icher.
Another half point was gained soon after when the match between Brittany Lincicome and Lizette Salas and Catriona Matthew and Caroline Masson finished all-square.
All eyes turned to the final match where Michelle Wie and Brittany Lang claimed a vital 2&1 win over European pairing Suzann Pettersen and Beatriz Recari.
Midway through the afternoon fourballs, Europe hold the advantage in three matches with the U.S. up in one.
