The Richard Nixon Presidential Library will allow access Tuesday to about 154 hours of Nixon White House tape recordings and 30,000 pages of documents that were formerly classified.
President Nixon announces the U.S. incursion into Cambodia during the Vietnam War in April 1970.
Among the tapes and documents are conversations about the Vietnam War, Nixon's second inauguration, the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision in 1973 and the first Watergate trial, according to a library statement.
Tuesday's release is the 13th opening of Nixon White House tapes since 1980, the statement said.
The new Nixon tapes and documents will be available on the Internet and in the Richard Nixon libraries in College Park, Maryland, and Yorba Linda, California.
Nixon resigned August 9, 1974, over the Watergate scandal -- the first president to resign from office.
President Ford pardoned Nixon the following month, saying it was necessary for the nation to heal after Watergate.
