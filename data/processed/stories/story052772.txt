Authorities say a Maryland woman suffocated her two kids, 1 and 3 years old, and then told a relative what she'd done.
Prince George's County police accused 24-year-old Sonya Katarina Spoon of suffocating 1-year-old Ayden Spoon and 3-year-old Kayla Thompson over the weekend.
The children died at a hospital, authorities say.
Police say they found plastic bags near both of the kids.
Spoon gave police a detailed statement on how the children died, according to police.
She is charged with two counts of first-degree murder and is being held without bail pending a court appearance, according to authorities.
Spoon has been dealing with a stressful custody issue and has been "under extreme psychological and mental distress," said her mother, Paivi Spoon.
