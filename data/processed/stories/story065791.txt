(RollingStone.com) -- Kid Rock stopped by the Howard Stern Show Wednesday and shared some lively stories about chatting with Mitt Romney and hosting a dinner party with Eminem, CBS Detroit reports.
Rock revealed that when Romney contacted him for his support during his presidential campaign, he demanded answers first. Romney's team agreed, and the two sat down at the rocker's house with a campaign aide, two Secret Service members and a preapproved list of questions.
Rock said he wanted to ensure that Romney was not "just a rich guy who wanted to become president to out-do [his] dad," but someone of greater substance. "I know what it's like to want to be better than your father," Rock told Howard Stern. "Of course, I'm getting these 'I really want to help America [answers]' and I said, 'Cut the s**t, this is my living room; this isn't going to leave here.'" Rock's main concern was his hometown, and once he had a commitment towards improving Detroit from Romney, he was all in.
Kid Rock also shared the story of hosting a dinner party with fellow Detroit native Eminem. "He came by the house, we had dinner, I cooked, just having a sophisticated kind of dinner," said Rock. He added of the rapper, "He's a great family guy."
Though he's a vocal conservative, Rock also said that he's not into right-wing social politics. "I'm into less government," he said, adding, "If gay people want to get married, I don't give a f**k." For Rock, disagreement in beliefs is fine, but failing to vote isn't. "It's OK to stand for something... I've got friends who didn't vote. I want to smack them upside the head," he said.
Kid Rock also hinted today on his Facebook page about an upcoming tour to support his forthcoming album Rebel Soul, out November 19th. "Can't wait to hit the road in a few months and celebrate with everyone," he wrote.
