Charlie Sheen's FX comedy "Anger Management" has lost a leading lady.
CNN has confirmed that actress Selma Blair has parted ways with the series, which stars Sheen as a therapist named Charlie with complicated problems of his own. Blair portrayed Kate, his fellow therapist and "best friend with benefits."
Recent reports have hinted at tension between Blair and Sheen, with TMZ suggesting that Sheen wanted the actress off the show because of alleged negative comments about his work ethic. On Tuesday, studio Lionsgate only acknowledged Blair's departure.
"We are confirming that Selma Blair will not be returning to 'Anger Management' and we wish her the very best," a statement said.
On Twitter, Blair has assured fans that she's doing fine.
"Life is good," she tweeted Tuesday ahead of Lionsgate's statement, following it up the next morning with a note of gratitude to her fans. "I thank you for support and love."
