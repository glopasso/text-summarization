Firefighters in Detroit, Michigan, grappled with 85 fires in a four-hour period Tuesday night, officials said.
"A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires," said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman.
There were no reports of deaths or injuries, she said.
"We had winds from 30-50 mph and have a number of downed power wires," said Detroit Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. "We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires which makes more fires with the wind being so strong."
Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. the fire department responded to 140 calls for wires down before the evening outbreak.
Detroit firefighters received assistance from fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods.
"It's a matter of public safety," Dumas said. "We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."
There also was at least one report of suspected arson associated with the fires, Mack said. A man in the city's northeast section is being questioned.
