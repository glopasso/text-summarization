(CNN)  -- Lazio are the new leaders in Serie A after beating Brescia 1-0 on Sunday with champions Inter Milan held to a goalless draw at home to Juventus in the late match.
Stefano Mauri scored the only goal of the game just before halftime to give the side from the capital a vital three points and an unlikely top spot for a club hit by a financial crisis.
They have 13 points from six games, two clear of Inter, Napoli and AC Milan.
Napoli showed their title credentials by downing Lazio's arch-rivals AS Roma 2-0 earlier Sunday.
Marek Hamsik and a Juan own goal delighted the home fans in the San Paolo stadium in Naples and left Roma in the bottom three.
They had to wait until 72 minutes for the breakthrough as Hamsik charged forward to drill home a shot.
Napoli wrapped up victory when Hugo Campagnaro's cross from the right caused chaos and eventually went in off Juan.
Inter knew they had to beat Juve to go top of the table but it did not look likely  after a dull first half with few chances, the best falling to Esteban Cambiasso and Diego Milito.
Home keeper Julio Cesar had to make important saves as the visitors were more ambitious after the break, but Inter might have stolen it as Milito controlled Cambiasso through ball but sent his shot wide from close range.
