Severe weather brought damaging winds across much of eastern North Carolina, officials said Friday evening.
"It's dark, rainy and dangerous, and the roads are flooded," Julia Jarema, a North Carolina Division of Emergency Management spokeswoman, told CNN.
Numerous tornado warnings and watches were in effect for Beaufort, Edgecombe, Greene, Halifax, Martin, Pitt and Wayne counties over the course of Friday afternoon and evening, the National Weather Service warned.
There were unconfirmed reports of tornadoes.
"There are no reports of any injuries in any of the counties," said Jarema.
Tornadoes, hail and high winds may break out in the central and southern Plains this weekend before moving eastward into the Mississippi River Valley and Southeast early next week.
There's a slight risk of this severe weather Saturday in south Nebraska, central and east Kansas, west Texas and most of Oklahoma, CNN meteorologists reported.
On Sunday, there's a moderate chance of that weather in northeast Texas, southwest Arkansas and southeast Oklahoma.
Little Rock, Arkansas, for example, has a 70% chance of severe thunderstorms Sunday night, with 1 to 2 inches of rain possible, according to the National Weather Service.
On Monday, the weather system will move east into the lower Mississippi and Tennessee River valleys, CNN meteorologists reported.
The chance of rain is 80% Sunday night in St. Louis, the weather service said. Nashville will see a 70% to 80% chance of rain Sunday night to Monday night, with the possibility of 25-mph winds.
Folks in Memphis, Tennessee, should keep their umbrellas handy: The chance of rain is 60% to 70% Sunday through Tuesday.
On Tuesday, the storms are expected to spread across the Southeast and affect Atlanta, New Orleans, Birmingham, Alabama, and Louisville, Kentucky.
The weather service foresees a 60% to 70% chance of rain in Birmingham and Atlanta, but no high winds are predicted.
