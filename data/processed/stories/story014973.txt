In Memphis there's only one person called "the king:" the late Elvis Presley.
But this weekend, the city had  two princes -- William and Harry.
The grandsons of the Queen of England visited Memphis to see their friend, Guy Pelly, tie the knot with native Memphian Elizabeth "Lizzy" Wilson, CNN affiliate WREG reported.
She's the granddaughter of the man who founded the Holiday Inn chain. Her new husband is a London nightclub owner.
On Saturday, royal fans lined the road leading to the the Memphis Hunt and Polo Club, where the wedding was held, to catch a glimpse of the princes.
"I'm a big Prince Harry fan!" Darla Chapman told WREG. "I'm single! I heard he's single!"
Alas, the princes came in through a different entrance, so Chapman and the others never got a chance to see them.
But the young princes got out a good bit in Memphis.
On Thursday, they dined at the Rendezvous, one of the city's best-known barbecue restaurants.  Dressed casually in jeans, they dashed inside as security held back the commoners pressing for a look.
On Friday they paid a visit to Presley's home, Graceland, the Memphis version of Buckingham Palace.
"It was pretty awesome," local Nicholas Pegues said of the visit. "A once in a lifetime event!"
