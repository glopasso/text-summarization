(CNN)It's a girls' universe.
On Wednesday, DC Entertainment, Warner Bros. and Mattel announced a partnership to launch DC Super Hero Girls, featuring familiar superheroes and supervillains as "relatable teens," according to a press release.
(Like CNN, DC and Warner Bros. are units of Time Warner.)
The characters involved include Wonder Woman, Supergirl, Batgirl, Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy, among others.
Though initial reaction on social media appeared favorable -- "My daughter will be a big fan I think," wrote NerdGallagher -- praise wasn't universal.
"Just let us into the old universes!" tweeted Kathleen E. Kennedy.
And Jenna Busch, writing for Legion of Leia, was concerned the initiative was another way of keeping girls separate.
"Targeting them as 'for girls only' is just another way to be exclusive," she wrote. "Look, I appreciate the effort, but drawing yet another line between men and women is not the way to go. So, where are you going to put these products in Target? On the pink side of the toy section or the blue side?"
DC Super Hero Girls is aimed at girls ages 6-12 and will include online content, toys, books and TV specials.
Mattel is the toy licensee and Random House Books for Young Readers will publish books based on the franchise. The first elements will roll out in the fall.
