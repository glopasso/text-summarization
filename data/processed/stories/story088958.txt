Singer-songwriter Paul Simon said Monday that he and wife Edie Brickell "had an argument" before they were arrested Saturday.
Brickell, in a statement sent to CNN by her lawyer, said she started it.
"I got my feelings hurt and I picked a fight with my husband," Brickell said.Â  "The police called it disorderly.Â  Thank God it's orderly now"
Simon and Brickell were arrested on disorderly conduct charges by police investigating a family dispute at their New Canaan, Connecticut, home Saturday night, according to police. "Investigating officers gathered information and found probable cause to arrest" Simon, 72, and Brickell, 47, a police statement said.
The couple was released from custody Sunday morning.
They held hands when appearing before a judge in the Norwalk Superior Court Monday.
"Edie and I are fine," Simon said. "We're going to see our son's baseball game this afternoon."
The judge declined to issue a protective order that would have kept Simon and Brickell apart. Their case was continued until May 16.
Simon and Brickell live in New Canaan, an affluent Connecticut community about an hour's train ride from Manhattan. The town is home to a long list of rich and famous.
Simon is half of the legendary duo of Simon and Garfunkel that, starting in the 1960s, had hits including "Bridge Over Troubled Water," "Mrs. Robinson," "The Sound of Silence" and "Scarborough Fair." His solo career has spanned four decades and produced hits including, "Still Crazy After All These Years," "Graceland" and "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover."
Brickell has one chart hit, titled "What I Am," with her 1980s rock group Edie Brickell & New Bohemians. She has also recorded with Simon during their 22 years of marriage.
