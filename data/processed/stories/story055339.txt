"American Idol" Season 14 will look a lot like last season -- at least in terms of the judges and the host.
Fox has announced that the entire Season 13 crew will return. That means host Ryan Seacrest and judges Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick Jr. will all be back witnessing some of the best, and worst, of America's singers.
"I am thrilled our consummate host, Mr. Ryan Seacrest, is returning for Season 14, together with Jennifer, Harry and Keith," "Idol" creator and executive producer Simon Fuller said. "Their interaction, warmth and experience made them an absolute joy to watch. I can't wait to see their evolution together continue next season."
The reality singing competition has had some upheaval at the judges table over the past few years as it's struggled with faltering ratings and the lack of any competitors who have reached the heights in the music industry of former winners Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood.
Lopez initially joined the show in Season 10, but left following Season 11. Season 12 was rife with rumors of a feud between then judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj. Urban joined the show that season, replacing rocker Steven Tyler.
Ryan Seacrest is the only member that has been with "Idol" since it premiered in 2002.
