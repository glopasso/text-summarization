Kate Hudson's ex, Black Crowes rocker Chris Robinson, is going to be a dad again, a representative for the band confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
Chris Robinson and girlfriend Allison Bridges will be having a child in early 2010.
Robinson and girlfriend Allison Bridges, who have been dating for two years, are expecting their first child in early 2010, the statement said.
The baby will be the 42-year-old frontman's second child --­ he and Hudson have a 5 1/2-year-old son, Ryder Russell, together.
Hudson and Robinson were married for six years and their divorce was finalized in October 2006. They were granted joint custody of their son.
Robinson and his brother Rich formed the band that would eventually become the Black Crowes in the 1980s.
The Crowes' new album, "Before the Frost . . . Until the Freeze," is in stores now.
