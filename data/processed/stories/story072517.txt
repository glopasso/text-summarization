Britain's Prince Charles has produced a "personal tribute" to his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, that will air Friday to kick off celebrations of her 60th anniversary on the throne, his office announced Thursday.
The tribute draws on home movies and photographs from the royal family's personal collection, with Charles providing his own recollections, Clarence House -- Charles' official residence -- reported. The film is scheduled to air on the BBC on Friday evening, ahead of Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee events.
"The Diamond Jubilee gives us the chance to celebrate with pride all that the Queen means to us -- whether as a nation or as one of her children," Charles says in the documentary.
The progam will feature behind-the-scenes footage of Elizabeth's formal coronation in 1953; of Charles and his sister, Princess Anne, playing on the beach as children; and royal life at Windsor and Balmoral dating back to the 1940s.
"Although much of the film is rooted in childhood memories, the Prince is keen to take this opportunity to pay tribute to his mother throughout her reign, from the moment she became Queen on safari in Kenya through to last year's historic visit to Ireland," a statement from Clarence House announced.
Only one other British monarch -- Queen Victoria, who reigned from from 1837 to 1901 -- has served as head of state as long.
