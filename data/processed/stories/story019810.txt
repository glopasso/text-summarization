The sea of online travel reviews is daunting. So many, many choices, so many (wildly divergent) opinions.
Review giant TripAdvisor has weeded through millions of traveler reviews to identify its users' favorite hotels.
On Wednesday, the site announced its 2014 Travelers' Choice Awards. More than 7,000 properties received awards, which were divided into categories including top hotels, bargains, B&Bs and inns, family, luxury, romance and small hotels.
The country with the most award winners? Italy, with 152 hotels. TripAdvisor uses an algorithm that measures the quality and quantity of the ratings from traveler reviews and opinions to identify the Travelers' Choice properties.
Check out the gallery above for the top 10 winners worldwide in the "Top Hotels" category.  The average nightly rate among the category's award-winners is $366.
