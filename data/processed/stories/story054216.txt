(CNN)As a youngster, Rohana Rozhan had a nickname that summed her up perfectly: "Rohana the Piranha."
Even as a little girl growing up in Malaysia, the future CEO of a $4.6 billion media company was small but deadly.
"I was born independent, fiercely so," 51-year-old Rozhan told CNN's Kristie Lu-Stout.
"I always had a chip on my shoulder that I had to prove to everyone that I'm independent."
Today she's proved it -- and then some.
Rozhan heads Astro Malaysia, one of the biggest media and entertainment firms in the region. She's in charge of producing over 9,000 hours of original content a year -- ranging from radio broadcasts to hits on the silver screen.
"We have 52% women working at Astro, but one of the things we are very very passionate about, is that each woman has to be the best person for the job."
"If you grow up a good Muslim, Malay girl, one of the things you have to learn is you can be the smartest kid on the block, but you have to be respectful."
"You have to want it, but you can't just want it without the work. You have to want it, yet understand, that it's not going to be easy."
