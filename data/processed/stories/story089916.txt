One of the most popular singers of the 1950s, Eddie Fisher, has died. He was 82.
Fisher died of complications from hip surgery Wednesday, his family said.
"Late last evening the world lost a true America icon. Eddie Fisher, 82, one of the greatest voices of the century passed away in Berkeley, CA due to complications and a decline in health from a recent hip surgery," his family members said in a statement. "He was loved and will be missed by his four children: Carrie, Todd, Joely, and Tricia Leigh as well as his six grandchildren. He was an extraordinary talent."
Eddie Fisher: His life and times
Although Fisher sold millions of records and had his own television show, his biggest claim to fame may be his high-profile marriages to Hollywood starlets Debbie Reynolds, Elizabeth Taylor and Connie Stevens -- all of which ended in divorce.

He had two more marriages after that.
Fisher also co-starred in the films "Bundle of Joy" and "Butterfield 8". Among his four children, Carrie Fisher and Joely Fisher were actresses.
Fisher has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one for recording and the other for TV.
Carrie Fisher said recently on the micro-blogging website Twitter that her father had just undergone hip surgery.
