AMC isn't settling for just one "Walking Dead." The network has ordered a pilot for a companion series, according to Entertainment Weekly.
The series will be set in a different location than "The Walking Dead" and will feature a different cast, but it will be grounded in the same zombie-infested world. Better still, the pilot will have the same creative team behind it as "TWD," including executive producers Robert Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd and David Alpert.
Kirkman, who crafted the pilot script with "Sons of Anarchy's" Dave Erickson,  told EW that there are still "many corners of 'The Walking Dead' universe that remain unseen in the shadows," and he is excited to shed some light on them with a different project.
Though details about the companion series are scarce, AMC President Charlie Collier assured fans that everyone is trying to keep the bar high.
"Obviously, we all take our stewardship of the original franchise incredibly seriously," he told EW, "and we ... are all proceeding with extreme care in order to ensure that we are offering fans something truly compelling, engaging and distinct."
If they pull it off, AMC is in for another ratings juggernaut. "The Walking Dead" consistently performs for the network, reaching a peak of 16.1 million viewers with its season four premiere in October 2013. It closed out that season in March with 15.7 million.
"The Walking Dead" season five is expected to premiere in October. If you need to catch up, season four arrives on Netflix streaming September 28.
