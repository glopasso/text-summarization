More than Justin Timberlake, Kanye West, Lady Gaga or Lorde, it was Miley Cyrus who owned 2013.
At least, according to MTV.
After stealing the spotlight at not one but two MTV awards shows, starring in an MTV documentary and taking over the network on her 21st birthday, MTV has crowned Cyrus as its best artist of the year.
It's not like the pop star hasn't worked for it. (Or twerked for it -- we had to!) Her October release, "Bangerz," bowed at No.1 and features two other chart-topping tracks, "We Can't Stop" and "Wrecking Ball." Both singles were accompanied by music videos that became cultural touchstones and almost broke the Internet. (According to Vevo.com, Cyrus' "Wrecking Ball" is its most-viewed video of 2013, followed by the clip for "We Can't Stop.")
The former Disney star also nailed her appearance on "Saturday Night Live" in the fall, when she both hosted and performed. Barbara Walters considers Cyrus one of the most fascinating people of the year, and she somehow managed to end up on Time magazine's best- and worst-dressed lists of 2013.
Given that, it's not too surprising that MTV's news and music teams -- having noticed that Cyrus' MTV artist page is the most-visited of the year, with her VMAs performance being the most-watched video -- have given her another No. 1.
Cyrus is the third star to take the title, following Katy Perry and One Direction.
Neither of those music acts should feel too badly about losing to Cyrus -- they're both still on MTV's list of the top 10 best artists of 2013:
1. Miley Cyrus
2. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis
3. Justin Timberlake
4. Kanye West
5. One Direction
6. Katy Perry
7. Drake
8. Bruno Mars
9. Lorde
10. Lady Gaga
