(CNN)Gunmen fired on police in a suburb of the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the prosecutor's office said.
Shots were directed at a police car, and police returned fire, according to prosecutors. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
A SWAT team was sent to the scene.
The gunfire erupted in Castellane, a suburb in northern Marseille that's known for its drug-related activity.
France has been under a heightened state of alert since last month's terror attacks in Paris that killed 17 people.
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls is scheduled to be in Marseille later Monday.
