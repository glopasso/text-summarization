A vessel carrying about 100,000 gallons of petroleum products struck a submerged object and was sinking in the Mississippi River on Monday night.
Officials closed a section of the river near LeClaire, Iowa, to deal with the oil that was discharging from the towboat, the Coast Guard said.
Nine crew members were aboard the 144-foot Stephen L. Colby when the accident occurred. All were able to make it to safety.
The cause is under investigation.
