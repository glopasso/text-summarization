"Partners," which was released on September 16, is Streisand's 10th No. 1. But perhaps more impressively, the album's strong debut also makes Streisand the first artist to have a No. 1 album in each of the past six decades.
Her first No. 1 album, "People," arrived 50 years ago in October 1964.

On "Partners," Streisand performs duets of classic tracks with some of the biggest male artists. There's "New York State of Mind" with Billy Joel and "The Way We Were" with Lionel Richie. She even sings a virtual duet with Elvis Presley on "Love Me Tender."
With 196,000 copies of "Partners" sold, Streisand can also boast having the largest sales week for a female artist so far this year.
