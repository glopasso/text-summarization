A Kansas City-area man proposed to his girlfriend during a Royals baseball game this week, after she gave him one of her kidneys earlier this year, according to CNN affiliate KSHB.
Taesha Benson donated a kidney to Travis Spire-Sweet just before Valentine's Day. Spire-Sweet was born with only 25% of a functioning kidney, and Benson was a perfect match, the station reported.
The chances of unrelated people being this close of a match for kidney donation is about 1 in 30,000, according to the University of Kansas Hospital, where the surgery was performed.
Every 10 minutes, someone is added to the waiting list for a donated organ, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
Some receive the organ they need. But every year, thousands of people die waiting for a donor organ they never receive -- about 18 per day.
