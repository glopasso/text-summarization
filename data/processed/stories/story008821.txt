Crew members piloting a Qantas passenger flight from Thailand to London returned to Bangkok shortly after takeoff early Friday after detecting vibrations and high temperature in one of the aircraft's engines, according to a statement released by the airline.
Qantas called the crew's decision "a precaution, in line with procedure."
"The aircraft can fly safely on three engines and landed normally in Bangkok," the Qantas statement read.
The airline stated that the 307 passengers on board the Boeing 747 aircraft would be "accommodated on alternative onward services."
The incident occurred three days after an engine on a Cathay Pacific flight caught fire, forcing an emergency landing in Singapore. The engine was manufactured by Rolls Royce.
Last November, the pilots of a Qantas A380 headed to Sydney, Australia, returned the aircraft to Singapore after one of its engines caught fire. A report released the following month by the Australian Transport Safety Board identified a potential manufacturing defect in the engine, also manufactured by Rolls Royce.
The defect, according to the board report, was in the oil pipes, which can become cracked, allowing oil to leak.
