Tony Fernandes is the CEO of Air Asia, Asia's leading low fare, no frills airline, flying to destinations across the region.
After graduating from the London School of Economics in 1987, he worked as an accountant for Richard Branson's Virgin Records from 1987 to 1989.
The amateur guitarist went on to become vice-president for Southeast Asia for Warner Music Group from 1992-2001.
In a dramatic change of direction, Fernandes left the music industry to buy Air Asia, a bankrupt carrier -- the purchase cost him a token fee of 26 cents.
Since taking over Air Asia he has become known as the Richard Branson of Asian air travel. E-mail to a friend
