Travelers planning to attend the 2014 World Cup in Brazil better get cracking on their accommodation bookings.
Organizers from FIFA and tournament sponsors have already started making mass hotel bookings for next summer, and private home owners in Brazil have responded, renting out apartments for the World Cup period, according to the Rio Times.
Although projected numbers vary, approximately 600,000 foreign visitors and 3 million domestic tourists are expected to travel to or within Brazil for the World Cup.
A large percentage of those travelers are expected to be looking for alternative accommodations, such as private homes, bed and breakfasts and hostels.
According to the Brazilian daily, some four-room penthouses in Ipanema are asking $150,000 for one month's rental.
A studio apartment in Copacabana is being rented out at $7,000 for four weeks, while a villa is using the deposit from a booking already made for next summer to renovate the house for more such rentals.
Hotel infrastructure for Brazil's most anticipated mega-event has been a concern, but the local hotel industry says it's confident it will be ready to face the onslaught of tourists.
The city also plans to berth six cruise ships as tourist accommodation.
Marcelo Rocha e Silva Zorovich, a visiting researcher at the University of Miami, told the Los Angeles Times last month that providing enough hotel rooms for the event was a big concern.
"We'll make it to the Cup but the infrastructure won't be ready," Zorovich said.
According to the Times, Rio is planning to construct around 22,000 new rooms, but experts are skeptical that number will be reached in time.
