Greg Norman says he is lucky to still have his left hand after a chainsaw accident.
The famed Australian golfer, who won two majors and 20 U.S. PGA Tour titles, posted a photo late Saturday on his Instagram account showing him lying in a hospital bed.
"Working with a chainsaw ALWAYS be respectful of the unexpected," he wrote in the caption. "I was one lucky man today. Damaged, but not down & out. Still have left hand."
Later he posted another photo with his left forearm in a foam device that helps keep the arm in place.
"Thank u all for your concern & good wishes. All well the morning after the accident. Here I am at the scene of the crime ... w/my new fashion statement!" wrote Norman, who lives in Jupiter Island, Florida.
His daughter told CNN that he is recovering "nicely."
"He will have a hundred percent recovery in a few weeks," Morgan-leigh Norman said.
Her father had minor surgery to repair slight nerve damage, she said. The accident happened at his Florida home, she said. He went to surgery Saturday afternoon and was home that night.
Last weekend, Norman, known as the "Great White Shark," had posted a picture of himself holding a chainsaw next to a tree with several branches already severed.
"Time to trim the sea grapes today," the caption on that photo said. "Never ask someone to do something that you can do yourself. Love to work!"
As news of his injury spread Sunday, people flocked to his Instagram and Twitter feeds to express concern and wish him a speedy recovery.
Norman, 59, was one of the dominant golfers in the 1980s and 1990s, spending a total of 331 weeks at the top of the world rankings and winning two British Open Championships. He now has his own clothing brand, real estate business and golf course design company.
