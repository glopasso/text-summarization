At least six people have been killed in avalanches recently in the West, as the risk of snow slides remains high.
Two people were killed in each of three states: Oregon, Utah and Colorado.
In Oregon, two cross-country skiers were killed Tuesday in an avalanche about 10 miles northwest of Halfway, according to the Baker County Sheriff's Office.
Eight people were in their party when the snow slide hit. Besides those killed, two people were seriously injured and four escaped unharmed. The skiers were from the Seattle area and on a guided, multiday trip.
In Utah, a snowmobiler and a snowshoer were killed in separate incidents over the weekend, the Utah Avalanche Center said.
And in Colorado, two people were buried by large avalanches, again in separate events. One was caught by a snow slide near Kebler Pass; the other south of the Keystone Ski Area, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.
The center has issued an advisory warning that avalanche conditions in the backcountry remain dangerous.
"Cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making are essential. Travel in or below avalanche terrain is not recommended," it said. "Veteran snow professionals are reporting triggered avalanches in well-documented avalanche paths that are breaking mature timber and behaving in surprising ways."
A 28-year-old man was buried by a triggered avalanche in northern Utah on Tuesday, the state's Avalanche Center said. But his sledding companions managed to quickly dig him out, and he recovered on the scene.
