Depressed and tired of trying diet after diet, Andy Sorrells began a faith-based weight loss program.
Andy Sorrells lost 280 pounds and went from wearing a size 64 to wearing a size 36.
He says he started without a specific goal weight and reduced his portion sizes to lose 280 pounds.  Name: Andy Sorrells Age: 29 Hometown: Franklin, Tennessee Occupation: Loan Processor Height: 6 feet 3 inches Heaviest weight: 500 pounds Current weight: 220 pounds Pounds lost: 280 pounds  Defining moment My wife, Maggie, had started the Weigh Down Workshop program. We were newlyweds and continued to gain weight. We had tried other diets but this one worked for us.  How did you finally lose the weight? Diet: Weigh Down Workshop, a spiritually based weight loss regimen. I just started without a real goal of losing a specific amount of weight and reduced my portion sizes. I spent so much of my life thinking about it and planning for it. Finally, I stopped focusing on food, stopped counting calories and eating low-fat foods. You just have to eat what your body craves and reduce portion sizes.
Exercise: I didn't really exercise. I walked occasionally but I never followed a specific fitness regimen.  How long did it take you to lose weight? Just about 17 months from January 2003 to May 2004. My wife had tried the Weigh Down Workshop and had success with it. I was trying diet foods and fat-free foods. But I knew there had to be a way someone could eat normal food and still lose weight.
How has this changed your life? When I was born I was close to 11 pounds and all of my life I've dealt with weight issues. People always teased me about being overweight. Once I started this program, I realized that I had to stop being angry at the world and I needed to look internally.
Once I started this program, it changed my outlook on my entire life. I realized that being happy is a choice. I can either be filled with hate and despair or I can be happy and help others.
