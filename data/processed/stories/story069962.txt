Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in an interview on "NBC's Today" set to air Thursday that he lives a "simple" life and proudly wears the same thing every day.
Zuckerberg — who has appeared on GQ and Esquire's worst-dressed list in 2011 — confessed in an interview taped last week with "Today" host Matt Lauer that he owns "maybe about 20″ identical gray t-shirts.
"I mean, I wear the same thing every day, right? I mean, it's literally, if you could see my closet at home..." Zuckerberg said. "My wife has a bunch of stuff. Although she has her drawer — primarily scrubs for the hospital — I get one drawer. And my drawer is about 20 of these gray t-shirts."
He said he has one drawer, "like men everywhere."
Do you dress the same every day too?
Other notables known to wear the same thing every day? Steve Jobs and Albert Einstein.

Although Zuckerberg gave his first post-IPO interview at a tech conference this month, this will be his first interview with the mainstream press since Facebook went public in May. According to NBC, the interview also includes Zuckerberg opening up about plans for the social network, employee morale and his recent wedding.
He says he feels "a lot of responsibility" for his employees, who feel comfortable calling him by his first name: "No one calls me 'Mr. Zuckerberg.' I mean, it's — we do a lot to create this open culture."

Although Apple CEO Tim Cook sent Zuckerberg a free iPhone 5 after the launch, the Facebook executive said he uses many different devices.
"iPhone is a great platform," he told Lauer. "There are more people who use Facebook on Android because Android is just ... More people use it, at this point. So it's actually a pretty diverse ecosystem. And we spend our time building for all these different things."
