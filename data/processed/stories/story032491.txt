(Rolling Stone)  -- It's nice when dreams come true, and even better when the person has dreamed big.
Superproducer Danger Mouse has for years been talking privately about a project inspired by 1960s to 1970s Italian film scores, and he didn't cut corners:
He and co-composer Daniele Luppi booked a studio in Rome co-founded by Ennio Morricone, and reconvened the soundtrack guru's key musicians.
"Rome" opens on the tumbleweedy voice of 76-year-old Edda Dell'Orso, who sang the haunting operatic vowels around Clint Eastwood in 1966's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."
It's a 15-track score to a film that exists only in your head.

Co-stars Jack White and Norah Jones get three songs each. White is a ghostly high-plains drifter on "The Rose With the Broken Neck" and a self-loathing mercenary on "Two Against One."
Jones plays even more against type, conjuring a sultry Sicilian soul diva over Isaac Hayes-style strings on "Season's Trees," and awesomely declaring, "I'm the disease," on "Black."

More vocal tracks would be nice, but "Rome" is as much about sublime instrumentals -- made of celesta, harpsichord, Hammond organ, strings, nasty funk guitar and those weird-ass choirs -- as lead singers, just as Sergio Leone's great Westerns were as much about fantastic landscapes as acting.
Just switch your cell to "vibrate" and enjoy the show.
