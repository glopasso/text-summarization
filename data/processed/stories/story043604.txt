A late-night scuffle after the Denver Broncos-San Diego Chargers game, which left at least three people with stab wounds, appears to be over a parking space rather than a football rivalry, police said Friday.
Police took three people into custody, and two have been released pending further investigation, Denver Police Sgt. Steve Warneke said Friday.
Justin Manzanares, 29, is being held for investigation of three counts of aggravated assault.
A fourth person also may have been injured in the Thursday incident in the parking lot next to Sports Authority Field at Mile High, but authorities have yet to find that victim, Warneke said. That person left without seeking treatment, according to authorities.
The three victims are now in stable condition after suffering non-life-threatening injuries, he said.
"It doesn't appear that this was related to the outcome of the game. It doesn't appear that this was Broncos versus Chargers. It appears this stemmed from a traffic altercation in which the suspects were backing out of a parking space and nearly struck the victims' vehicle," Warneke said of the 10 p.m. (12 a.m. ET) incident.
The Denver Broncos referred questions to Stadium Management Company, which runs the team's stadium. The company said it was aware of the incident and was working with authorities.
This is second violent incident after a Broncos game this month.
A 30-year-old man died after he fought another person in a parking lot near the Kansas City Chiefs' Arrowhead Stadium on December 1. That incident happened after a game between the Chiefs and the Broncos.
