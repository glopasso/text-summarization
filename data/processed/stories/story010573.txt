(EW.com) -- This is the most exciting TV development news we've heard in awhile.
CBS TV Studios is in the very early stages of a new version of the classic series "The Twilight Zone."
Bryan Singer ("X-Men") is attached as executive producer. There is no writer and no attached network at this time. So this project could go nowhere. But the development wheels are turning.
Creator-host Rod Serling's original 1959-64 edition of "The Twilight Zone" is considered one of the best shows of all time. Attempts to revive the series have largely struggled â€” there was a 1985 edition that ran for three seasons (two on CBS, one in syndication), and another in 2002 on UPN that lasted only one season.

Yet a potential revival now of this ground-breaking anthology show makes sense. Sci-fi and horror series are delivering big ratings (AMC's "The Walking Dead," NBC's "Revolution") and there's several other genre projects coming to the small screen (NBC's "Hannibal" and "Dracula"; CBS' "Under the Dome").
Networks have become less squeamish about edgy content, which has allowed producers to more realistically depict dark subject matter. Plus, FX already took a step toward successfully reviving the anthology format by launching American Horror Story, a drama with close-ended seasons.
There's been a second "Twilight Zone" movie mired in development for several years now too, with Leonardo DiCaprio attached as executive producer. The film is reportedly about a test pilot who returns to Earth after an experimental flight to discover it's 96 years in the future.
