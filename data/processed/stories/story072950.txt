Marussia will head into the 2012 Formula One season with an untried car after the team's new MR01 failed a crucial crash test.
New regulations introduced by motorsport's governing body, the FIA, require each car to pass 18 observed crash tests before it can be driven in preseason testing.
The Russian-owned team -- formerly known as Virgin -- has now withdrawn from the last official test event in Barcelona this week to focus on passing the final requirement ahead of the season-opening race in Australia on March 18.
"We are disappointed to confirm that the planned first test of the 2012 race car has been delayed as a consequence of not passing the final FIA crash test," the Britain-based team said in a statement on Tuesday.

"Despite the fact that the MR01 has passed all 17 of the preceding tests, the regulations require the car to have completed all of the tests before running commences."
The only other team to have failed the 18th test is Marussia's fellow minnow HRT, but the Spanish marque revealed over the weekend it had now completed all required evaluations.
Marussia's drivers -- experienced German Timo Glock and French rookie Charles Pic -- did take part in last week's test event, also in Barcelona, but were only able to run the 2011 car.
The duo will be hoping to register the team's first point in Formula One, having finished the last two seasons bottom of the constructors' table.
