Everton hit back from going a goal behind to earn a 1-1 home draw with Birmingham City, a result that lifts the visitors out of the bottom three of the Premier League table.
English League Cup winners Birmingham came into the match third from bottom and they took a vital lead in the 17th minute.
Jean Beausejour was on target with a close-range header after out-jumping defender Tony Hibbert from a Jordon Mutch cross -- the Chilean's second goal in as many matches.
But Everton levelled just before half-time when Dutchman John Heitinga curled a superb shot into the top corner, after Birmingham failed to clear Leon Osman's corner.
Everton enjoyed the majority of possession and chances after the break. Louis Saha's shot was stopped by Mutch's brave block while Birmingham goalkeeper Ben Foster saved well from Jermaine Beckford's close-range strike.
The result means Everton move up a place to ninth in the table, while the point sees Birmingham rise above West Ham on goal difference to 17th place.
