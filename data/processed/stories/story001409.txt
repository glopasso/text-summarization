A Philadelphia priest convicted of a sex crime involving a 10-year-old boy has died while awaiting appeal, his church said Tuesday.
The Rev. Charles Engelhardt, who was a priest at St. Jerome Parish in northeast Philadelphia, died Saturday of multi-system organ failure and a complete heart blockage at 67, Father Kevin Nadolski said.
Engelhardt was in the process of appealing his sentence of 6 to 12 years in prison, stemming from his conviction relating to the indecent assault of a 10-year-old boy in the late 1990s. He was also convicted of endangering the welfare of a child, corruption of a minor, and conspiracy.
The Superior Court of Pennsylvania granted and heard arguments from Engelhardt last month as part of his year-and-a-half appeals process.
He has maintained his innocence throughout the trial and appeal, having pleaded not guilty to sexual abuse and conspiracy charges back in 2011. "I continue to believe that he's completely innocent," Father Nadolski said.
Englehardt's victim, now in his 20s, reported to authorities in 2009 that he was sexually abused while he was in Catholic grade school by Engelhardt and other priests. A grand jury determined his allegations had merit, and the priests were subsequently charged and arrested. They were among dozens of Philadelphia priests accused of sex abuse in a grand jury report.
Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said at the time of conviction that the prison sentence "sends a clear message to sexual assault victims in Philadelphia. If you come forward, you will be heard," he said.  Williams called the verdict "just."
A parochial teacher, Bernard Shero, who authorities said raped the same boy in 2000, was convicted of rape, attempted rape, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse, indecent sexual assault and other charges. He is still being held in the Houtzdale, Pennsylvania State Prison.
