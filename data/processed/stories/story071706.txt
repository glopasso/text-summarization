(CNN Student News) -- November 18, 2014
CNN Student News is launching a series today on affording the cost of college. Our first report centers on an apprenticeship program that allows students to earn while they learn. We're also looking into how political groups may have used Twitter to circumvent campaign finance rules, and we report on why several NFL teams were recently visited by U.S. government agents.
