At a college reunion, it's common for alumni to share post-collegiate achievements with each other.
But a report compiled for this year's 50th reunion class at Harvard University contained an unusual entry.
Ted Kaczynski, the so-called "Unabomber" and Harvard alumnus, listed his eight life sentences for a string of bombings that killed three people and wounded 23 others as an "award" in the class of 1962 report.
The Harvard Alumni Association said in a statement Thursday that they "regret publishing Kaczynski's references to his convictions and apologize for any distress that it may have caused others."
The Boston Globe published an apparent photo of the entry, which lists Kaczynski's occupation as "prisoner" and his address as "No 04475-046, US Penitentiary-Max, P.O. Box 8500, Florence, CO 8126-8500."
In the section where alumni list their awards, Kaczynski's entry reads: "eight life sentences, issued by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, 1998."
Kaczynski's entry was published in a class reunion report, which was distributed in advance of the 1962 reunion.
All members of the class who submit their own entries are included in each year's report, according to the alumni association.
Kaczynski was arrested in 1996 and pleaded guilty in 1998 for sending bombs through the mail from 1978 to 1995.
