Global warming and environmental concerns are some of the themes being explored at a major exhibition of African photography.
The Bamako Encounters African Photography Biennial, held in the Malian capital of Bamako, has gathered together the works of some of Africa's finest photographers and videographers.
The exhibition has been held every other year since 1994, but this year's show features a number of works examining ecological issues.
In pictures: Life in 'trash land' captured by photographer
A series of works entitled "The Hell of Copper," by Burkina Faso-born Nyaba Léon Ouedraogo, shows how a dump in Ghana's capital Accra is used to dispose of electronic waste from Europe and the United States.
"A Look," by Congolese photographer and filmmaker Kiripi Katembo, shows flooding in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa. "Climate change," by Nyani Quarmyne, shows a resident of a Ghanaian fishing village sitting on top of his home -- which is rapidly disappearing beneath the sand as the sea encroaches on the village.
The exhibition is supported by the Insititut Francais and runs until 1 January 2012.
