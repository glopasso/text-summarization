Borussia Dortmund are back on top of the German Bundesliga table after a 2-0 victory at title rivals Mainz on Sunday.
Teenager Mario Goetze opened the scoring for the visitors in the 26th minute when he punished a mistake from Niko Bungert before firing home.
Mainz then wasted a golden opportunity to level matters when midfielder Eugen Polanski's 47th-minute penalty was well saved by Dortmund captain Roman Weidenfeller.
And Dortmund made the home side pay for missing that spot-kick when they added a second goal midway through the second half, Paraguayan striker Lucas Barrios netting his fifth of the season from a tight angle.
The result means Dortmund overtake Mainz by a point at the top of the table with 25 points from their 10 matches.
Despite the defeat, Mainz remain six points clear of Hoffenheim, who moved up to third on Sunday, ahead of Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, with a comfortable 4-0 victory over Hanover.
Iceland midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson scored twice for Hoffenheim with Demba Ba and Peniel Mlapa also on target.
Meanwhile, in Spain's Primera Liga, third-placed Villarreal lost ground on Real Madrid and Barcelona at the top of the table after a 1-1 draw at Sporting Gijon on Sunday.
Diego Castro opened the scoring for the home side in the 68th minute and Villarreal needed a last-gasp penalty from Italian forward Giuseppe Rossi -- his sixth goal of the season -- to salvage a point.
The result extends Villarreal's unbeaten league run to eight matches, but they are now three points behind Real Madrid at the top of the table.
Elsewhere, Atletico Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw at home to strugglers Almeria and go into next weekend's Madrid derby against Real down in seventh place in the table.
Sergio Aguero put Atletico ahead but Pablo Piatti levelled for the visitors on the stroke of half-time.
Earlier on Sunday, Deportivo La Coruna finally recorded their first win of the season with a 3-0 home victory over Espanyol at the Riazor Stadium.
