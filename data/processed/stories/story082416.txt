(CNN)  -- Cristiano Ronaldo is to play in a special benefit match for the victims of the Madeira floods and mudslides which have claimed the lives of at least 42 people.
The world's most expensive player has made himself available for a game between Portuguese champions Porto and a joint team from Madeira-based clubs Nacional and Maritimo.
No date has yet been set for the match, but Ronaldo has said he will help in "whatever possible way" after the tragic events of the weekend.
Porto coach Jesualdo Ferreira added: "Porto want to express their condolences for all that has happened and, as a club, do everything necessary to help Madeira."
Real Madrid forward Ronaldo was born and grew up in Madeira and has a special football center named after him, which is next to the Nacional stadium.
The 24-year-old paid his own tribute after scoring the first goal in Real's 6-2 rout of Villarreal on Sunday, lifting his shirt to reveal a t-shirt bearing the name "Madeira" on the chest.
"Nobody can be indifferent to such a tragedy, especially me," Ronaldo told the official Real Madrid Web site, www.realmadrid.com.
"I was born and raised on the island. It's given me so much. This is why I want to make myself available to help in whatever possible way.
"I would like to help official bodies and organizations to minimize the effects of this great tragedy and to get over them as soon as possible."
Former World Player of the Year Ronaldo moved to Real Madrid from Manchester United in the summer for a record $120 million fee.
