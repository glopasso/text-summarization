The dinos are back, and this time they've got Star-Lord to contend with.
OK, not really, but that's probably what went through a lot of people's minds watching the newly released trailer for "Jurassic World."
Universal Pictures scored a coup casting Chris Pratt in a lead role in the four-quel, now that he is hot off the success of "Guardians of the Galaxy."
Pratt's character Owen arrives on the scene partway through the trailer, after it's established that John Hammond's vision of a theme park with real dinosaurs has finally come to fruition -- thanks to Bryce Dallas Howard's character, Claire -- with Jurassic World. (Be sure to check out that water show involving what looks to be a basilosaurus leaping out of the water to devour a shark!).
While the movie might not win any awards for scientific accuracy, the trailer has certainly built up a lot of anticipation for its summer 2015 release -- not to mention the fact that we don't get a good look at that genetically modified dinosaur that terrorizes many in the park.
"Jurassic World" opens June 12.
