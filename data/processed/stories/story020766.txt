Former Z-Boys skater Jay Adams died Thursday after a heart attack while vacationing in Mexico with his wife. He was 53.
Adams was enjoying an "endless summer surf vacation," and was set to return to the United States in a couple of days, said Susan Ferris, manager and friend to the Skateboarding Hall of Fame legend. Adams had never experienced any heart issues. Despite previous legal hardships related to substance abuse, Ferris emphasized that Adams was completely sober and had been for a while. "We are honestly shocked."
Fellow Z-Boys member and director of "Dogtown and Z-Boys" Stacy Peralta took to Instagram to mourn Adams, who was commonly known as "The Original Seed." "I just received the terribly sad news that Jay Adams passed away last night due to a massive heart attack, send your love," the post read, alongside a picture of a young Adams.
Z-Boys, shorthand for the Zephyr Competition Team, is a group of skateboarders in Southern California who became widely recognized for their skate tricks in the '70s. In 2005, "Lords of Dogtown," a film based on the original skate crew, was released in theaters. "Lone Survivor" star Emile Hirsch played Adams in the movie.
"This is a great loss to skateboarding," Ferris said, "a true legend died."
Adams is survived by his wife, as well as children from a previous relationship.
