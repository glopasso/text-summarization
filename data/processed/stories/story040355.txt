A man apparently jumped to his death Saturday over a fourth-floor railing at the National Museum of the American Indian, a Smithsonian spokesman said.
The man went over the railing and fell to the ground of the museum's atrium, according to John Gibbons, a Smithsonian spokesman.
Security staff responded immediately, calling for backup and blocking off the area, he added.
Several hundred visitors were evacuated from the museum -- which sits on one end of the Mall, near the U.S. Capitol building. It is expected to reopen Sunday, at its normal time, according to Gibbons.
The district's Metropolitan Police Department is investigating the man's death.
