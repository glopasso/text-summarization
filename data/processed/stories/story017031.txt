(CNN)  -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has stood by his post-match tirade against officialdom after his side lost 2-0 to bitter rivals Barcelona in the first leg of their Champions League semifinal tie Wednesday.
Mourinho spoke of a "scandal" and favoritism towards Barca as both he and central defender Pepe were sent off in the second half.
Down to 10-men, Barcelona brilliantly exploited the advantage in the Bernabeu and scored two late goals through Lionel Messi.
UEFA said Thursday that it had started a disciplinary inquiry into the unsavory incidents which marred the clash of the Spanish giants.
Barcelona are also lodging an official complaint to the European governing body after Mourinho's comments.
But Mourinho told gathered reporters Friday that he would have no more to say on the subject, claiming pictures of the incidents would back up his claims.

"An image is worth more than a thousand words. I said what I said and I have nothing to add," he told the official Real Madrid website.
"Whoever criticizes my words must criticize the images and think that the photos have been edited by photoshop and that the video was staged."
Mourinho said he would be resting key players for this weekend's Spanish league match against Real Zaragoza ahead of the return tie in the Nou Camp Tuesday.
Despite his pessimism about the eventual outcome after Wednesday's defeat, the Portuguese coach refused to write off Real's season.
"Our morale is good in all aspects. The season is not over and only finishes at the end of May," he claimed.
