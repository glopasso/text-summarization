A small plane carrying Hendrick Motorsports owner Rick Hendrick and three others crashed Monday evening after veering off a runway at Florida's Key West International Airport.
Hendrick, his wife Linda and two pilots were on board the Gulfstream G150, according to a statement from Hendrick Motorsports. No one was seriously injured.
The pilots on board had reported no brakes upon landing, according to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office.
"The plane ran completely off the runway, and the (runway) was closed for a short time before being reopened," a statement from the sheriff's office said. "The National Transportation Safety Board was notified and will be investigating the incident."
Authorities said the plane was registered to Jimmie Johnson Racing II Incorporated, out of Charlotte, North Carolina.
Hendrick Motorsports' roster of stock-car drivers includes Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson and Dale Earnhardt Jr., according to the NASCAR team's website.
