(CNN)Two bombs exploded at the entrance to a popular mall Sunday night in Bangkok, police said.
There were no injuries, Lt.Gen. Prawut Thavornsiri, spokesman for Thai police, said on Twitter.
Two IED-type bombs had been placed behind an electric converter booth, he said.
The blasts took place at around 8 p.m., when the mall, called the Siam Paragon, was crowded. The first explosion forced an elevated train to halt service for about 30 minutes.
The immensely popular luxury shopping mall was the most Instagrammed location in the world in 2013.
