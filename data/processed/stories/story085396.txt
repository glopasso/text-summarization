The U.N. Security Council is riddled with double standards and has failed the Middle East, Saudi Arabia said Friday as it rejected an offer to join the body.
The kingdom claims that the council is incapable of keeping the peace internationally, the Saudi foreign ministry said in a statement published by the state news agency SPA.
"To have the Palestinian cause remaining without a fair and permanent solution for 65 years, which resulted in several wars that threatened international peace and security, is evidence and proof of (the) Security Council's inability to perform his duties and responsibilities," the ministry said.
It also blamed the Security Council for not preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction in the region -- especially nuclear weapons, a likely allusion to Saudi Arabia's adversarial neighbor Iran.
Lastly, the kingdom brought up the civil war in Syria, blaming the U.N. for not punishing the government after a poison gas attack there killed hundreds of civilians.
Saudi Arabia supports Syrian rebels and advocates the overthrow of autocratic Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
