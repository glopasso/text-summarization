A 9-year-old boy who hopped a flight from Minnesota to Las Vegas this month was ordered Wednesday to undergo therapy and to live apart from his parents, for now.
According to Nancy Peters, spokeswoman for Hennepin County's Fourth Judicial District in Minneapolis, a judge said the boy's parents should be allowed unlimited visits and phone calls with their son.
Judge Joseph Klein also ordered the mother to have her 9-year-old boy evaluated for special education services, Peters said.
Crew members aboard a Delta Air Lines flight on October 3 became suspicious of their child passenger and then found that he had no ticket or boarding pass. He was placed in a foster home as authorities began an investigation.
'He's got a behavioral problem'
The Transportation Security Administration has said the boy went through security at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, although it has not explained how he did so without a boarding pass.
An airport spokesman said video shows the boy chatted with a Delta agent when he reached the gate and moved toward the plane when the agent became distracted.
Last week, the boy's father tearfully told reporters he had previously asked for help to address the boy's behavior problems, but no one responded.
Drawing a sweatshirt's hood tightly to his face to obscure his identity, the father said he tried to ask assistance from police and social service officials because of his son's previous indiscretions, including allegedly stealing a vehicle just days before the flight.
"I've been asking for help. No one stepped up to help," the dad said, head bowed.
