Roger Federer is through to a tenth consecutive Australian Open semifinal after beating France's Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets at the Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday.
The world No.2 fought off a gutsy challenge from the seventh seed to eventually prevail 7-6 4-6 7-6 3-6 6-3 in three hours 34 minutes to set up a clash with Britain's Andy Murray on Friday.

"It was a tough close for sure but whole match was tough," Federer said.
"You never know what Jo is going to come up with ... I feel a bit lucky to come through, but I felt I played some great tennis and it was a pleasure to play against Jo tonight because he played great too."
Tsonga fought back twice from being a set down and saved four match points, but as so often, Federer prevailed in the deciding fifth set, breaking the Frenchman in the fourth game before going on to serve out the match.
Federer won the last of his four titles in Melbourne against Murray back in 2010 and is relishing facing the Scot again.
"It will be extremely tough. It was great to have seen him play such a great year last year and finally get his first slam, and the Olympic gold was an amazing achievement after a tough loss in the Wimbledon final. I'm looking forward to it. He's a great guy and a great player," Federer said.
Earlier, Murray dispatched Jeremy Chardy in straight sets 6-4 6-1 6-2 to reach his fourth consecutive Australian Open semifinal.
The world No.3 overpowered the unseeded Frenchman -- who knocked out Juan Martin del Potro in the third round -- in one hour 51 minutes.
"Today was the best I've played so far," Murray said afterwards.
"I struggled in my last few rounds and I knew he'd beaten some top players. I knew I had to be sharp. I moved well today."
World No.1 Novak Djokovic and Spain's David Ferrer will meet in the other semifinal on Thursday.
