 A man accused of shooting two students at a Littleton, Colorado, middle school last week was formally charged Tuesday in the incident, according to a spokeswoman for the Jefferson County district attorney's office.
Bruco Strongeagle Eastwood, 32, appeared via video link before Judge Thomas Vance to hear the 15 charges against him, which include attempted first-degree murder, first-degree assault, child abuse resulting in bodily injury and possession of a weapon on school grounds, district attorney spokeswoman Pam Russell said.
He is being held with bond set at $1 million.
Authorities accuse Eastwood of shooting at students outside Deer Creek Middle School on February 23 shortly after classes let out for the day. Police say he wounded two eighth-graders before being subdued by a teacher.
One student, Reagan Weber, was treated and released from Littleton Adventist Hospital, according to CNN affiliate KUSA. The other, Matthew Thieu, sustained more serious injuries and was hospitalized at Denver's Children's Hospital. He has since been released, the hospital said Tuesday.
An attorney was appointed for Eastwood, and the attorney has until March 12 to schedule a preliminary hearing, Russell said.
Deer Creek is just two miles from Columbine High School, site of one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history, where 12 students and one teacher were gunned down in 1999. The two gunmen, both Columbine students, then turned their guns on themselves.
