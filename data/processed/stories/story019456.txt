At least 20 people have died in severe flooding in Vietnam, official media reported Monday.
But the death toll varied as the state-run Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said the death toll is 30 as of Sunday, sourcing a government flood committee.
Floods damaged crops and hindered transportation leaving passengers stranded in trains and blocking roadways, and flood waters covered more than 150,000 homes, VNA reported.
Seven died in Ha Tinh province after Sunday's rainfall reached more that 800 millimeters (31.5 inches), according to VietNamNet. The province accounted for more than half the homes reported flooded.
A similar amount of rain fell on Nghe An province, triggering flooding that killed eight people but inundating far fewer homes, VietNamNet reported. Four more died in Quang Binh province.
One person has been reported missing in this week's floods.
Throughout the region, people and cattle could be seen sitting on roofs, while boats floated through what would otherwise have been the nation's streets. About 1 meter of water lay over some parts of a Highway 1A, a north-south connection through Vietnam, and service on the north-south railway through the southeastern Asian nation was suspended, reported state-run Vietnam News.
The Vietnamese government is distributing 2,000 tons of rice and $10 million worth of aid to the worst-hit areas, in Ha Trinh and Quang Binh provinces, reports said.
Record-setting rains a few weeks earlier in central Vietnam spurred severe flooding that killed 66 people and inundated more than 10,000 dwellings. Hundreds of Vietnamese troops were dispatched to the region in the first week of October to help with rescue operations and help residents and business owners deal with millions of dollars of damage.
