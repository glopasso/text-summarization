The largest agency in the fight against worldwide hunger is increasing its efforts to assist millions of people affected by famine and drought in the Horn of Africa.
On Tuesday, the World Food Programme began a series of nine airlifts to Mombasa, Kenya, according to a statement from the WFP.
The total deliveries will bring enough "high-energy biscuits," to feed 1.6 million people for a day.
On Monday evening, a cargo aircraft landed in Nairobi with ,"Plumpy Sup," a high nutrient substance designed to feed malnourished children under age five, according to WFP officials.
Over the next two months, the agency is working to deliver a "super cereal to Somalia," the WFP statement said. The corn and soya-based blended food is fortified with essential micro-nutrients, dried milk powder, sugar and fat that is used for moderately malnourished children from six to 23 months.
About 100,000 Somalis have flocked to Mogadishu in search of food and potable water, which have disappeared in a devastating famine and drought, according to the U.N. They join more than 370,000 internal refugees already in the capital in war-torn southern Somalia, many of whom also face hunger.
Online donations to the organization have surpassed $3 million, according to the WFP statement, but the financial goal for efforts to help refugees in the Horn of Africa remains $250 million short of current needs.
The agency is working to deliver at least 14,000 metric tons (more than 15,000 U.S. tons) of energy and nutrient rich resources to help feed starving refugees in region.
The U.N. declared famine in five areas of southern Somalia in June, including Mogadishu. In all, about 12 million people in the Horn of Africa region need assistance. Somalia is the worst hit.
Each year, according the WFP, the agency feeds more than 90 million people in more than 70 countries.
