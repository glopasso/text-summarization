Brazil's men's football team are one win away from an historic first Olympic title after a 3-0 defeat of South Korea in Tuesday's semifinal at London 2012.
The five-time world champions, who have also won the South American championship on eight occasions, will play Mexico at Wembley Stadium on Saturday in the gold medal match.
