The Florida A&M University marching band's fraternity charter has been revoked for five years because of a hazing incident two years ago, the Kappa Kappa Psi National Fraternity said Monday.
Florida A&M President James Ammons announced Tuesday that the band would remain on suspension through the 2012-2013 academic year after another hazing that resulted in the death of a student last November.
Thirteen people have been charged in connection with the death of Robert Champion, 26, who was badly beaten during last year's incident on a band bus after a football game in Orlando.
The 28 fraternity members and alumnus members who were present during a hazing in the spring of 2010 have been expelled from the fraternity, the group said.
The school's Delta Iota chapter can apply to reactivate its charter in May 2017, it said.
