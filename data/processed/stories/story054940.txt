Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former International Monetary Fund chief who was at one time accused of sexually assaulting a hotel maid in New York, is threatening to sue a Belgian sex club using the initials "D.S.K."
The Dodo Sex Klub is due to open Wednesday in Blaton, a town on the Belgian-French border.
Strauss-Kahn is often referred to as "DSK," especially by the French media.
The former head of the IMF "will take all legal measures necessary to cease the smearing of his name," according to a statement released by five French and Belgian lawyers. Strauss-Kahn's attorney had no further comment when contacted by CNN.
The club's owner, Dominique Alderweireld, owns a string of prostitution houses in Belgium. And he's no stranger to Strauss-Kahn. Later this year, Alderweireld will be on trial, along with Strauss-Kahn, on charges of "aggravated pimping" for their alleged participation in a prostitution ring at the Hotel Carlton in Lille, in northern France.
In 2011, a maid at New York's Sofitel Hotel accused Strauss-Kahn of trying to force himself on her when she came to clean his room. He was indicted on seven counts, including sexual assault and attempted rape, but all the charges were dropped after prosecutors found inconsistencies in the woman's story.
The woman later filed a civil lawsuit against Strauss-Kahn. The two reached a settlement in 2012, but the terms were not disclosed.
