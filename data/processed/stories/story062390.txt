Jason Derulo has a message for fans worried about his breakup with Jordin Sparks: "Everything is cool."
The "Talk Dirty to Me" singer did an interview with a Twin Cities radio station on Thursday and initially did not want to address reports that he had split with the season 6 "American Idol" winner. The pair were first linked romantically three years ago and have been open about their adoration.
But Derulo, 25, confirmed that the pair are no longer together. He said that they will remain friends and that all is well.
"Yeah, everything is cool, man," he continued. "It's not a bad situation. You know, it's not one of those kinda things."
There was no hint of trouble when the couple strolled the red carpet at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. After Sparks, 24, appeared in the video for Derulo's song "Marry Me," had many fans expecting a proposal soon.
In August, Derulo told E! News he planned on popping the question to Sparks "when the time is right for sure."
