The office of House Speaker John Boehner slammed comments by an architect of Obamacare who said the health care law was sold to the American public with misleading messaging, arguing Jonathan Gruber's remarks confirm the ill-will behind passage of the law.
"If there was ever any doubt that ObamaCare was rammed through Congress with a heavy dose of arrogance, duplicity, and contempt for the will of the American people, recent comments made by ... Jonathan Gruber, put that to rest," Boehner's office said said in a statement Thursday.
Videos recently emerged showing Gruber suggesting that the administration exploited the "the stupidity of the American voter" and the "lack of economic understanding of the American voter" in pushing the Affordable Care Act.

In the statement, Boehner's office said, "the American people are anything but 'stupid.' They're the ones bearing the consequences of the president's health care law and, unsurprisingly, they continue to oppose it."
White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pushed back against Gruber's comments in a press briefing in Myanmar, saying, "I disagree vigorously with" the assessment that the White House passed the law by taking advantage of what they saw as the voters' lack of intelligence.
"This was a very difficult undertaking but ultimately this is a law that has had significant benefits for millions of people," he said, adding that Republicans are the ones "who have been less than forthright and transparent about what their proposed changes to the Affordable Care Act would do in terms of the choices are available to middle class families."
For his part, Gruber said Tuesday on MSNBC that he "was speaking off the cuff" and "spoke inappropriately."
"And I regret making those comments," he added.
