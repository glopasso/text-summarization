(The Hollywood Reporter)Roseanne Barr has revealed that she is slowly going blind.

"It's something weird. But there are other weird things. That one's harsh, 'cause I read a lot, and then I thought, 'Well, I guess I could hire somebody to read for me and read to me.' But I like words and I like looking. You do what you have to do. I just try and enjoy vision as much as possible -- y'know, living it up. My dad had it, too," the actress said.
Barr also defended her use of pot, saying, "It's expansive. It opens your mind" and "It makes you wonder. It doesn't close that down."
