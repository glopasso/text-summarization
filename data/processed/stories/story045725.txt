(Rolling Stone) -- Eminem revealed that he has started work on his next solo record during an interview with Hot 97's Peter Rosenberg this morning.
"I'm kinda getting into my next record a little bit," the Detroit rapper said.
The album will be his first solo record since 2010's "Recovery," and the new record will be the followup to "Hell The Sequel," the debut from his collaborative project with Royce da 5'9", Bad Meets Evil.
That's not all Eminem is working on: He's completing work on a new album from the hip-hop supergroup Slaughterhouse, he said. Their Shady Records debut is out June 12th.
Back in April, the four members of Slaughterhouse -- Royce da 5'9", Joe Budden, Joell Ortiz and Crooked I -- spoke with Rolling Stone about the new record, "Welcome To: Our House," and Eminem's contribution as executive producer.
"He'll come in and say 'Maybe change a line here, change a verse there, maybe move this around, let me add an instrument here,'" said Royce. "That's just what an executive producer does . . . From day one, Marshall was hands-on."
During his chat with Rosenberg, Eminem also confirmed that Slaughterhouse will play Hot 97's Summer Jam, which takes place June 3 at MetLife Stadium.
