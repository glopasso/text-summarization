A former flight attendant whose repeated bomb threats caused massive headaches for United Airlines and inconvenienced thousands of travelers has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
A federal judge in Los Angeles sentenced Patrick Cau, 40, on Monday, ordering him to pay $304,495 in restitution to United and $8,838 to the Los Angeles Police Department.
Authorities said Cau, a German national also known as Patrick Kaiser, made eight bomb threats in late 2012 and early 2013 to United after being fired by the airline.
Most of the phone threats targeted United jets on his old route between Los Angeles and London.
Some of the calls occurred while he was training for a new flight attendant job with American Airlines.
The bomb threats disrupted law enforcement agencies and inconvenienced passengers. Officials evacuated planes, re-screened passengers and searched bags and cargo, but did not find explosives.
Cau, of Dallas, pleaded guilty in August to one count of false information and hoaxes, but in a plea agreement admitted to making eight bomb threats.
Cau's lawyer, Craig Charles, said Cau was given credit for the six months he has already served, leaving him with about a year left on the sentence. He faces possible deportation to Germany when he gets out, Charles said.
"My client was very clear that he was remorseful for the things that were done. He wishes to put this behind him and move on with his life," Charles said.
