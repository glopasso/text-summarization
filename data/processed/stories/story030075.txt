Queen Elizabeth II has a new profile pic. @BritishMonarchy tweeted the image Sunday, noting it was released to mark her 88th birthday Monday.
It's not a selfie. In fact, famed British photographer David Bailey took it at Buckingham Palace last month, according to the BBC.
"I've always been a huge fan of the Queen," Bailey told the BBC. "She has very kind eyes with a mischievous glint. I've always liked strong women, and she is a very strong woman."
The black and white photo shows the Queen with a broad smile and three strands of pearls around her royal neck. #HappyBirthdayYourMajesty
The BBC report said the portrait was commissioned by Britain's "Great" campaign to promote tourism and trade in the United Kingdom
