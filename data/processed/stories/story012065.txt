(EW.com) -- Nine years after "Bruce Almighty," Universal is plotting a second coming. (Or technically a third.)
EW has confirmed a Variety report that the studio has plans to reunite Jim Carrey with the "Yes Man" writers (Jarrad Paul and Andrew Mogel) for a new chapter in the life of the newscaster who is handed God's powers and responsibilities after complaining about the big man's negligence.
The 2003 film, which co-starred Morgan Freeman as God, Jennifer Aniston as Bruce's wife, and Steve Carell as his hated rival, grossed more than $484 million worldwide, making it Carrey's biggest hit.
This wouldn't be the first "Bruce" sequel; "Evan Almighty" attempted to hand the reins over to Carell's character, but that expensive, effects-heavy 2007 film underperformed and barely grossed $100 million.
