New York police said Thursday that they will talk to an inmate who admitted to being part of the 1994 robbery and shooting of rapper Tupac Shakur.
The  inmate was quoted on the website allhiphop.com this week admitting to  being a part of the attack and saying he was paid by a music  mogul for it.
"Detectives are going to speak to the individual," a New York Police spokesman said early Thursday morning.
Shakur publicly blamed the 1994 attack, which occurred at a music studio  in New York, on Christopher "Notorious B.I.G." Wallace and Sean "P-Diddy"  Combs.
While Shakur survived the 1994 attack, he was fatally shot in Las Vegas in 1996. Wallace was shot and killed in 1997 in Los Angeles. Both murders have not been solved.
The 1994 shooting and robbing of Shakur is viewed as sparking the infamous West Coast versus East Coast feud in rap music, which ultimately led to the shooting deaths of both Wallace and Shakur.
The hip hop website named the inmate as Dexter Isaac and said he is an inmate currently  serving life in prison for an unrelated murder and robbery.
Isaac apologized to Shakur's family for the incident and blamed it on the music mogul. CNN is witholding the music executive's name because he has not been reached for comment.
