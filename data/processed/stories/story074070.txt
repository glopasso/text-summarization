Brazilian driver Bruno Senna will replace Nick Heidfeld for Renault at this weekend's Formula One grand prix in Belgium.
Senna, the nephew of three-time world champion Ayrton Senna, joined the British-based team as a test driver in July and has yet to race competitively for the marque.
German racer Heidfeld has picked up 34 points so far this season and secured a podium finish when he crossed the line in third position at April's Malaysian Grand Prix.
Senna's last race was the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in November 2010, where he placed 19th for HRT.

The Sao Paulo-born driver competed for Spanish outfit HRT on 18 occasions last season with his best finish of the season a 14th place in South Korea.
Heidfeld, formerly of Sauber, was drafted in by Renault at the start of the 2011 season as a replacement for Robert Kubica, after the Pole suffered injuries to his arms and legs in a rally crash in February.
After his rookie year with Prost in 2000, Heidfeld spent three years with Sauber before joining Jordan in 2004.
The 34-year-old spent a season with Williams in 2005 and returned for a second spell with Sauber, who had be taken over by BMW, in 2006.
