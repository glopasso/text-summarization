"I don't have any problem doing anything," Johnson tells Elle magazine of portraying Anastasia Steele, the young woman who gets a sexual education with a very steep learning curve in E.L. James' erotic novel.
"The secret," she says "is I have no shame."
As the daughter of Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, Dakota has been determined to act since adolescence. But it wasn't until she was cast as Ana Steele -- much to the chagrin of some fans -- that she became more of a household name.

And it wasn't just the sure-to-be-publicized sex scenes that drew Johnson in.
"Reading the book, I found myself more interested in the ways they were breaking each other down emotionally than the sex scenes," Johnson explains to Elle. "I think there's a part of a woman that wants to be the thing that breaks a man down."
Or, perhaps, she wants to be the thing that breaks down an audience that didn't quite believe in her.
