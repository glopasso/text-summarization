The daughter of Sen. Dick Durbin died Saturday from a congenital heart condition, the Illinois Democrat's office said.
"Chris Durbin, 40, fought a heroic lifelong battle with heart disease and our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Durbin family," said Durbin's spokesman, Joe Shoemaker.
Chris Durbin worked for 16 years for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington.
Survivors include her husband, Marty Johnson, and son, Alex.
Her death comes as Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, seeks a third term in Tuesday's general election.
Funeral arrangements for his daughter were not immediately announced.
