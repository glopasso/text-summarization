Four people died and two others were seriously injured in a boating accident on the Hudson River in eastern New York early Sunday, authorities said.
"The preliminary investigation has revealed that the boat, a 19-foot 1999 Chriscraft, was being operated northbound on the Hudson River approximately 10-15 yards off the eastern shore (near the Dutchess/Columbia County line) when it struck a concrete footing," a statement from the Dutchess County Sheriff's Office said.
The deaths included three people who went down with the boat and a fourth who was ejected, according to the sheriff's office. The two who survived were able to swim to shore. One of them was able to get to a phone to report the accident.
The incident took place near the city of Red Hook, about 90 miles north of New York City.
