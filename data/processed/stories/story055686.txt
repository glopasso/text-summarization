An accident at a nuclear facility in Arkansas killed one person Sunday, a county coroner said.
The accident took place "in a non-radiation area, and there has been no risk to public health and safety identified," the Arkansas Department of Health said in a statement.
The facility is Arkansas Nuclear One, a water reactor in Russellville.
"We can understand the concern of all Arkansans about the situation at Arkansas Nuclear One," Dr. William Mason, head of the department's Preparedness and Emergency Response branch, said. "We are closely monitoring what's happening there and will make recommendations for additional action if the need arises."
The statement added that Mason "urges residents to take this time to review their Emergency Instructions Booklet" and emergency information in phone directories.
Pope County Coroner Leonard Krout said the victim was Wade Walters, 24, of Russellville.
Officials have not said how he was killed.
