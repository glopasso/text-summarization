Is there an unspoken rule in Hollywood that celebrity parents can only pick unusual names for their kids?
On Instagram on Sunday, Kourtney Kardashian revealed that she and partner Scott Disick went with Reign Aston as the name of their third child, a boy they welcomed on December 14.
Over the weekend, Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard welcomed their second child, a daughter they named Delta Bell.
And that's after the arrival earlier this year of Royal Reign, the daughter of rapper Lil' Kim, and Apollo Bowie Flynn, the son of Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale.
All of those names are obviously precious to the parents who picked them, but they're not exactly the equivalent of monikers such as Sophia or Jackson, which according to BabyCenter.com, were the top two baby names in 2014.
Not every celebrity picks the most unusual name they can think of -- John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, for example, welcomed daughter Hazel this year -- but most of the time it seems the famous are competing in some sort of special baby-name Olympics.
Here are some of the more distinct baby names we've heard of this year -- who do you think had the most unique?
