(CNN)  -- Narain Karthikeyan is to return to Formula One this season after signing for the Hispania team.
Karthikeyan, the first Indian to race in F1, will be returning the circuit after a six- year absence.
"It's been a while in the making, but I am extremely happy to be racing again in Formula 1 in 2011," he told the Spanish team's official website.
"I am confident that I still have the pace, the fitness and the will to succeed in Formula 1 .
"I'm also looking forward to racing at the first ever Indian Grand Prix in October," added the 33-year-old.
Karthikeyan, dubbed "the fastest Indian in the world" raced for the now defunct Jordan team in 2005 and was a test driver for Williams in the following two seasons.
Since then he has competed for India in the World Cup of Motorsport series and he has raced in the Le Mans 24-hour classic, finishing seventh.
Hispania principal Colin Kolles hopes that Karthikeyan's previous experience help can help his team.
"I have known Narain for a long time and he can revert to the experiences he gained when he was competing for Jordan Grand Prix and as reserve driver for Williams.
"I am sure that his experience and speed will be very useful for the team during the season."
Hispania finished 11th out of 12th in their first season in 2010.
They have yet to announce who will drive alongside Karthikeyan but have said Bruno Senna, who competed last year, is not in the line-up.
