India made Edgbaston a home from home Sunday to beat England by five runs in the final of the ICC Champions Trophy.
After rain had reduced the allocated 50 overs per side to just 20 overs each, India successfully defended their 129 for seven score as England fell agonizingly five runs short.
Roared on by thousands of their fans, who formed the majority of the crowd at the ground in Birmingham, the reigning 50 overs world champions again showed their mettle in one-day cricket.
Chasing a moderate target, but on a worn pitch taking spin, England looked well-placed to win after a fine stand between Eoin Morgan (33) and Ravi Bopara (30).
But paceman Ishant Sharma, who looked the weak link in the Indian attack, then struck back by claiming the pair in successive balls in the 18th over.
Two more wickets fell in the next over bowed by left arm spinner Ravi Jadeja to leave England reeling.
Tailender James Tredwell needed a six off the last ball bowled by Ravichandra Ashwin, but his desperate heave was unsuccessful.
It left India to celebrate, having gone through the eight-team tournament undefeated, while England are still waiting for a global one-day international trophy.
They have lost in the final of three World Cups and the final of the 2004 staging of the Champions Trophy in England.
They will now turn their attentions to the battle for the famous Ashes against old foes Australia -- with the first Test taking place next month.
For India, it's another triumph under the captaincy of MS Dhoni, but victory looked unlikely after a below par batting display, only lifted by an excellent late stand from top scorer Virat Kohli (43) and the ever dangerous Jadeja, who was named man of the match.
Dhoni was proud his team kept their nerve at the death.
"We handled the pressure really well. People talk about technique but the better players are the ones who respond to the pressure," he told Sky Sports.
