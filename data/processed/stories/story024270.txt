Jimi Jamison, who belted out the hits "The Search is Over" and "Burning Heart" for 1980s rock band Survivor, has died. He was 63.
"The entire Survivor family is very shocked and saddened by the passing of our brother Jimi Jamison," the band's official Facebook page said. "Our thoughts, love and prayers go out to his family and friends."
Jamison joined the band in 1984 after Survivor scored the No. 1 hit "Eye of the Tiger," from the "Rocky III" soundtrack. Original lead singer Dave Bickler left the band for medical reasons.
Jamison sang on five Top 20 singles. In addition to "The Search is Over," which peaked at No. 4, and "Burning Heart," which made it to No. 2 on the charts and was on the "Rocky IV" soundtrack, Jamison provided vocals for "I Can't Hold Back," "High on You," and "Is This Love."
Survivor disbanded in 1989, according to the band's biography on AllMusic.com.
Survivor returned to the studio in 1993 with Bickler back on lead vocals to record a couple of new songs for a greatest hits package. Jamison later rejoined the lineup in 2000.
Fans of TV's "Baywatch" might also recognize his voice. He sang and helped pen the show's theme song, "I'm Always Here."
