(CNN)Athlete, marathoner -- and now swimsuit model.
Caroline Wozniacki has appeared in Sports Illustrated's famous swimsuit edition this year, becoming the latest tennis player to don a bikini in a shoot for the renown U.S. publication.
Her pal, world No. 1 Serena Williams, along with Maria Sharapova and Ana Ivanovic, have featured in the swimsuit edition in the past and the Dane couldn't wait to join them.
So much so Wozniacki approached the magazine, not vice versa.
"It's always been a dream of mine (to be in the swimsuit Issue)," Wozniacki, a former No. 1 like Sharapova and Ivanovic, told the For The Win website Monday in New York.
"I went to the offices of Sports Illustrated quite a few months ago and threw myself out there. 'If you need a model or want one, I'm here.'
"It must have made a pretty good impression.
"Because I travel the world so much and play all over the place and spend so much time over here, the issue is a huge deal for me and my family. I think because I'm in it this year, Denmark is going crazy about it this year and that's fun to see."
Wozniacki posted pictures of the shoot on Twitter -- and one of her other friends on the tour, Victoria Azarenka, was impressed, calling the photos "stunning." The magazine hit the newsstands this week.
Azarenka dumped the Dane out of the Australian Open -- this season's first grand slam -- in straight sets in the second round.
While Wozniacki waits for her first grand slam title, her inclusion in the swimsuit edition is likely to do no harm to her off court profile.
Last September she did reach the U.S. Open final in New York -- losing to Williams -- and returned to the Big Apple a few months later to take part in the New York City Marathon.
