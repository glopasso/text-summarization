(EW.com ) -- "The Daily Show" has hired another correspondent in the wake of John Oliver's exit.
"Saturday Night Live" writer and standup comic Michael Che will join the Comedy Central series in June after he finishes his stint at "SNL." The hire follows the exit of Oliver, who launched his new HBO talk show, "Last Week Tonight," on Sunday. "The Daily Show" also recently added Jordan Klepper last March.
Che is an NYC standup comic who joined the "SNL" writing staff last fall. Che started doing standup in 2010, and since then has won New York's Funniest Stand-Up Competition, appeared on CBS' "Late Show," and was a regular on VH1â€²s short-lived "Best Week Ever" reboot. He's been writing for "SNL" since 2013.
