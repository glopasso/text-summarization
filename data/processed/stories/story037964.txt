Police have arrested Markale Deandra Hart, 22, in connection with the shooting death of a freshman Auburn University football player, the Auburn Police Division said in a news release Sunday.
The Camp Hill man is being charged with murder in the death of 18-year-old Jakell Mitchell of Opelika, Alabama, police say.
"An investigation into the shooting was immediately initiated by the Auburn Police Division and as a result, Hart was developed as a suspect," the statement said. "Auburn Detectives traveled to Dadeville and with the assistance of the Tallapoosa County Sheriff Department and Jackson Gap Police, were able to locate Hart and take him into custody." Dadeville, Alabama, is about 30 miles northwest of Auburn and Opelika.
Hart was taken to Lee County Jail and is being held on a $150,000 bond. No more arrests are expected, police said.
Mitchell was shot and killed at an off-campus apartment complex overnight, police said Sunday.
Mitchell was a freshman football player, according to news website AL.com.
He had signed with Auburn this year but sat the season out to gain weight and train for next year, AL.com reported. He had played high school football in nearby Opelika.
He was a good receiver and runner, according to the Auburn Tigers' website.
"He's a fantastic athlete that is going to be able to do a lot for us," Coach Scott Fountain told the Tigers' website after Mitchell signed on.
University spokesman Mike Clardy confirmed Mitchell's identity.
"The thoughts and prayers of all of us at Auburn University are with his family during this difficult time," he said.
