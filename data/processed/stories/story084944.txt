World champion Sebastian Vettel has taken an early stranglehold on this year's championship after his second straight win in the Malaysian Grand Prix at Sepang.
Vettel won the season-opener in Austrlia and has now claimed fourth successive victories after two at the end of the 2010 season to clinch the title.
Red Bull's Vettel led from start to finish to come home ahead of McLaren's Jenson Button with Nick Heidfeld giving Lotus Renault their second podium of the season.
