Federal authorities on Friday arrested a man on a weapons charge as he was being released from a Los Angeles County jail a day after he pleaded guilty in the 2011 brutal beating of a Giants fan at Dodgers Stadium and received credit for time served.
Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives took Marvin Norwood, 33, into custody Friday morning on a federal weapons charge as the Los Angeles County sheriff released him.
Norwood was sentenced Thursday to four years in prison immediately after pleading guilty to felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. He was released Friday with credit for having been held in jail in the case for more than two years.
A co-defendant, Louie Sanchez, 31, also pleaded guilty Thursday to felony mayhem and was sentenced to eight years in prison.
In exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped other felony charges.
Prosecutors say the two men attacked Bryan Stow in the Dodgers' stadium parking lot after the opening day game on March 31, 2011, when the team played the San Francisco Giants.
Stow is a Giants fan.
Stow, a paramedic from Santa Cruz, California, went into a coma as a result of the beating and, after returning to consciousness, is still struggling with a severe brain injury.
Stow, now 45, is disabled and unable to care for himself, his father, David, told the court Thursday.
Stow is also a father of two.
Norwood faces a charge of being a felon in possession of firearms, and the charge relates to firearms that authorities allegedly found in Norwood's home in Rialto, California, during their investigation into Stow's beating, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles and to an FBI affidavit.
Sanchez also faces the same federal charge, said Thom Mrozek, spokesman for federal prosecutors in Los Angeles.
