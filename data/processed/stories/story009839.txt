A California golf coach honored "for developing a wealth of exciting and educational golf programs to juniors" appears in court Wednesday on charges of molesting young students.
Livermore, California, police arrested Andy Nisbet last month, a day before he was to receive Northern California PGA's 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award, according to a police statement.
Nisbet, 31, allegedly "sexually assaulted multiple male children between the ages of 12 and 17 years old" while working as the PGA golf pro coaching children at the Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore, a police statement said. "The investigation so far has revealed that the sexual abuse occurred in Livermore between 2009 and 2012."
The Northern California PGA announced last October that on December 8 it would honor Nisbet: "PGA Professional Andy Nisbet of Las Positas Golf Course/GRIP Junior Golf Academy in Livermore, Calif., the 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award for developing a wealth of exciting and educational golf programs to juniors."
"Nisbet was a highly regarded Junior Golf Coach who coached many children in junior golf tournaments throughout the State of California, as well as nationally," the police statement said. "LPD detectives discovered that Nisbet coached children in Michigan, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama." He began working at the Livermore course in 2006, it said.
Detectives arrested Nisbet, a Livermore resident, on 65 counts on December 7, according to the police statement. The charges included oral copulation by force, lewd and lascivious acts with a child, distribution or exhibition of lewd material to a minor and meeting with a minor for the purpose of engaging in lewd and lascivious behavior.
