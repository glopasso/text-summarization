England beat India by a crushing 319 run margin with a day to spare in the second test at Trent Bridge to take a 2-0 lead in the four-test series.
Tim Bresnan was the hero, taking five wickets after hitting a brutal 90 to set India a near-impossible target of 478 runs to win the match.
The fourth day started with England in a commanding position, having turned the test on its head.
At one stage India had reduced England to 128-8 during the first innings, but it was the home side that went on to dominate the next two days with both bat and ball.
Bresnan's quick-fire 90 in the morning session helped England reach a huge second innings total of 544 runs. And with such a big score to chase India needed to start well, which they failed to do.
Bresnan dropped India's opening batsman Abinhav Makund first ball, but it didn't mark a change in fortunes for the visitors. After tea they had slumped to 129-8 when Harbhajan Singh, whose 46 was one of the few bright spots of the Indian innings, was caught off Bresnan.  But it was down to man-of-the-match Stuart Broad to bowl Sreesanth for the final wicket.
After two emphatic victories England will be confident of becoming the best test side in the world, a position currently held by their opponents.   England will overtake India if they win the third test at Edgbaston next week.
