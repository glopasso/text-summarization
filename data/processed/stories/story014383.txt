Imagine the size of the box this one came in -- a Lego tower stretching 36 meters into the sky above the Hungarian capital Budapest.
The 34.76- meter (114 feet) tower, which was completed on Sunday, has been certified as the world's tallest toy brick structure by Guinness World Records.
It beat the previous record holder, a 34.4-meter structure constructed last year with the help of U.S. students from a school in Delaware.
A spokesman for Guinness World Records confirmed that the tower qualified as the "tallest structure built with interlocking plastic bricks."
He said the record was officially registered to Lego Store Budapest on May 25.
The Budapest tower, topped by a Rubik's cube -- a Hungarian invention -- was also built with the help of Hungarian primary school children, according to local news websites.
The structure, built in front of the city's St. Stephen's Basilica, used hundreds of thousands of blocks.
