NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman plans to return to North Korea in August, CNN affiliate KXJB reported Monday.
Rodman, who recently visited the communist nation, said he plans to vacation with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
"I don't condone what he does, but he's my friend," Rodman told KXJB while in Fargo, North Dakota, for a promotional appearance.
Rodman, who was giddy throughout the interview, insisted the North Korean leader doesn't want war.

A spokesman for Rodman said Kim extended the offer during Rodman's visit a few weeks ago.
Rodman and Kim sat next to each other February 28, watching an unusual basketball exhibition in Pyongyang, North Korea.
The visit came at a time of heightened tension between the United States and North Korea, a result of Pyongyang's pursuit of a nuclear program.

Kim has made it clear that his country's nuclear test in February signals a new phase of confrontation with the United States, which Pyongyang has described as "the sworn enemy of the Korean people."
On Monday, the North Korean military scrapped the Korean War armistice agreement, according to Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party.

Kim is known to be a big basketball fan and one of his favorite players was Chicago Bulls legend, and Rodman teammate, Michael Jordan.
Rodman, 51, was one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, ranking 11th all-time in average rebounds per game.
The defensive star helped the Detroit Pistons and Bulls win five NBA championships.
The flamboyant Rodman frequently dyed his hair (sometimes many colors), sported multiple tattoos and facial piercings. One of his autobiographies is "I Should Be Dead By Now."
