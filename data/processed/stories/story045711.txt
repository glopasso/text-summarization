Jennifer Love Hewitt knows how to keep a secret.
The 34-year-old actress appears to have quietly married her "Client List" co-star Brian Hallisay, 35, ahead of their first child's arrival on Wednesday.
A rep for Hewitt told CNN in a statement that the star and Hallisay - who is refered to as "her husband" - are "thrilled to announce the birth of their daughter, Autumn James Hallisay," but didn't mention anything about a wedding date.
Hewitt and Hallisay first revealed that they were expecting a baby and planned to get married in June. At the time, the pair said that they were "looking forward to starting our family together," and Hewitt has been outspoken about embracing motherhood.
"I lost my mom a little less than a year and a half ago to cancer," Hewitt told People magazine in September.
"Obviously, I got very lucky that even though I lost my mother, I lost her later in life, but it still had a profound effect on me. I've always wanted to be a mom. I had a great relationship with mine. I'm ready to pass on to my child all the great love that my mom had for me."
CNN's Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.
