China's passion for Transformer robots might not follow computer logic, but it's no secret.
The stories are geek legends -- from repairmen building 20 giant autobots out of junk in a small village in Shandong to the true romantic who spent 10 months building an eight-meter-high Optimus Prime to propose to his girlfriend.
Then there was the reality series that picked four Chinese actors for minor roles in the upcoming "Transformers 4: Age of Extinction," a good part of which is supposed to take place in China.
It makes sense, therefore, that the Transformers 30th Anniversary Expo is being held in Macau this week.
Running June 1 to October 5 at the Venetian Macao, the new Transformers Expo showcases more than a thousand toys and collectibles in 10 different zones of the resort's giant event space.
Features include a replica of AllSpark (we're told it's the soul of a Transformer) and a laser grid to test visitors' sense of balance.
There's also a 3D hologram and a seven-meter-tall likeness of Autobots leader Optimus Prime.
A large number of the exhibits have been lent to the Expo by two "super collectors" from Hong Kong and Shanghai.
For anyone hoping to build up their own battalion of robots in disguise, the Expo seems like a good place to start.
Anniversary keepsake figurines of Optimus Prime, Grimlock, Starscream, Soundwave and Bumblebee have been produced just for the exhibition and are being sold on site.
Those who want all five will have to keep coming back -- a different figurine is being sold every month.
