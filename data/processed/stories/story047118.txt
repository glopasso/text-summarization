A man suspected of conspiring with a terrorist network responsible for the deaths of five U.S. soldiers in Iraq was arrested Wednesday in Canada, according to a statement from the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York.
Faruq Khalil Muhammad, 38, is charged with conspiring to kill Americans abroad and providing material support to a terrorist network that conducted suicide bombings in Iraq, the statement said.
He was arrested by authorities after a U.S. warrant was issued for his arrest.
The five U.S. soldiers were killed on April 10, 2009, when a Tunisian man drove a truck filled with explosives to the gate of a U.S. forward operating base in Mosul, Iraq.
The trucks' detonation destroyed a vehicle in a nearby U.S. convoy, killing Sgt. Gary L. Woods, 24; Sgt. 1st. Class Bryan E. Hall, 32; Sgt. Edward W. Forrest Jr., 25; Cpl. Jason G. Pautsch, 20; and Pvt. Bryce E. Gaultier, 22, the statement said.
Muhammed is suspected of providing material support for that attack and allegedly sought to conduct attacks himself and become a suicide bomber, the statement said.
"There is no safe harbor for terrorists, including those who endeavor to spread violence from halfway across the world," said U.S. Attorney Loretta E. Lynch in the statement. "Today's arrest demonstrates that we have not forgotten that sacrifice (of U.S. soldiers) and will continue to use every available means to bring to justice all those who are responsible."
It was not immediately clear whether Muhammed had obtained legal representation.
The Justice Department said it would seek to have Muhammed extradited to the United States for trial.
If convicted, Muhammed faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, the statement said.
