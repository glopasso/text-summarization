Wolfsburg striker Edin Dzeko expects to play for AC Milan next season.
The Bosnian international, whose 26 goals last season inspired the Wolves to the Bundesliga title, has already informed his club he intends to move to the San Siro outfit.
"I recently spoke to Wolfsburg executives about it and they know that I would like a transfer next summer," Dzeko told Gazzetta dello Sport. "The story with AC Milan is not over."
Dzeko was strongly linked with the Rossoneri last summer but despite AC Milan holding talks with the Bundesliga side, Wolfsburg refused to sell their top player.
The 23-year-old, who also attracted interest from Manchester United, insists his dream is to play with the Serie A giants.
"Manchester United have also shown an interest but I have been a fan of Milan since I was a child, when I watched their games on TV. It's for that reason that I really hope I can play next season there."
Dzeko is under contract with the German side until June 2013.
