Private pools, flat-screen TVs, mega liquor bottles.
Been there, seen it, drunk that.
Hotel amenities these days are as much a ploy to get you to gush about them to your friends back home as they are to make your stay comfortable.
This list of over-the-top hotel amenities is worth bringing up because each is a rare one-off, not available in all sizes.
1. Choice of 20 Fender guitars
Who needs an in-room iPod, when one of 20 Fender guitars is available for free at Chicago's Hard Rock Hotel?
Although guests do have to put down a credit card (in case they start to channel Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing antics), they can keep their chosen ax bedside until such time as they either take their band on the road or check out.
Choices range from a $1,600 Stratocaster to classic Telecasters and bass guitars.
Also available are floor amps and Nixon headphones that will vprevent renditions of "Freebird" from rocking out other guests.
Those that don't know a "G" chord from a "C," can tune into a streamed 70-minute lesson from guitar instructor Rico Monaco.
The hotel now offers a similar program for DJ mixers in addition to guitars.

2. Royal chariot
Taking inspiration from the historic British concession where it's located, The Ritz-Carlton, Tianjin is built to resemble an ancient British palace.
And what European palace is complete without a horse-drawn carriage and uniformed horseman?
Branding itself as a wedding hotel, the Ritz offers an extravagant "royal wedding package" that includes a Rolls Royce grand entrance, free-flowing Champagne tower, royal-themed cake and a ride on the carriage.
Non wedding guests can enjoy a 30-minute ride on the carriage around the former British concession too - for the princely sum of RMB50,000 ($8100).

3. Pet psychologist
They're said to be mankind's best friend -- and don't we treat them like it.

Dog expert Stanley Coren can answer questions about canine emotions and intelligence.
The service is available at these Provenance hotels: Hotel Max (Seattle), Hotel deLuxe (Portland, Oregon), Hotel Murano (Tacoma, Washington), Hotel Lucia (Portland) and Hotel Preston (Nashville, Tennessee).

5. Sleep concierge
After paying all this money for essentially a place to sleep, why not get some guidance on how to do it right?
The Benjamin has been a pioneer in the trend with an in-house sleep consultant, Rebecca Robbins.
The sleep team and Robbins, co-author of the book "Sleep for Success!," provide advice to adults and children.
Kid-size bathrobes and pillows, storybooks and dolls are available. Kids are then rewarded with a certificate for sleeping well.

Every couple that checks into Namale Resort and Spa on Fiji's Vanua Levu island is "kidnapped" at some point during their stay and taken to a surprise four-course picnic somewhere on the lush resort's 212 hectares.
Sometimes it's next to a waterfall, sometimes in a cave, sometimes on a private deck overlooking a blowhole in the Koro Sea. Guests never know when they will be summoned.

8. Pet goldfish
Forced to leave Rover behind? No worries. At Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants, guests can request a stand-in pet.
The Kimpton's in-room goldfish can't sit or fetch, but they can, if scientific studies are to be believed, calm nerves, reduce anxiety and lower blood pressure.
And if that doesn't work, Kimpton also offers in-room yoga lessons.

9. Chocolate parlor
Move over, Willy Wonka. Soneva Kiri's over-the-top chocolate parlor serves non-stop free chocolate from mousses and fondues to candies, lattes and brioche.
Who even knew there was such a thing as vinegar chocolate or citrus and thyme chocolate?
A team of sweet-toothed chefs oversees the handcrafted, Fair Trade chocolate that makes its way to this resort on the Thai island of Kood.

14. Fragrance butler
Take this, airport security enforcers.
At Vancouver's tiny Hotel Georgia and some other Rosewood's city hotels, there's no need to monitor perfume bottles to make sure they're less than 100 milliliters because there's no need to even pack them.
A white-gloved fragrance butler bearing 10 fragrances (five for him and five for her) on a silver salver will knock on your door within minutes of you notifying the concierge your wrists need spritzing.
Some selections can only be found in a specific hotel, for example Hermes Eau des Mervailles at The Carlyle in New York or Guerlain L'Instant de Guerlain at Rosewood Sand Hill in California.
Participating hotels include The Carlyle (New York City), Rosewood Crescent Hotel (Dallas, Texas), Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek (Dallas, Texas), Rosewood Sand Hill (Menlo Park, California), Rosewood Hotel Georgia (Vancouver), Al Faisaliah Hotel (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) and Rosewood Corniche (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia)
