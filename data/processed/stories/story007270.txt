It's been more than a week since Brown University student Sunil Tripathi was last seen, but authorities appear to be no closer to knowing where he is.
They are scouring Providence, Rhode Island, and nearby cities for any sign of the missing 22-year-old man.
Tripathi was on approved leave from the Ivy League school, meaning that he had requested and was granted time off, but he remained a student there.
"We miss his warm smile and generous gentle spirit so very much. Your help and prayers to find him mean so much," his family said in a statement.
Tripathi was last seen in the campus area on the morning of March 16. He was wearing blue jeans, a black Eastern Mountain Sports ski jacket, glasses, and a Philadelphia Eagles wool hat. He is about 6 feet tall, 130 pounds and has short dark hair.
According to his family, the FBI is assisting in the investigation, which is being led by the Providence Police Department.
Detective Mark Sacco told CNN that police have have no solid leads so far.
Tripathi apparently left his apartment without his wallet and cell phone. As far as police know, he was alone.
Tripathi grew up in Radnor, Pennsylvania. His family said he is a talented saxophonist and a philosophy major. He has been living in Providence since 2008.
A public Facebook page has been created to help find Tripathi. Updates on the search effort are being posted there, as well as photographs and messages of encouragement.
"Our concerns are first and foremost with Sunil and his family," said Margaret Klawunn, vice president for student life and campus services at Brown University. "We are hopeful that by encouraging the Brown community to help spread the word that Sunil will be located."
