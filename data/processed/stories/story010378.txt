A New Hampshire teenager accused of killing a woman and severely injuring her daughter during a brutal home invasion was found guilty Tuesday of first degree murder and attempted murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
Steven Spader sat emotionless as the verdict was read in the trial for the gruesome murder of Kimberly Cates in Mont Vernon, New Hampshire, last year.
Spader, 19, was convicted of breaking into Cates' home and hacking her to death with a machete, while his friend, 19-year-old Christopher Gribble, repeatedly stabbed her 11-year-old daughter Jaimie as she tried to defend her mother.
"I could go on for days about the depth of your depravity," said Judge Gillian Abramson. "It is sufficient to say, you belong in a cage."
A medical examiner determined Cates, a 42-year-old nurse, had died from "multiple sharp injuries to the head, torso, left arm, and left leg." The victim's daughter sustained serious knife injuries that required hours of surgery.
Cates' husband, who was away on business at the time of the attack, addressed the court in a prepared statement.
"Kim and I had dreams, hopes, aspirations... now shattered," he said. "With one phone call on a Sunday morning, all those dreams were lost."
His daughter, Jaimie, did not testify.
Three co-defendants brokered plea deals, pleading guilty to associated charges while testifying against Spader.
Gribble is expected to stand trial in February.
