Rafael Nadal reversed the trend of big name exits in the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, but the Spaniard had to fight back from dropping the opening set before edging past Argentine David Nalbandian on Sunday.
Nadal, who was given a first round bye, recovered from losing an opening tie-break to defeat his opponent 6-7 6-2 6-2, setting-up a fourth round showdown with compatriot David Ferrer.
Speaking to the official ATP Tour Web site, Nadal said: "When you go on court against a player with his talent, you are always a little bit scared what will happen.
"I think having a long first set was better for me than for him. I felt he was a little bit more tired than me. He started to make more mistakes, and it was a little bit easier for me to play.
Sixth seed Andy Roddick is also safely through -- with the home favorite in spectacular form as he crushed Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine 6-2 6-1 in just 55 minutes.
Eighth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France beat Germany's Philipp Kohlschreiber 6-2 7-5 and he next faces 12th seed Juan Carlos Ferrero for a quarterfinal place.
Second seed Novak Djokovic and defending champion Andy Murray are among the big names to have already departed the event.
Meanwhile, in the women's draw, Kim Clijsters -- who is only seeded 14th for the event -- crushed 17th-seed Shahar Peer 6-0 6-1 in just 51 minutes.
The Belgian was joined in the next round by compatriot and wildcard Justine Henin, although the former world number one was made to battle a bit harder before edging past Dominika Cibulkova 6-4 6-4.
Second seed Caroline Wozniacki is also through, although the Dane had to fight back from a dismal opening set to defeat Maria Kirilenko 1-6 6-1 6-4, while seventh seed Jelena Jankovic was another women's seed to progress.
