Nature's beauty seems so much closer from the seat of a saddle.
Bikes offer a more intimate connection with the people of the places you pass through.
No wonder adventure motorcycling has grown massively in the last decade.
The 2004 "Long Way Round" and 2007's "Long Way Down" TV documentary series (both featured Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman's round the world rides) helped spark the trend.
In 2011, the Motorcycle Industry Council reported that sales of adventure touring bikes were up 14.2% across 12 major brands.
There are hundreds of scenic roads worldwide, but the greatest rides are spiced by the thrill of twisties and smooth hardtop where motorcyclists can crank open the throttle.
Here are 10 of the best rides worldwide, whether for a day out or a longer adventure.
All are in places where motorcycles can be rented or where tours are organized.
