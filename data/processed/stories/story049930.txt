Though the attacks have been relatively rare and the bombings in Boston on Monday were shocking, Americans are not total strangers to terror attacks at home.
Here is a list of the terror attacks on U.S. soil since 1980 that involved casualties:
1978-1995: Three people die and 23 others are wounded after a string of mail bombings carried out by Ted Kaczynski.
"The Unabomber," as he is also known, is serving eight life sentences for murder. He was not charged with terrorism, but the string of bombings is considered to be a terror case.
February 26, 1993: A bomb explodes on the second subterranean level of Vista International Hotel's public parking garage, below the 2 World Trade Center building. Six people are killed, and more than 1,000 people are treated for injuries.
Six suspects were convicted of participating in the bombing. The seventh suspect, Abdul Rahman Yasin, is still at large.
April 19, 1995: A bomb rips through the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring almost 700 injured.
Timothy McVeigh is convicted on federal murder charges and executed in 2001.
July 27, 1996: A bomb explodes in Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta during the middle of a concert during the Summer Olympics. One person is killed, another dies from a heart attack, and 111 others are injured.
Bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph is arrested in North Carolina in 2003, after being indicted in 2000 for the Atlanta bombing and for other bombings, including one at an abortion clinic where one person died.
Rudolph is serving four consecutive sentences of life in prison plus 120 years for the attacks.
September 11, 2001: Nineteen al Qaeda members hijack four U.S. passenger airliners. Two are flown into the Twin Towers in New York, one crashes into the Pentagon and another crashes into the Pennsylvania countryside after passengers attempt to wrest control of the aircraft to prevent an attack on the U.S. Capitol.
The death toll is staggering: 2,753 people are killed at the World Trade Center site; 184 at the Pentagon; and 40 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. A total of 2,977 people are killed.
November 5, 2009: Major Nidal Hassan goes on a shooting rampage at a military processing center at Fort Hood, Texas, killing 13 and wounding 32.
Hassan is on trial for the shooting deaths. Hassan has not been charged with terrorism, but the rampage is considered by many to be a terror incident.
