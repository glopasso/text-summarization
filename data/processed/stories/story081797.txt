There was a major shock on the second day of the Royal Ascot meeting when Irish horse So You Think, rated as one of the bankers of the week, was turned over in the feature Group One Prince of Wales's Stakes.
Tuesday's opening day of England's premier Flat racing fixture saw the top three-year-old, Frankel, justify his odds-on favoritsm with an impresive win in the St James's Palace Stakes -- and So You Think was expected to follow suit at odds of 4-11.
However, the five-year-old, hyped up by his usually reserved trainer Aidan O'Brien as one of the best horses he has ever trained, was caught on the line at the end of the 1.25 mile contest by 17-2 chance Rewilding, given a superb driving ride by charismatic Italian jockey Frankie Dettori.

Dettori told reporters: "I have to say the second never gave up. It was a tremendous gallop between two great horses -- and when I got past him it was sheer joy."
Meanwhile, O'Brien believed he had made a mistake in his horse's preparation, saying: "I will take responsibility for this defeat personally.
"After he won his first two races so easily I had gone easy on him. I think it was a trainer error," he added.
"I didn't have him fit enough for this kind of race and he's given a good blow afterwards. I would think there's improvement to come."
Wednesday proved a disastrous day for the punters, with bookmakers coming out on top. Not one winning favorite triumphed, with two 11-1 shots and two 12-1 chances coming out on top.
