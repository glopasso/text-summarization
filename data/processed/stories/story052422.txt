A bomb blast in the northern Nigerian city of Kano killed at least four people late Sunday, according to local police.
The blast occurred at a busy intersection in a predominantly Christian area of the city and left several cars burning, Kano police spokesman Rabilu Ringim told CNN.
Police cordoned off the area and were searching for suspects and any additional bombs.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack, the spokesman said.
Terrorism in Nigeria has been in the global spotlight recently since more than 200 school girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram.
The terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on April 14 from a boarding school in Chibok in northeastern Nigeria. Dozens escaped, but more than 200 girls are still missing.
