Five Rwandans accused of involvement in genocide in their native country were arrested in Britain on Thursday, London's Metropolitan Police Service said.
The men appeared in a London court under an extradition warrant alleging offenses that include genocide and murder between 1993-1994.
They were identified by police as Vincent Bajinya, Charles Munyaneza, Emmanuel Nteziryayo, Celestin Ugirashebuja and Celestin Mutabaruka.
At least 800,000 people were killed in Rwanda's 1994 genocide.
The victims were mostly from the Tutsi ethnic minority, who were targeted by Hutus over a rivalry that dates to colonial days. Some moderates from the Hutu majority who supported Tutsis also were killed.
The five men are expected to appear again in the same court on Wednesday.
