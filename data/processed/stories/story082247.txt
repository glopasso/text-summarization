Classic rockers Van Halen on Thursday abruptly postponed more than 30 tour dates, following their June 26 concert in New Orleans.
Contacted Friday for comment, a representative for the tour said that no other information was available. No explanation was given, and there was no word on when the appearances might be made up.
Thirteen shows, including Saturday's concert in St. Paul, Minnesota, will go on as scheduled.
The band is on tour in support of its new album, "A Different Kind of Truth" -- the first complete album with original lead singer David Lee Roth since the platinum-selling "1984," which was released on the last day of 1983.
Van Halen, which formed in 1974, has a turbulent history.
Roth left the band in 1985 after a falling-out with guitarist/founder Eddie Van Halen and was replaced by vocalist Sammy Hagar, who was with the band until 1996. Former Extreme vocalist Gary Cherone joined the band for 1998's "Van Halen III" -- the worst-selling album of the band's career.
At different times, Eddie Van Halen has undergone treatment for alcoholism and cancer.
The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007 and later that year announced a reunion tour with Roth again fronting the band. The band also has replaced original bassist Michael Anthony with Van Halen's son, Wolfgang. Several shows during the 2007-08 tour were also postponed, but ultimately rescheduled.
According to the Recording Industry Association of America, Van Halen has sold more than 56 million albums.
Van Halen forums on the Web lit up with the news, with some fretting the shows would never happen.
"This isn't good," said a fan who goes by the handle bsbll4 on vhlinks.com, which bills itself as "Your Van Halen Internet resource guide."
ED-A-HOLIC posted, "there is a BIG difference between CANCELLED and POSTPONED, I just hope it's not Eddie having to battle against cancer again."
