The daughter of actor Billy Bob Thornton was found guilty of manslaughter in the death of an infant Wednesday, but a Florida jury acquitted her on murder and child-abuse charges, a court spokeswoman said.
Amanda Brumfield, 32, was accused in the October 2008 death of 1-year-old Olivia Madison Garcia, who she was babysitting when the child fell and suffered fatal injuries.  Her trial ended Wednesday in Orlando, Florida, according to court spokesman Karen Connolly Levey.
Thornton released a statement through his publicist a year ago when Brumfield was charged.
The actor is estranged from his daughter "and has had no contact with her for quite some time," publicist Arnold Robinson said.
"When informed about this situation, he (Thornton) commented that, 'Anytime a baby's life is lost is an unimaginable tragedy and my heart goes out to the baby's family and loved ones,' " Robinson told CNN in a written statement.
CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.
