Inter Milan did all they could to keep the pressure up on Serie A leaders AC Milan as they beat lowly Cesena 2-1. But they left it very late.
Two goals in injury time by striker Giampaolo Pazzini ensured Inter stay in touch with their city rivals, closing the gap to five points until Sunday at least, when Milan host mid-table Bologna.
Cesena took the lead after 56 minutes thanks to Croatian striker Igor Budan and, as the finals minutes ticked down, looked to have claimed three vital points.
But then Inter's unlikely comeback started with Samuel Eto'o delivering an inswinging cross into the box which Pazzini managed to poke home on the volley.
Seconds later the Italian striker found himself in the right place at the right time again as he rose to meet Maicon's cross from the right to head home to complete a dramatic and bizarre turnaround.
"It was all calculated, it was organized from the first minute, everything went perfectly," Inter coach, Leonardo joked afterwards, AFP reported.
"We looked at it as a decisive game and it was very important to get the three points for the Champions League, even if qualification isn't yet secured. Winning in this way really is incredible even if it's not our first comeback," he added, AFP reported.
The loss leaves Cesena in 16th place, although both Sampdoria (who face Brescia) and Lecce (who travel to Chievo) can both overtake them if they win on Sunday.
In Saturday's other game third-placed Napoli kept up the pressure on Inter with a 1-0 win over Genoa -- Slovak midfielder Marek Hamsik with the goal seven minutes before the final whistle.
The result means Napoli remain a point behind Inter in the table whilst extending their lead over fourth-placed Lazio who host Juventus on Monday evening.
