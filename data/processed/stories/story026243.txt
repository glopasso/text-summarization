Want to get your career off to a flying start or shift up a gear? What are your your plans and resolutions for 2013?
This year, Leading Women has been profiling inspirational women who have reached the very top in their fields, whether it's in business, humanitarian work, politics, arts or sport.
But research from the American Association of University Women shows that full-time working women are still earning 23% less than men, and Catalyst 2012 Census of Fortune 500 tells us that women held only 16.6% of board seats in 2012, the seventh consecutive year of no growth.
So, how can women change this?
Career advisers tell women to be more forward in asking for promotions, pay rises and extra responsibility; to find a mentor; to join a networking group and to accept praise more readily.
Will these steps help overhaul your career in 2013? Or do you have a different way of achieving your goals?
