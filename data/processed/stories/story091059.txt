It might be time to rename the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards as MTV's Beyonce Awards.
The singer, who leads this year's group of nominees with eight nods, will also perform during the show and receive the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. (Somewhere, Kanye West is nodding his approval.)

The Vanguard award is given to "exemplary musicians who have made an incredible and long-lasting impact on pop culture," according to MTV. In the past, the honor's been handed to celebrated artists like Madonna, the Beastie Boys and Justin Timberlake, who received the Vanguard award in 2013.

"Not many singers have the power or ability to command such a massive legion of fans, drop a number one album out of literally nowhere and take the world by storm tour after tour," MTV said in a statement. "Beyonce has proved time and time again that she is the standard to which all other performers must measure up."
Queen Bey will bring her "***Flawless" standards to the stage when the MTV Video Music Awards airs on August 24 at 9 p.m. ET. Other performers include Usher, Ariana Grande and Maroon 5.
