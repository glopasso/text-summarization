You watched the royal wedding. You admired Catherine's dress.
Now, you have a chance to get close to it.
The Duchess of Cambridge's widely acclaimed ivory and white satin-gazar dress, designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen, goes on display at Buckingham Palace next month, according to the Royal Collection press office.
Tourists will be able to view the dress, as well as the royal wedding cake, during the annual Summer Opening, which runs from July 23 through October 3.
The 1977 Rolls-Royce Phantom VI in which the Duchess of Cambridge traveled to Westminster Abbey, and the 1902 State Landau carriage used by The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to travel along the processional route to Buckingham Palace, are already on public display at the palace, the Royal Collection says.
Prince William and Duchess Catherine will set up their own temporary London home this summer as well, just a few miles away, at Kensington Palace, according to Clarence House, the office of Prince Charles and his family.
William and Catherine will move to Kensington at some point in June or July, royal sources tell CNN. The sources won't say which home on the palace grounds the couple is moving into, but it is not William's childhood home there. The couple is considering alternatives for a more permanent home for when they visit London, Clarence House said.
The couple will retain their main home on the Welsh island of Anglesey, and their offices at St. James Palace, Clarence House said.
