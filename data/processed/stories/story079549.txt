Rafael Nadal warmed up for next week's Indian Wells hard-court tournament by thrashing David Ferrer in the final of the Mexican Open at Acapulco Sunday.
The former World No.1 claimed his 52nd ATP title, his 38th on clay, by seeing off his fellow Spaniard 6-0 6-2.
Since his return from a seven month absence with a knee injury in February, Nadal has won 12 of his 13 matches, coming second in Vina del Mar, Chile, before winning at Sao Paulo last month.

"I have had some difficult months, especially during my time away from tennis," the 11-time grand slam winner told reporters.
"But I take with me fond memories of returning to Acapulco. I feel good being back on court.
"I have to thank my family and everyone involved in my rehabilitation. It has been a difficult time over the last few months.
"My heart tells me I should continue competing, that I need to move on to the next tournament."
