Ruth Robinson Duccini, who played one of the Munchkins in the 1939 classic "The Wizard of Oz," has died.
She was 95 and died Thursday in Las Vegas.
Her death was confirmed by Ted Bulthaup, a representative for Duccini.
"She went into hospice about a week ago and I have been awaiting this news," said Bulthaup.
Duccini was the last female Munchkin. Her death leaves just one more Munchkin member of the "Oz" cast, Jerry Maren, now 93.
Flowers were placed on the Munchkins' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Friday in remembrance of Duccini.
