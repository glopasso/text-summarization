"The Walking Dead's" midseason finale on Sunday - watched by a staggering 14.8 million viewers - was about as intense as it gets.
There was Abraham's army returning to the church in just the nick of time and Rick putting down a cop who wouldn't stop running.
Beth pushed yet another cop, the threatening O'Donnell, down an elevator, and Morgan found his way back to the church just as our group of survivors left it.
But all of that action paled in comparison to the big, heartbreaking exchange at Grady Memorial Hospital (and if you went to the show's official Facebook or Instagram right afterward, you know what happened).
Carol and Beth had finally been reunited with their people when Dawn demanded that Rick return her former ward, Noah.
Rick objected, but Noah decided to go back. And then it happened: One of Dawn's comments set Beth off, leading to an altercation that ended with Dawn shooting Beth in the head.
It was a shocking, tragic end for a beloved character.
The look on Daryl's face as he carried Beth's body, followed by the anguish on her sister Maggie's face, said it all. One year after we saw the death of patriarch Hershel, the Greene family had lost someone else.
Viewers struggled to come to terms with the character's death on Twitter.
"If Daryl cries, you know it was a bad night on #WalkingDead. #RIPBeth," said Travis Radina.
Christopher Cross didn't know how he was going to get through the work day after that death.
Megan Mobley was "Still crying because Walking Dead."
Ken Jeong of "The Hangover" and "Community" summed it all up with "Crying."
So what can we expect next? Unfortunately, fans will have to mull over this episode for a while, as "The Walking Dead" doesn't return to AMC until February.
What did you think of the finale?
