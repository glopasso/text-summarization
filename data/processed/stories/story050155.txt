A comic book chronicling the life of Prince Harry of Wales will be released in late August, publishers announced Thursday.
"It's time to focus our attention on the Wild Child, Prince Harry. ... Prince William might be the one getting married, but Prince Harry continues to make waves all over the world," publisher Bluewater Productions said.
"The Royals: Prince Harry" will join the graphic novel series dedicated to Harry's brother William and his wife, Kate Middleton. "The Royals: Prince William and Kate Middleton" was released in April to coincide with the royal wedding.
"As Americans, we are fascinated by the British royals. They fit within our construct of a celebrity-fueled popular culture. But more than that, they represent an air of pomp and history that we just don't have," author C.W. Cooke said.
Cooke has written comics for multiple series including "Female Force," which features the life stories of "strong women in politics" such as U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, according to the company's website.
"The Royals: Prince Harry," featuring art by Justin Currie, will be available at comic retailers August 24. The standard comic will cost $3.99, but a collector's graphic novel will also be available online for $7.99, according to the statement.
