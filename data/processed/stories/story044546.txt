Turkish police have identified the man suspected of killing American tourist Sarai Sierra, whose body was found earlier this month, CNN affiliate CNN Turk reported Thursday.
Police are now looking for the suspect, identified only as "Ziya T.," in the southern province of Hatay, where he has family, CNN Turk reported.
Police distributed a picture of him at all border checkpoints in case he tries to leave the country.
Sierra, a mother and amateur photographer from Staten Island, New York, went missing January 22 while on a solo trip. Her body was found February 2 near ancient stone walls in Istanbul, according to the semi-official Anatolian news agency.
Police suspect the 33-year-old was killed at a different location than where she was found.
Sierra went to Turkey on January 7 and was due to return home January 22.
Earlier this month, CNN Turk reported police detained a Turkish man with whom Sierra was in contact.
Authorities collected DNA samples from 21 people, including three foreigners. It was not immediately known whether "Ziya T." was among them.
