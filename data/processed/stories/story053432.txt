Police say they are investigating the disappearance of more than $400,000 worth of jewelry from a photo shoot involving Lindsay Lohan in London on June 6.
Jewels are missing from an Elle magazine photo shoot of Lindsay Lohan.
"Items of jewelry went missing from an Elle photoshoot ... and the matter is now being investigated by the police," the fashion magazine said in a statement to CNN. "Elle has no reason to believe that Lindsay Lohan was in any way responsible and has no further comment to make."
Lohan's representative told CNN the actress was "happy to cooperate," and that "No one has contacted Lindsay" about the investigation.
The magazine would not say whether the 22-year-old actress wore the jewelry in the photo shoot, and could not say when the photos would be published.
"The theft was reported to a central London police station on 8 June 2009 after earrings and a necklace, believed to be diamond and estimated to be worth in the region of £250,000 [$410,000], were found to be missing approximately two days earlier," London's Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
No arrests have been made, the police said.
Big Sky Studios in London, where the shoot took place, refused to comment.
CNN's Nicola Goulding, Max Foster, Laura Perez Maestro and Jonathan Wald contributed to this report.
