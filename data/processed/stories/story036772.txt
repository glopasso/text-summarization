If you've ever turned on VH1 (or at least passed by it while channel surfing to something with sharks), there's a 200% chance that you've seen the network's "I Love The ... " series, which also means that you've stumbled upon comedian Hal Sparks waxing nostalgic on everything from Nerf footballs to the R. Kelly sex tape. ("I Love the 70's" and "I Love the New Millennium," respectively.)
As a regular contributor to the series, it seems as though Hal pretty much loved every decade, and everyone seemed to love Hal. In fact, in 1999 the budding comedian received his big break on TV when the E! network pegged him to host "Talk Soup," a show that aired the best clips from the previous day's daily talk shows (read: people getting naked on "Springer").
Sparks says, "I learned a lot more about the audience -- the Romanesque problem we have as a culture right now. 'Jerry Springer' is just kind of the chubby, redneck version of throwing Christians to the lions."
Shortly after taking over "Talk Soup," Sparks landed a role on the Showtime series "Queer as Folk" and numerous other parts on various networks. Basically, the guy started to show up just about everywhere, including big-screen appearances in "Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star," "Spider-Man 2" and as the cult leader Zoltan in "Dude, Where's My Car?"
(Zoltan: "Soon we will leave this lame planet and fly through outer space with cool aliens who like us!")
But if you haven't seen him on TV or in film, there's also a chance you've seen him on stage, singing and playing guitar for the band Zero 1. Or, perhaps, he beat you up in a kung fu fight.
(Seriously, Hal has a lot of hobbies.)
A firm believer in the personal benefits of martial arts, Sparks says, "If you take anything I say with any seriousness whatsoever, go study Yang style tai chi. It will make you live longer."
Apparently, the fountain of youth isn't bacon.
