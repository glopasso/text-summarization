Sir Elton John faces surgery soon for appendicitis that has derailed his European tour, a spokesman for the singer said Tuesday.
John, 66, was diagnosed with "appendix abscess surrounding retrocaecal appendicitis" after falling ill during the tour, publicist Gary Farrow said in a written statement.
The surgery will be performed in the United Kingdom in "the coming weeks" after he undergoes an intensive course of antibiotics and "doctors can be confident they have sufficiently reduced toxins within the inflamed appendicitis site," Farrow said.
The remaining shows in his tour have been canceled, including Friday's headline show at London's Hyde Park, he said. The concert will still happen with Ray Davies, Elvis Costello, Gabrielle Aplin and Nick Lowe performing.
"Elton is incredibly disappointed to postpone these tour dates," he said. "To know that he made such super-human efforts and continued to perform to thousands through his illness only confirms his dedication to his European fans. He is eager to be back on top form and return to play the remaining shows starting in early September 2013."
Touring will resume only after "he has fully recovered from both the planned surgery and any damage caused by the appendix abscess," the statement said.
