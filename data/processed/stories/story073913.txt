The Royal Dutch Air Force scrambled fighter jets on Monday to intercept a cargo plane that entered Dutch airspace without proper clearance as world leaders gathered in the Netherlands for a nuclear security summit.
The LAN Cargo Boeing 777 bound for Amsterdam from Miami "was diverted away" from Dutch airspace due to restrictions around the summit in The Hague, Edmund Messchaert, spokesman for the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice, told CNN.
Messchaert said Dutch F16 fighters followed protocol and escorted the plane to Germany without incident.
He said LAN Cargo apparently forgot to apply for permission to land or didn't know airspace restrictions were in place for the summit.
A statement from the hauler, based in Chile, confirmed Flight UC 1503 wasn't able to land in Amsterdam and was diverted to Frankfurt "because of an error in the special classification of the flight."
The plane was later permitted to continue to Amsterdam, the airline said.
