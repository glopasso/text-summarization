Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel will serve a half-game suspension for an "inadvertent violation regarding the signing of certain autographs," the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the university said Wednesday.
In a statement, the groups said there is no evidence that Manziel, who made history last year as the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy, received money in exchange for autographs.
In addition to serving his suspension, Manziel will address the team about lessons learned, and Texas A&M will revise its education concerning student-athlete autographs.
"Student-athletes are often asked for autographs from fans, but unfortunately, some individuals' sole motivation in seeking an autograph is for resale," NCAA Vice President of Academic and Membership Affairs Kevin Lennon said in the statement.
"It is important that schools are cognizant and educate student-athletes about situations in which there is a strong likelihood that the autograph seeker plans to resell the items."
