Heidi Klum knows that modeling is a young woman's game. In the latest issue of InStyle magazine, the supermodel claims that models, like food, spoil after a certain age.
"Models have a sell-by date," the 36-year old Klum said in the interview.
The mother of four -- who recently changed her last name to Samuel for her husband, the singer known as "Seal" -- also said that there are certain jobs she just doesn't do anymore.
"Like the young, sexy, cute things for teenagers, or even 25-year-old girls. I go in a different bracket now," Klum said.

The German-born model entered a different bracket of current and former models in 2004 when she became an entrepreneur with the television series "Project Runway." Klum signed on as host, judge and executive producer of the reality show, in which up-and-coming fashion designers compete for the chance to receive money to launch their own fashion line.
In 2009 Forbes magazine estimated Klum's income at $16 million.
The new season of "Project Runway" kicks off Season 7 on Lifetime network on Thursday. In March Klum and fellow judge designer Michael Kors will be starring in their own "Project Runway" video game, in which players can design fashion lines, choose their models, strut down the catwalk, and strike a pose in a photo shoot.
InStyle's February issue hits newsstands on Friday, January 15.
