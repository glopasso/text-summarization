Someone called police with a report of an armed man at actor Russell Brand's Hollywood home Monday, but it turned out to be a "fraudulent call," Los Angeles police told CNN.
There was no emergency, Officer Sara Faden said. She did not know whether Brand was home during the 3:35 p.m. incident.
"We sent a number of officers from our Hollywood division. The officers saw no crime or anyone with a need for medical attention," Detective Gus Villanueva said.
There have been several such "swatting" incidents targeting celebrity homes in Los Angeles in the past year. Other victims include Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber.
Brand, 38, starred in the movies "Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and "Get Him to the Greek" and was married for about two years to pop star Katy Perry.
CNN's Alan Duke, Tresha Lindo and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.
