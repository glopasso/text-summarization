Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor was rushed again to the hospital late Saturday, her family said.
The ailing actress was taken from her home to UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center, her daughter Francesca Hilton said. She did not provide details.
Gabor has suffered major health problems in the last year, including hip replacement surgery and a leg amputation. She has been unable to walk since a 2002 car accident.
The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is famous for her many marriages and strong personality as well as her acting prowess.
Her more prominent films include John Huston's Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge," in 1952, "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953, "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 cult classic, "Touch of Evil."
