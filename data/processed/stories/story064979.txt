U.S. President Barack Obama and Pakistani President Asif Zardari met at the White House on Friday.
Their discussion focused on fighting terrorism and "the importance of cooperating toward a peaceful and stable outcome in Afghanistan," the White House said in a statement.
"The President underscored the importance of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship and our continued support for Pakistan," it said.
Zardari is in Washington to attend a memorial service Friday for diplomat Richard Holbrooke, who was Obama's envoy in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Holbrooke died last month.
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden huddled with Zardari on Wednesday in Islamabad during his unannounced visit to the region. Biden also met with Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and senior military officials.
