A fire broke out at a Rihanna concert in Dallas on Friday night, forcing the event to end early.
A video posted on YouTube shows a fire burning at the top of the stage at the American Airlines Center, with some sparks falling toward the floor. Some people begin to stream out.
The R&B and pop star posted several messages on Twitter following the incident.
"DALLAS!!! We set the stage on FYAH tonight!!! LITERALLY!!! I'm so (mad), I was havin so much fun wit yall too!!! I gotta come back man!!" the singer tweeted.
CNN affiliate KTVT, citing attendees at the concert, said the fire apparently started from pyrotechnics that were part of the show.
Dallas Fire-Rescue Captain Johnny Bates said a chair caught on fire, KTVT reported.
"One of our engine crews did enter the building but crew members with the AAC or concert put out the initial fire," Bates said, according to KTVT. He added that there were no injuries.
