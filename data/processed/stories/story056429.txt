Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes might have made an inspired choice when naming their baby girl.
According to numerous reports, the secretive couple chose to name their new arrival Esmeralda Amada Gosling. TMZ, which first obtained the baby's birth certificate, points out that Amada is also the name of a character Mendes played in 2007's "We Own the Night."
Throughout her pregnancy, both Gosling and Mendes have been beyond quiet about their new status as parents. When Ellen DeGeneres brought up the rumors of a pregnancy with Mendes in February, the actress brushed off the reports as "ridiculous."

"It all started because I didn't want to go through the scanners at the airport," Mendes explained, noting that's not unusual for her.
And yet in September, several reports indicated that Mendes and Gosling had indeed welcomed a baby.
"She's absolutely in heaven being a mom. She's never been happier," one friend of Mendes told People magazine after the baby's arrival. "She and Ryan are just in awe of this beautiful person they created. It's a really special time for them."
