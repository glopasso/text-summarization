American Webb Simpson has spoken about his delight at securing his first PGA Tour victory at the Wyndham Championship in his native North Carolina.
Simpson, who caddied for his compatriot Neal Lancaster at a Pro-Am event ahead of the Greensboro tournament when he was a teenager, finished on 18-under-par, three-shots clear of fellow-American George McNeill.
"I really couldn't think of a better place to win than here in Greensboro," the 26-year-old told the PGA Tour's official web site.
Simpson carded a bogey-free final round to seal his triumph and move into third position in the standings for the season-ending Fedex Cup.
"That was probably the most fun 18 holes I've ever been a part of," he said of Sunday's round.
"When I made the putt on 15, I asked my caddie for the first time all day, `Where do we stand?' and he said, `We're two ahead right now.'
"I knew I needed to play solid golf on the last three holes, and to birdie 16 was so huge. ... I knew I had a three-shot lead on 18, and as soon as I hit the ball in play, I knew it was probably over."
McNeill's final round of 64 was only enough to get him to 15-under, but the 35-year-old was satisfied with his form during the competition.
"I can only control myself," McNeill said. "I can't control what everybody else does. I'm very happy with the way I hit it, the way I played, the way I putted."
Former world number one and three-time major winner Vijah Singh finished in a five-way tie for fourth position, one-shot behind American Tommy Gainey on 14-under.
Level with Singh were U.S. duo Jerry Kelly and Charles Howell III, South Korea's Kyung-tae Kim and Carl Pettersson of Sweden.
Jim Furyk, ranked 26 in the world, finished alongside Colombian Camilo Villegas and Chez Reavie in ninth place on 12-under-par.
