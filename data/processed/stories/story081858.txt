Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher is "flawed," according to ex-Formula One star Stirling Moss, who claimed the German will not be in the hunt for motor racing's biggest prize in 2011.
Schumacher returned to F1 this year with the new Mercedes team, having retired in late 2006, but the 41-year-old struggled to make an impact as he finished the season in a disappointing ninth place.
Moss, 81, wrote off Schumacher's chances of winning an eighth world title, and stated the former Ferrari racer's previous triumphs devalued the achievement of becoming world champion.
"He's flawed, we've seen that all over the place," Moss told reporters at the British Racing Drivers' Club's (BRDC) annual awards.
"The fact he is carrying on next year is interesting, although quite frankly, I wouldn't be worried if I was up against him, The fact he was a seven-time world champion ruins what being a world champion is all about."
The BRDC vice-president, who never won the drivers' championship in his 10-year racing career as he finished runner-up four times in a row, also cast aspersions on Schumacher's success.
"We've never seen him at his best when he had a really good driver alongside him. We've never seen him with a driver of similar talent," the Englishman said.
Schumacher has expressed his determination to improve next season, and said the whole Mercedes team is focused on winning in 2011.
"There is really only one goal, and that's winning," the former Benetton driver told Swiss newspaper Blick.
"We are extremely motivated to come into a position to be able to win, that is the basic requirement [for next season]. I said already at the start [of 2010] that I don't want to drive around in the midfield."
