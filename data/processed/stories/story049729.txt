Arsonists started a huge December 8 blaze that destroyed a downtown apartment building under construction and damaged nearby buildings, the Los Angeles Fire Department said Thursday in a news release.
"The fire at 900 West Temple Street destroyed the seven-story complex under construction, damaged a nearby high-rise structures and the Harbor (110) Freeway," the release said. "Investigators recovered sufficient evidence to eliminate all known potential accidental causes and determine the fire was intentionally set.
"The fire caused an estimated $20 million to $30 million in damage to the DaVinci Apartments. Total damage estimates to nearby businesses and Caltrans property remain undetermined at this time."
Nobody was hurt in the fire that shut down traffic on the 110 and 101 freeways. The blaze started in the early morning hours and lit up the Los Angeles skyline.
The Fire Department said it seeks information about two "potential witnesses" seen in video footage. They are called "persons of interest" and are not considered suspects, the release said.
Security camera video of the two witnesses can be viewed at the Fire Department website.
The fire was battled by 250 firefighters. The fire was investigated by the Los Angeles Fire Department and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
"The work at the crime scene is finished; however, our investigation is not over," said ATF Special Agent in Charge Carlos A. Canino in the release. "ATF will continue to work together with our state and local partners to investigate this crime and bring those responsible to justice."
