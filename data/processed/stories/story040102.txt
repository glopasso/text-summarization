An 11-year-old Israeli girl is being treated for severe burns after a Molotov cocktail was hurled into the car she was riding in Thursday in a West Bank settlement community, national EMS provider Magen David Adom said.
The incident took place at around 6 p.m. in Ma'ale Shomron, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces confirmed.
The girl's father was also in the car -- which had Israeli license plates -- but he was able to escape the vehicle with only minor burns, according to the paramedic service. Their names have not been released. Both were transported to a hospital.
The spokesperson said the IDF was still searching the area for the attacker Thursday evening.
