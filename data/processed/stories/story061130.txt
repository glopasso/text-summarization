An Indian freelance journalist working for an Iranian news outlet has been arrested in connection with the bombing of an Israeli embassy car in New Delhi last month, authorities said Wednesday.
The suspect has been identified as Syed Mohammad Kazmi and is being held on charges of plotting the attack, according to Ashok Chand, deputy commissioner of police.
A court remanded Kazmi, 50, in police custody for questioning, Chand told CNN.
Authorities did not say which Iranian media organization Kazmi allegedly worked for.
The device attached to the Israeli vehicle wounded several people when it exploded. The same day, another device was found on an Israeli Embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia, and safety detonated. A day later, a series of bombs went off in Bangkok, Thailand.
Israel has alleged that the Iran is behind the attacks, an accusation that Tehran denies.
