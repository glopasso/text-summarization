(EW.com) -- If there's one thing that TV Land sitcoms are known for besides their old-school laughs, it's their genius stunt casting of television faves.
EW has exclusively learned that Fran Drescher's show "Happily Divorced" has just booked two TV greats -- Rosie O'Donnell and Dan Akyroyd -- to appear on separate episodes slated for the end of May.
O'Donnell will play Katie O'Grady, an old high school friend of Fran (Drescher) and Judi (Tichina Arnold) who arrives to help Fran learn a lesson about her relationship with her overbearing mother Dori (Rita Moreno). Meanwhile, Akyroyd plays a potential love interest -- described as "charming and successful" -- that Fran's ex Peter (John Michael Higgins) sets up for her.
"Happily Divorced" is currently airing its second season on Wednesday at 10:30 p.m. and will wrap its current batch of episodes on June 6.
