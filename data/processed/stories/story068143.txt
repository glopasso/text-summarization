An American Airlines Boeing 757 made an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport an hour after taking off because the crew smelled smoke in the cockpit, a fire department official said.
Inflatable chutes extend from a jet that made an emergency landing Tuesday in Los Angeles.
American Airlines spokesman John Hotard said there was evidence of smoke in the cabin, but he could not say if it was visible or just an odor.
Flight 31 was headed from Los Angeles to Honolulu, Hawaii. There were 188 passengers and seven crew members aboard.
When it landed, the pilot ordered an emergency evacuation. Passengers evacuated by inflatable slides.  Watch passengers slide down chutes »
"It was split-second, 'Go, go, go. Don't take any bags with you. Just go, get off,' " said passenger Julie Brown. "And we just walked to the exit door, and there's that huge slide."
Five passengers had minor cuts and bruises, Hotard said.
Hotard said the flight was the first of the day for the aircraft, and there were no reports of problems with it in the past 30 days.
The pilot requested an emergency landing as a precaution, Hotard said.  Watch as official tells what happened »
