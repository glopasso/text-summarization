United Nations inspectors are heading to Iran Sunday to visit a uranium mine in Yazd and a uranium-thickening plant in Ardakan, Iran's semi-official Fars news agency reported. It's the seventh such trip in recent months.
The inspection comes as a May 15 deadline looms for Iran to meet international requirements regarding its nuclear program. Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency agreed in February on seven measures Tehran must take, as the United States, France, Russia, Germany, China, and the United Kingdom hope to broker a final agreement with Iran on May 13 in Vienna, Austria.
Behrouz Kamalvandi, Iran's atomic department spokesman, says his country has already taken six of those steps, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported Sunday.
Many countries and international entities have expressed concern about Iran using its nuclear program to built atomic weaponry. Iran has said it just wants to create nuclear power plants for civilian energy.
