It's a bromance we never saw coming: Paul Simon and Sting will embark on a tour of North America together early next year.
The two, who spilled the news to The New York Times ahead of Tuesday's official announcement, show plenty of chemistry in the article, teasing each other and fondly recalling their first gig together, at a fundraiser this spring for the Robin Hood Foundation. "After we finished [the set]," Simon tells the Times, "we both looked at each other and said: 'Wow. That's pretty interesting.' "
"Paul Simon and Sting: On Stage Together" will kick off in February, and feature the two playing their hits in combination and on their own. Tickets go on sale a week from Tuesday.
