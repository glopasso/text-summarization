The couple who called police after being held hostage in Big Bear, California, by rogue ex-Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner will get a majority of the $1 million reward for information that led authorities to him.
Karen Reynolds and her husband, Jim, called 911 on February 12 to report that Dorner had tied them up and stolen their car.
They will receive 80% of the reward, put up by the city of Los Angeles with help from other jurisdictions, groups, and private donors.
A panel of three judges awarded 15% to the Daniel McGowan, who discovered Dorner's burning truck near the ski resort town, and 5% to R. Lee McDaniel, who spotted Dorner on February 7 and informed police.
The panel said nine other people who filed claims were not entitled to any reward money.
The manhunt for Dorner ended when Dorner was cornered and died in the San Bernardino Mountains, about 100 miles east of the city where he once had been a police officer.
The 33-year-old former Navy officer holed up in a cabin after a shootout with law enforcement.
The renegade cop killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life.
