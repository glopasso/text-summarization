Portugal have confirmed that captain Cristiano Ronaldo will not be fit for the World Cup playoffs against Bosnia-Herzegovina, thus ending a growing club-versus-country row.
The Portuguese Football Federation had insisted that the world's most expensive player travel home to be assessed, despite his Spanish club Real Madrid insisting that he could not play due to his ongoing ankle problems.
Coach Carlos Queiroz had selected the forward in his squad for Saturday's match in Lisbon and the return leg in Zenica four days later despite the objections of the Spanish club.
Real at first refused to release the 24-year-old, having sent him to see Dutch specialist Niek van Dijk, but relented on Tuesday to allow the Portuguese medics to make their own verdict.
"After clinical evaluation and imaging, it was concluded that the player is not physically able to integrate the preparation stage of the national team for these games," read a statement on the Portuguese FF's Web site on Tuesday night.
"The Portuguese Football Federation wish the player a good and quick recovery."
Ronaldo has been sidelined since October 10, when he aggravated an ankle problem playing for Portugal in a qualifier that he had suffered on club duty the previous month.
Real do not expect him to be fit for at least another two weeks, but Portugal had hoped he could help them qualify for the 2010 World Cup finals in South Africa.
Queiroz defended his decision to make Ronaldo travel home to be assessed.
"Based on the rules and principles governing clubs and associations, we have put Cristiano in the squad," he said.
"I was coach of Real. The club deserves respect. I know the medical team, president and CE,. I have every respect for that club. This fact cannot compel me to put any club below or above the others. All clubs and players deserve equal treatment."
