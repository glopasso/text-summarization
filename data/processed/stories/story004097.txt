Former England cricket star Chris Lewis was remanded in custody by a British court Tuesday, charged with attempting to smuggle drugs through an airport.
Chris Lewis joined Surrey to play in Twenty20 matches for the 2008 season.
The 40-year-old all-rounder, who played 32 Tests and 53 one-day internationals for England in the 1990s, was arrested Monday when border officials at London's Gatwick Airport found cocaine hidden in luggage that had arrived on a flight from the Caribbean island of St. Lucia.
Four kilograms of cocaine with a street value of around $350,000 was seized by the UK Border Agency, the UK's Press Association said. The drugs were in a liquid form hidden in fruit tins, officials said.
Lewis and basketball player Chad Kirnon, 26, both from London, were held and questioned by Customs officials and later charged.
British Revenue & Customs spokesman Bob Gaiger told PA: "This was an excellent detection by UK Border Agency officers.
"HMRC, together with UKBA, play a vital role in the fight to prevent illegal drugs from entering the UK and in protecting our communities from the violence and corruption that always accompany this hideous trade."
The two men made a brief appearance at Crawley Magistrates' Court in West Sussex on Tuesday afternoon, where Lewis had a bail application refused, PA reported.
They were remanded in custody to appear via video link in court next Wednesday.
