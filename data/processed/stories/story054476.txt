Two snowmobilers died Wednesday in an avalanche on Logan Peak north of Salt Lake City, Utah, a sheriff's department official said.
Two people died after being trapped on Utah's Logan Peak during an avalanche.
Lt. Matt Bilodeau of the Cache County Sheriff's Office told CNN that someone using a satellite phone called at 10:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET) and told authorities about the incident.
"Two people were trapped," he said. "They have both been recovered."
The body of only one of them, a male, had been taken down the mountain, he said. Logan Peak's summit is at an altitude of 9,710 feet.
Though the area is not off limits to snowmobilers, they had been warned of the danger after a recent snowstorm.
"The media's been putting that in the paper, on the radio and on TV," Bilodeau said.
"We are still in extreme avalanche danger," he said, and he urged snowmobilers to "take into account they need to stay in probably the areas that have less of a slope to them."
CNN's Scott Spoerry, who grew up in the area, said a recent avalanche knocked out the water supply for the city of Logan's 47,000 residents.
"Every year, there's a few avalanches," he said.
The area is also popular during the summer, when hang gliders launch themselves from the peak.
