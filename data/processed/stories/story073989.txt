The presidents of the two Sudans concluded talks Sunday aimed at addressing outstanding economic, oil and security issues after tensions between the two nations nearly led to a return to war.
Talks between Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and his South Sudan counterpart Salva Kiir concluded in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, where the two agreed to temporary arrangements over a disputed oil-rich region claimed by both countries.
The agreement called for the creation of temporary administrative and security arrangements for the Abyei region, including the creation of a police service and a limited governing council.
Al-Bashir and Kiir agreed to reconvene another summit to discuss the final disposition of the disputed region.
Sudan and South Sudan in 2013: Rise or fall together
South Sudan split from Sudan in 2011 as part of a peace deal that ended decades of war between the two sides. The war left nearly 2 million people dead.
Soon after the split, tensions between the old foes escalated over outstanding issues, coming close to an all-out war in April.
South Sudan shut off its oil supply last year, accusing Sudan of stealing oil revenue. The South got about 70% of the formerly united country's reserves when it became independent last year.
Both countries have seen hyperinflation and a squeeze on incoming foreign currency as a result of the shutdown.

In September, the leaders signed a deal to resume the nation's oil operations, but failed to address other key disputes between the recently divorced countries.
In addition to a deal to restart oil exports from South Sudan, the two presidents agreed on a demilitarized zone and principles of border demarcation. However, they failed at that meeting to reach a deal on the status of Abyei.
Neither country implemented the agreements from that meeting.
