Veteran American Paul Goydos has become just the fourth player in PGA Tour history to break the 60-shot barrier after carding a remarkable 12-under-par 59 in the opening round of the John Deere Classic on Thursday.
Goydos follows in the footsteps of Al Geiberger (1977), Chip Beck (1991) and David Duval (1999) after his 12-birdie blitz at the TPC Deer Run, Silvis, Illinois.
However, Goydos, who at 46 is the oldest player to achieve the feat, is the only one of the quartet to break the barrier on a par-71.
The Californian closed out the back nine in just 28 shots, with eight birdies in nine holes, while he took just 22 putts all day.
Michael Letzig and Australian Matt Jones head the chasing pack after carding seven-under-par 64s, with Letzig also keeping a bogey off his card.
Japan's Ryo Ishikawa is the only player to shoot a round of 68, which he achieved in the final round of The Crowns on his home tour on May 2.
Meanwhile, Irishman Darren Clarke leads the field after the opening round of the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond.
The former Ryder Cup player carded a six-under-par 65 to hold a narrow advantage over Graeme Storm, Damien McGrane and Edoardo Molinari in the traditional British Open warm-up.
The 40-year-old Clarke has still not secured a place in the St Andrews field next week and he told reporters: "This is the first round and there's an awful long way to go, but of course I would love to qualify."
A further seven players, including American John Daly, are a further stroke behind, while world number two Phil Mickelson is off the pace after an opening round level par 71.
