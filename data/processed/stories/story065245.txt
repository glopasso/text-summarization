A tour bus accident in southwest Tibet left at least 44 people dead, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported via Twitter Saturday. Xinhua cited a spokesman with the regional government.
The bus was involved in a three-vehicle pileup along the National Highway in Nyemo County in Tibet, according to Xinhua. It crashed against a sports utility vehicle and a pickup truck, and then plunged into the valley. Photos showed the wrecked bus resting upside down by a riverbank.
Photos also showed emergency personnel and rescue workers carrying passengers from the scene in stretchers. Dozens of pieces of luggage were piled to the side of the retaining wall.
