The Scottish Football Association (SFA) has demanded an apology from their Brazilian counterparts after allegations of racism marred a friendly between the two countries.
Brazil striker Neymar scored twice in the game held at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium in London on Sunday but accused Scottish fans of racism after he was booed.
A banana was also thrown onto the pitch but police confirmed it was thrown by a German tourist in the crowd and said they were satisfied there was no racial element to it.

But Scottish fans were appalled that Neymar suggested after the match he was booed because of his color, stating they had jeered the striker due to his constant playacting.
Now Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan wants a formal apology from Brazil saying they were "dismayed" by the claims.
He said in a statement on the SFA website: "It is very disappointing that this episode threatened to overshadow an entertaining match, played amidst a real carnival atmosphere created by supporters of both teams.
"Scotland and Brazil have played many times over the years, each time in a colorful and friendly environment, and we feel that it's necessary to draw a line under Sunday's events.
"Scotland's supporters were genuinely upset and annoyed that the unfounded allegations leveled against them threatened to sully their reputation as fair, good humored and respectful spectators.
"As the matter has been resolved, and Scotland supporters cleared of any involvement, we felt it was only right that we acted on behalf of our supporters to request an apology either from the player involved, or the Brazilian FA."
