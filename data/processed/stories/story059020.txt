Stacy Lewis of the United States conjured up a dream finish on the Old Course at St Andrews Sunday to capture the Women's British Open title.
Lewis birdied the famous Road Hole 17th then repeated the feat on the 18th to win by two shots from South Korean pair Choi Na Yeon and Park Hee Young.
Lewis, who was claiming her second major after taking the Kraft Nabisco Championship in 2011, carded a final round level-par 72 for eight-under 280.
South Korea's Park Inbee, bidding for a historic fourth major of the year, struggled again in the blustery conditions and closed with a six-over 78 to finish tied for 42nd.
The 25-year-old from Seoul admitted that she had struggled with the pressure of expectation.
"I've gone through four rounds of intense pressure and I'm sort of glad it is over," said the World No.1.
"I almost feel relieved it is all over. It was hard being the center of attention all week and I feel exhausted."
Lewis, who won all five of her matches at St Andrews in 2008 as part of the winning American team in the amateur Curtis Cup, could scarcely take in her victory.
"This is unbelievable," said Lewis. "I fought so hard over every shot all day and then it happened so fast at the end. A couple of birdies and it was over."
She had trailed Choi by three at the turn, but mastered the conditions coming home.
Her approach shot to five-feet at the 17th, "probably the best shot of my career" proved the key to victory, followed by a 30-feet birdie putt at the last to seal the triumph.
Fellow American Morgan Pressel led after the third round, completed Sunday morning after high winds caused play to be abandoned early the day before.
Pressel closed with a 76 to finish tied for fourth on five under with Norway's Suzann Pettersen (74).
