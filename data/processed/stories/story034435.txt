(EW.com ) -- When "American Idol" season 12 premiered lower in the ratings than last year, that was to be expected — returning weaker has been the show's trend for several years.
When "Idol" numbers dipped after the show moved from auditions to the Hollywood rounds, that was also to be expected too — the reality veteran's ratings tend to sag during the middle portion of its run every year.
But "Idol" is dropping nearly every week and last night was down 50 percent from its Thursday night premiere this season ... and that's scary.

Thursday's "Idol" fell another 7 percent down to 11.7 million viewers and a 2.8 rating among adults 18-49. Again: a 2.8 rating. For the first time ever, ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" topped "Idol" in these early numbers. Hell, "Scandal" nearly tied "Idol!"
Here's "Idol's" Wednesday night track in the demo since its debut this season: 6.0, 5.5, 5.5, 4.6, 4.3, 4.1, 3.9, 3.8, 3.8, 3.6. While Thursday's trend has been: 5.6, 5.2, 4.5, 4.1, 3.7, 3.9, 3.8, 3.6, 3.1 and then last night's preliminary 2.8, down 33 percent from last year's airing this week. The only time the show's ratings have gone up this season was the week after Valentine's Day (which is a traditionally soft night for TV viewing).
EW: NBC's 'Leno' plan, some ask why
Elsewhere on the grid: ABC's regular-folks version of "Wife Swap" was up from its last season premiere. "Grey's" was up 12 percent. A special "1600 Penn" at 8:30 was softer than "Parks and Recreation" in the slot. CW's "Vampire Diaries" perked up a tenth for last night's punk rock episode.
