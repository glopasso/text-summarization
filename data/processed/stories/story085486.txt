President Barack Obama firmly laid out his plan Thursday to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIS, the terrorist organization that now controls large swaths of Iraq and Syria.
But what did the American public think of the speech?
CNN's Tom Foreman broke down the results of Microsoft's "Bing Pulse," where viewers reacted online in real time to the President's address.
Overall, Americans gave the President's speech high marks, but party lines bled through as Democrats had a consistently more favorable perception throughout the speech.
And independents stuck closely to Republicans during the 15-minute address.
But all viewers rallied around one point in the speech:
"ISIL is a terrorist organization -- pure and simple -- and it has no vision other than the slaughter of all who stand in its way. In a region that has known so much bloodshed, these terrorists are unique in their brutality," Obama said.
And the lowest point in the President's speech came when he announced he was deploying an additional 475 U.S. military advisers to Iraq.
It seems the President's assurances that U.S. forces will not "have a combat mission" and the U.S. would not get "dragged into another combat war in Iraq" didn't make the troop buildup any more palatable.
