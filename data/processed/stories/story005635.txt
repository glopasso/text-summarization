The mother of a 15-year-old girl who appeared on "The Tyra Show" as a self-described sex addict is suing the daytime talk show host for up to $3 million, claiming the show flew the girl, Jewel Ciera Washington, to New York and put her on TV without parental consent or the proper work papers required by the state of Georgia.
"It's like I'm trapped in a dark place with no light shining down, like I'm a prisoner," Washington said on the TV show. "I know that I need help for this. ... I know it for a fact," she added.
The lawsuit, filed October 8 in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, Georgia, by Beverly McClendon, says written consent and an employment certificate must be obtained before a minor can be "employed as a performer in a television production ... [and] the minor will not be used for pornographic purposes."
According to McClendon's attorneys, Wanda Jackson and George Lawson, "the sole intent of the Defendants programming was to increase ratings in order to gain advertising revenue."
McClendon's attorneys claim "both Plaintiffs [McClendon and Washington] have been harmed and have received injury ... to their health and well-being " as a result of the alleged violations and alleged negligence by the TV show host and program, its executive producers and Warner Bros. Entertainment.
Washington appeared on the now-defunct program in October 2009.
Scott Rowe, senior vice president of worldwide communications for Warner Bros. Television Group, told CNN Entertainment that the company is "not commenting at this time." Calls to McClendon and her lawyers have not been returned.
The defendants have not answered the complaint. No court date has been set.
Warner Bros. Entertainment, one of the defendants in McClendon's lawsuit, is a division of Time Warner, which is the parent company of CNN and "In Session," which airs on truTV.
In Session's Jessica Thill and HLN's Kaylin Rocco contributed to this report.
