Get ready for more "Arrested Development."
Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer of Netflix, told USA Today that he's "positive" about another season of the Emmy-winning sitcom.
It's "just a matter of when," he said.
Why can't you stop watching Netflix?
After three seasons on Fox in the mid-'00s -- including one in which it won the Emmy for best comedy series -- "Arrested's" fourth season premiered on Netflix on May 26, 2013. Since then, there's also been discussion of an "Arrested Development" movie, but nothing has come of it so far.
Sarandos said he agreed with criticism that the cast didn't appear together enough during the fourth season, and organizing cast members' schedules is key to the success of a fifth season.
He also told USA Today about other plans, including "Marco Polo," a series due later this year; a sitcom starring Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin, "Grace and Frankie," coming in 2015; and the Wachowskis' show about telepaths, "Sense8."
Also due next year: new seasons of "House of Cards" and "Orange Is the New Black."
Thanks largely to "Cards" and "Orange," Netflix is up for 31 Emmys this year.
