An explosion caused by a chemical reaction at a University of Maryland-College Park chemistry lab caused minor injuries to two students and forced authorities to evacuate the four-story building, according to the Prince George's Fire Department.
Initial reports described an explosion and fire inside the building, but fire department spokesman Mark Brady said in a post to the department's Twitter account that there was no fire. The department's hazardous materials team was preparing to go into the building, he said.
Two students were being treated at the scene for first-degree chemical burns and superficial cuts, Brady said on the social networking service.
