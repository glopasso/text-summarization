Paris St Germain have completed the signing of Barcelona's Brazilian left-back Maxwell on a three-and-a-half year contract for an undisclosed fee.
The 30-year-old finalized his move on Thursday after passing a medical and agreeing personal terms with the big-spending French league leaders.
Maxwell, who has never made a full international appearance for his country, joined Barcelona from Inter Milan in July 2009, and played 57 La Liga matches for the club without scoring a goal.

In his two full seasons with the Catalan giants, Maxwell collected a remarkable 10 trophies; three Spanish Super Cups, two European Super Cups, two League titles, two Club World Cups and one Champions League.
However, he struggled to command a regular place in the Barcelona side, with compatriot Adriano and Frenchman Eric Abidal often selected ahead of him.
PSG sporting director Leonardo told reporters: "We're thrilled, he is a player I have always liked and who plays in the same position that I used to play in -- we have something in common."
Maxwell himself added: "The main motivation for me to come here was the interest that PSG showed in me. The ambition the club has for the future also persuaded me to join."
Paris St Germain, who appointed Italian Carlo Ancelotti as their new coach late last year and are boosted by funds from their cash-rich Qatari owners, are currently three points clear at the top of the French table.
