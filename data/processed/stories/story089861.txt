Two soldiers from Fort Bragg were arrested this week and face murder charges in the death of a North Carolina teenager, authorities said.
The soldiers, identified as Christopher Roger Blackett, 20, and Sebastian Gamez, 20, are accused of killing 17-year-old Vincent Edwin Carlisle Jr, said Harnett County Sheriff Larry Rollins.
Carlisle's body was found Thursday afternoon in the woods in the county, Rollins said.
The men also face charges of disposing of a corpse.
Carlisle, a high school senior, had been missing for four days, CNN affiliate WRAL reported.
The teen had just started a new high school and was excited about school, Melanie Stewart, his principal, told the affiliate.
"It's important to me that people know that Vincent Carlisle was a very intelligent young man, and he had dreams, and he had plans," Stewart said.
CNN's Samuel Gardner III contributed to this report.
