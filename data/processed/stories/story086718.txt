A man and woman suspected of kidnapping a 5-year-old boy from Missouri were arrested Tuesday afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona, an FBI spokesman said.
The boy -- Devon Denman -- was found unharmed Monday in the back seat of a stolen vehicle after a high-speed police pursuit in New Mexico ended with Elizabeth Denman and Mark Cochran fleeing when the vehicle's tires were punctured by police stop sticks, according to Lt. Eric Garcia of the New Mexico State Police.
Authorities had been searching a 200-mile area around Gallup, New Mexico, west of Albuquerque, for Elizabeth Denman, believed to be the boy's mother, and Cochran, a registered sex offender, Garcia said.
The couple were arrested Tuesday without incident at Indian Bend Wash Park in the Phoenix metro area at 12:50 p.m. (3:50 p.m. ET), according to Manuel Johnson, an FBI spokesman in Phoenix.
A handgun was also found at the scene of their arrest, Johnson said.
During Monday's car chase, several shots were fired at police, according to Garcia.
It was not immediately clear how Denman and Cochran traveled to Phoenix -- about 300 miles southwest of Gallup, Johnson said.
The couple are being held at the Maricopa County jail pending a court appearance, Johnson said.
