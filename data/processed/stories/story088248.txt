Barcelona defender Dani Alves has ended speculation about his future by signing a new contract with the Spanish Primera Liga champions.
The 27-year-old Brazilian international full-back, who had been linked with a move to big-spending Manchester City next season, has agreed a three-year extension to his current deal.
Alves -- who will officially sign his new deal on Wednesday -- is now contracted to Barcelona until June 30 2015.
Barcelona sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta told the club's official website:   "This is the news we were all hoping for, for both the club and the player.
"The negotiations were long but never tense and Alves' performances on the pitch have been as good as ever. We have taken our time and we can finally announce that we have achieved the objective we set out to achieve."
Zubizarreta continued: "He plays with an intensity that has nothing to do with tactics but is more about spirit.
"Alves has everything. We have looked at the market and there is nobody like him, he is unique in his position."
Alves, who is currently with the Brazil squad preparing for the friendly international against Scotland in London this weekend, moved to the Camp Nou from Spanish rivals Sevilla for 29.5 million euros in 2008 and is a key member of coach Pep Guardiola's side.
