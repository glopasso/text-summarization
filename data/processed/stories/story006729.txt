Things are starting to move along for the remake of Kathryn Bigelow's "Point Break" that was first announced in September 2011.
Alcon Entertainment announced Wednesday that Ericson Core will direct the project.
Core got his start in cinematography, serving as the director of photography for films like "The Fast and the Furious" and "Daredevil." His feature directorial debut was 2006 football film "Invincible," which starred Mark Wahlberg.

Core is taking on sports again with "Point Break," but the remake may not focus on surfing like the 1991 original.
According to a press release from Alcon, the new film "is set in the world of international extreme sports." An undercover FBI agent, like Keanu Reeves' character in Bigelow's film, will again infiltrate a ring of criminals.
Production on the "Point Break" remake is set to begin in late 2013.
