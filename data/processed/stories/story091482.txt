(Mashable)  -- Facebook is rolling out a new breed of Pages called Friendship Pages that pull together the public wall posts, comments, photos (based on tags) and events that two friends have in common.
The Friendship Pages feature was cooked up by Facebook software engineer Wayne Kao and then brought to life in an internal hackathon event.
The Pages are designed to the tell the story of two friends on Facebook through their shared activity.
"For those of us who have worked on it, the best part is the human side of these Pages. They can bring back memories, conversations and times spent together," explains Kao.
Friendship Pages are accessible from under the main photo on a friend's profile Page and via links from related wall posts or relationship stories.
The Pages are public to other members so long as they have permission to view both users' profiles.
Friendship Pages are said to be launching today, but are likely being delivered to members in a gradual rollout. We think the Pages are an interesting alternative way to organize Facebook activity around friends, though it does add another layer of complexity to the site.
