Top jockey Richard Hughes achieved the remarkable feat of seven winners from an eight-race card in a meeting at Windsor Monday.
Hughes, who is heading for the title of champion jockey for the most wins in a season, all but secured the honor for the first time with his remarkable display at the racecourse in the south of England.
He came close to going through the card -- only stopped from a clean sweep in the sixth race in which he finished third in a competitive handicap.
The odds on his feat were a massive 10,168 to 1, but British bookmakers reported that their losses were likely to be limited because betting volumes were low on a working day.
"It would also have been far worse had he rode seven winners on a busy Saturday.
"If we could choose a day for this to happen then Monday would be it," said a spokesman for a leading firm.
The 39-year-old Irishman is only the second jockey to achieve seven wins on the same day at a British meeting, the other was Frankie Dettori at Ascot in 1996.
He told broadcaster At the Races: "I'm over the moon -- it's great to do it. I always said I might do it one day at Windsor, my lucky track."
Hughes achieved the first two wins on mounts trained by his father-in-law Richard Hannon, who supplies him with many favorable rides.
"Without Richard Hannon I wouldn't be doing any of it," he added.
The record for most successive wins is 12, by the great Gordon Richards, who is the only jockey to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.
