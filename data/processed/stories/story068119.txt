After three years of searching, the remains of Holly Bobo have been found in Tennessee.
The 20-year-old nursing student was last seen alive in 2011. Hundreds of volunteers turned out to search for her, and her case yielded more than $450,000 in reward money offered.
Bobo's remains were found Sunday in Decatur County, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said Monday night.
CNN affiliate WREG reported that hunters had found a human skull.
District Attorney Matt Stowe said he is "ready, willing and able to seek the death penalty in this case."
"We are going to make sure that everyone who played a part in the heinous crime that has attacked the peace and dignity of the great state of Tennessee faces a consequence for that," Stowe said Monday night.
Two men have been charged in connection with Bobo's death: Jason Wayne Autry and Zachary Adams. Both have pleaded not guilty.
Bobo's brother has told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading Bobo away from their home in the town of Darden in April 2011. Volunteers from at least five counties searched for the student, but to no avail.
