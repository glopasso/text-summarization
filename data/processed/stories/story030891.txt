A pilot died Sunday when his small plane crashed at an air show at Travis Air Force Base in California, an official said.
Col. David Mott identified the deceased as 77-year-old Eddie Andreini. Andreini had been flying since he was 16 and had been performing at air shows for the past 25 years, Mott said.
He asked that anyone with video or photographs of the accident to please contact the base.
The crash of the civilian performer's aircraft happened during an acrobatic aerial maneuver at the Thunder Over Solano air show. The aircraft was upside down when it hit the ground, Mott said.
He added: "No one wants to see an event like this and certainly ... our hearts go out and our condolences go out to the Andreini family and his crew, who have been working together for many years."
The rest of the show was canceled, and the crash is under investigation.
A photograph from the scene showed black smoke rising from a tarmac. The crash happened away from spectators.
