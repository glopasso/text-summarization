(CNN)When the Avengers return to the big screen in May, expect destruction, superheroes coming to blows and lots of brooding.
Things don't seem to be working out so well for Iron Man, Captain America and the rest.
The much-anticipated sequel sees Ultron -- an artificial intelligence who turns on humanity -- and his forces laying waste to the world, with the Avengers not quite up to the task of stopping them.
The trailer has a lot of images that will be analyzed by Marvel Comics fans for the next few months (like who is that disrobing in the distance?).
Best of all, we get a better look at the brawl between the Hulk and Tony Stark's Hulkbuster.
Needless to say, "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" looks to be the movie to beat this summer, when it hits theaters on May 1.
