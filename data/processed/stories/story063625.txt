(CNN Student News) -- November 17, 2014
We're kicking off the week with news from Australia, Mexico, and the atmosphere over our heads. What exactly is an omega block, and how does it differ from a bomb cyclone or the polar vortex? What is the G20? We've got the answers in this Monday's show. We're also reporting on an AP U.S. History controversy involving both the College Board and some school boards across the country.
