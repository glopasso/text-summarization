An explosion took place on a road close to Kabul's international airport Wednesday morning, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force said. There were no ISAF casualties.
Initial information indicated that the blast may have been the work of a suicide bomber, ISAF said.
The Afghan interior ministry said the blast took place on Qasabah Road, which is situated to the north of Kabul International Airport.
Militants have targeted the airport previously. In June, Taliban fighters armed with guns and explosives were killed by security forces after taking over a building near the airport.
The Taliban said the attack was intended to target Americans in the international airport, one part of which is used by military forces and another by civilians.
