Score another win for the power of music -- and Bruno Mars gets the assist.
Medical personnel at a hospital in Cleveland, Ohio, are crediting the "Just the Way You Are" singer with helping the recovery of 11-year-old Zumyah Thorpe.
According to reports from CNN affiliate WKYC, Thorpe was severely injured in a March 2013 car accident that killed her pregnant mother and two sisters. Thorpe suffered horrific brain swelling that required the removal of part of her skull. While she recovered, nurses played songs by Mars every day.
"I asked her who her favorite singer was and she said 'Bruno Mars' as quick as anyone would say any singer," Nancy Bass, a pediatric neurologist at UH Rainbow Babies & Children's Hospital, told the station. "And she just started singing every single word. It definitely brought a tear to my eye."
"I am absolutely convinced that singing those Bruno Mars songs and being able to say 'Bruno Mars' is in itself a miracle, and knowing all the words to the songs has helped her recover," Bass said.
Mars himself was touched by the girl's recovery and his role. When he played Cleveland's Quicken Loans Arena Saturday night, he invited Thorpe to visit him and gave her a number of gifts, including his hat, a guitar and a tour jacket.
Mars also called attention to Thorpe's story on his social media accounts.
"Zumyah tonight you gave my band and I something we've never felt before. you're an inspiration to the world! #WeLoveYouZumyah," he posted.
Thorpe repaid the compliment.
"He means a lot to me, he put a lot of hope into my heart," she said. "If I want to be a dancer when I get older, I can. I can do whatever I want to accomplish, I can."
