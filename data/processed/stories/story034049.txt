Justin Bieber was one of many artists posting about the late entertainer's legacy.

While Wiz Khalifa wrote, "3 years ago today the world lost a legend. RIP Michael Jackson. Your music lives on for you. Thank you for everything!"
Jackson's death, on June 25, 2009, was caused by a combination of the anesthetic propofol and sedatives administered by Dr. Conrad Murray, according to the Los Angeles County coroner.
Murray has been in jail since he was sentenced to four years for involuntary manslaughter in November.
