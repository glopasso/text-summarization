A suspected mumps outbreak in New Jersey is linked to a Jersey shore nightclub, officials say.
The Monmouth County Health Department issued a statement on Thursday saying it is investigating 22 "probable cases" of the contagious disease that is spread through saliva.
Officials say 21 of those infected are adults who had recently been at D'Jais Bar & Grill in Belmar, a place that says on its website that it is "one of the Jersey shore's most talked about venues."
CNN was not able to reach D'Jais for comment on Thursday.
It was not immediately clear how the one sick person not connected to D'Jais -- a child -- became infected.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website that mumps "typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite."
After that, symptoms include salivary gland swelling. There is no cure or specific treatment for mumps.
The CDC says most people with mumps recover fully, although there can be complications.
