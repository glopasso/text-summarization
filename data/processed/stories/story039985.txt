Saving the Arabian Oryx
The Arabian Oryx has roamed the deserts of the Middle East for centuries, a symbol of endurance and an inspiration to the region's poets. In recent years however, over-hunting has seen Oryx numbers fall to near unsustainable levels. IME visits the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve to learn more about efforts to save the endangered animals.
Cedars Eco-tourism
High in the mountains of Lebanon grow the country's ancient cedar trees. Prized for their fragrant wood, they are considered a national symbol and feature prominently on the Lebanese flag. IME visits the Al Chouf Cedar Reserve to learn how local conservationists are using eco-tourism to preserve the much cherished trees.
Green Awareness in the Gulf?
The UAE entered into the green spotlight earlier this year when it was announced that Abu Dhabi would become the permanent hub for the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). But just how much do people in the oil rich Gulf state know about the environment? IME investigates.
Fast Food into fast fuel
A slick new initiative in the UAE is turning used cooking oil from French fries and chicken McNuggets into bio-diesel -- an organic fuel. A specially equipped factory gathers used oils from McDonald's kitchens and transforms them into a renewable fuel for the fast food restaurant's logistic trucks. IME tells the story of kitchens and carbon reductions.
