Margaret Pellegrini, one of the last surviving Munchkins from the original production of "The Wizard of Oz," died Wednesday, the Munchkins spokesman said. She was 89. 
Pellegrini played the flowerpot Munchkin and one of the sleepy head kids in the classic 1939 film, according to spokesman Ted Bulthaup.
She suffered a stroke at her home in Phoenix Monday, Bulthaup said.

Pellegrini's death leaves just two surviving Munchkins, including Lollipop Kid Jerry Maren, 93, who lives in Los Angeles, and Ruth Duccini, 95, who lives in Phoenix, Bulthaup said.
