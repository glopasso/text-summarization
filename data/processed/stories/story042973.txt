(CNN)Beyonce: What are you trying to tell us?
That's what the Internet is agonizing over after she posted a photo on Instagram of herself on Sunday.
The caption-less picture shows the "Flawless" pop diva on the beach, buried in sand. The pronounced piles of sand on her stomach and breasts led some of her Instagram followers to speculate that she was dropping pregnancy hints.
Either that, or Blue Ivy needs to work on her sandcastles.
The move is classic Beyonce, who has a history of game-ifying the message when it comes to personal announcements.
She revealed her first pregnancy at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards by stripping off her blazer at the end of her performance to show off her baby bump.
Since then, the Internet and entertainment media has been obsessed with searching for clues to her next pregnancy. Gawker published a lengthy post in December citing evidence that Beyonce has been pregnant for months.
Bottom line: We'll know for sure when Beyonce is ready for us to know.
