Park rangers have recovered the body of a Colorado man who fell to his death on the slopes of Wyoming's nearly 14,000-foot Grand Teton over the weekend, the National Park Service reported.
Edward Tom was looking for a campsite in a strong storm Friday evening when he fell nearly 100 feet, according to the Park Service. Two physicians were in the area and rappelled down to him, but attempts to revive him failed, it said.
Tom, 40, of Boulder, Colorado, was at a backcountry camping site known as Petzold Caves when the storm hit, bringing heavy wind and hail. He and a climbing partner planned to spend the night there before climbing the 13,770-foot peak on Saturday, the Park Service said.
Grand Teton is the highest peak in Grand Teton National Park, located outside Jackson, Wyoming.
