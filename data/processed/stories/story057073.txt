One of the suspects in a California shooting spree that left two sheriff's deputies dead was deported to Mexico twice, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Authorities say Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, Utah, was arrested Friday after police found him in a home in Auburn, about 30 miles from the initial shooting. Also arrested was Jannelle Monroy, 38, of Sacramento County, who was allegedly with Marquez during the rampage, authorities said.
The rampage began in the parking lot of a $56-a-night motel outside downtown Sacramento when two sheriff's deputies checked on a suspicious car there.
Authorities said by the time the spree was over on Friday, the suspects had killed two sheriff's deputies in two counties, wounded a third deputy, attempted three car carjackings and shot a driver in the head -- all during a span of six hours. Those events prompted a handful of school lockdowns and a massive manhunt.

Virginia Kice, a spokeswoman for ICE, says that Marcelo Marquez is actually an alias for a man named Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte. He was removed from the U.S. twice, the first time in 1997 after an arrest and conviction in Arizona for narcotics possession. He was arrested and sent back to Mexico again in 2001.
Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was killed in the spree. The 15-year veteran was a husband and father of two daughters.
The other slain officer was Placer County Deputy Michael David Davis Jr., 42, an 18-year veteran with a wife and four children. Davis died exactly 26 years after his father, a Riverside County sheriff's deputy, was killed in the line of duty, authorities said.
The wounded deputy, Jeff Davis of Placer County, was shot in the arm. He was later treated and released.
The driver who was shot in the head is 38-year-old Anthony Holmes. He is in serious condition in a hospital, according to authorities and CNN affiliates.
