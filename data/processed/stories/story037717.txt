Santos secured the Brazilian club's first Copa Libertadores title since 1963 on Wednesday, defeating Uruguay's Penarol 2-1 in the second leg of an ill-tempered final.
After a scoreless first leg in Montevideo last week, goals from young Brazil striker Neymar and midfielder Danilo ensured Santos won South America's premier club competition for the first time since legendary football icon Pele played for the team half a century ago.
A late own-goal from defender Durval offered Uruguayan side Penarol hope of snatching a sixth Libertadores title, but Santos prevailed at the Estadio do Pacaembu in Sao Paulo.
Neymar, who has been linked with a move to a host of European clubs including Real Madrid and Chelsea, broke the deadlock with a well-struck shot early in the second half.
Danilo, a Brazil under-20 international, scored what proved to be the winning goal after 68 minutes with a driven shot beyond Penarol goalkeeper Sebastian Sosa.
Santos' post-match celebrations were soured by a mass brawl which broke out between both sets of players, immediately after referee Sergio Pezzotta had blown the full-time whistle.
Multiple kicks and punches where thrown amid chaotic scenes, with a small number of Santos fans running onto the pitch to celebrate with their team, having clinched the title for the third time in the club's history.
Police stepped in to separate the two squads, with players from both sides also attempting to make the peace.
