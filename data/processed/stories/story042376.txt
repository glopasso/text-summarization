Napoli moved level on points with Juventus at the top of Serie A with a 2-0 against Catania at Stadio San Paolo on Saturday.
Slovakia's Marek Hamsik scored in the 31st minute latching onto Juan Camilo Zuniga's cross to put the hosts ahead.
The 25-year-old midfielder was also involved in the second, setting up defender Fabio Cannavaro who scored from close range a minute before the break.
The win, which puts Napoli on 49 points, keeps the pressure up on Juventus who travel to Chievo on Sunday.
Saturday's other game saw the mid-table clash between Torino and Sampdoria finish goalless.
Roma, who crashed to a 4-2 defeat at home to Cagliari on Friday, have sacked coach Zdenek Zeman.
"AS Roma wishes to announce that Mr Zdenek Zeman has been relieved of his duties as first-team coach," said a statement released on the club's official website Saturday.
"The club thanks Mr Zeman and his collaborators for the professionalism and dedication shown in carrying out the job."
Aurelio Andreazzoli will take temporary charge of the team.
The 65-year-old rejoined Roma last summer -- he coached the Giallorossi between 1997 and 1999 -- but the team has struggled in recent weeks and currently lie 8th in Serie A, nine points behind locals rivals Lazio and without a win so far in 2013.
