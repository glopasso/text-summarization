A pregnant woman has gone missing on the picturesque Hawaiian island of Maui, spurring a search that has led to her torched SUV -- but not her.
Maui police first issued a missing persons alert for Carly "Charli" Joann Scott on Wednesday, two days after her mother reported her missing.
The 27-year-old woman, who is 5 months' pregnant, was last seen around 8 p.m. local time Sunday at her sister's home in Haiku. She left there in her silver 1997 Toyota 4Runner.
The missing woman's mother, Kimberly Scott, said it "is very unusual for Carly to just up and leave without telling anyone," according to a police statement posted on Maui County's Facebook page.
Authorities were able to track down her vehicle in the Peahi area on Wednesday. While it was burnt, police said that its vehicle identification number was legible and tied it to Scott.
The next day, a member of the search party looking for the Hawaii resident found what police only described as "possible evidence."
"We are asking anyone who is assisting in the search to call the (police) department if they find any suspicious items, however, please do not touch, move or recover the item as it may be evidence in this case or another case that the department is investigating," the police said.
CNN affiliate KGMB/KHNL reported that Scott's ex-boyfriend -- who said he loved her and that the two "occasionally hooked up" -- told them that he'd been with her last Sunday night. The two were following each other on a road, but then he claimed he lost track of her.
The ex-boyfriend claimed that he'd assisted in searches for Scott, though her family had become "hostile" to him lately.
Scott's stepfather, Johnny Pipkin, told the same affiliate that the family was riding a roller coaster as it did everything they could to find the woman they called "Charli."
"It's moment to moment," Pipkin said. "Up, down. Up, down. Tired ... Frustrated."
