Game over for a Brooklyn man who tried to conceal parts of a .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun in a PlayStation 2.
Oscar Ramirez, 48, was arrested by Port Authority police on a weapons charge Wednesday after Transportation Security Administration checkpoint officers discovered the gun at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

Parts of the firearm were also packed in Ramirez's carry-on luggage alongside a tripod and other belongings, including the video game "Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots," according to the TSA. Presumably someone was planning to play after the weapon was unpacked from the PlayStation.
Ramirez was bound for Mexico City when he was arrested.
So far this year, the TSA has discovered 2,100 guns at airport checkpoints, a 16% increase from 2013.
Passengers caught with guns at checkpoints may face criminal charges and penalties of up to $11,000, the TSA said.
