Los Angeles prosecutors are reviewing Justin Bieber's alleged fight with a photographer last month to decide if the pop star will be charged, a spokeswoman in the prosecutor's office said Wednesday.
The photographer filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department accusing Bieber, 18, of misdemeanor battery, a sheriff's spokesman said.
He said Bieber attacked him as he was taking photos of Bieber and his girlfriend, Selena Gomez, at a Calabasas, California, shopping center, a sheriff's spokesman said.
Bieber and Gomez, 19, left the shopping center before law enforcement officers arrived.
The photographer complained of pain and was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released, the sheriff's spokesman said.
Sheriff's investigators have turned over their findings to prosecutors, Los Angeles District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Jane Robison said.
