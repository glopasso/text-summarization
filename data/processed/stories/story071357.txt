Baseball great Nolan Ryan, president and chief executive officer of the Texas Rangers, was to undergo medical tests Monday after being hospitalized a day earlier, the Rangers said.
Ryan was hospitalized in Houston, Texas, "for what is believed to be a recurrence of the heart condition which he has previously experienced," the team said in a statement.
He was taken to the hospital Sunday after experiencing discomfort Sunday at his home in Georgetown, Texas, the statement said.
Ryan expects to be released in a few days, the Rangers said.
During 27 years in the major leagues, Ryan threw a record 5,714 strikeouts while playing for the New York Mets, the California Angels, the Houston Astros and the Texas Rangers.
In 1999, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, which says he had "a blazing fastball that approached 100mph and a work ethic like none other."
