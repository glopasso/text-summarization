Brian Williams isn't just a veteran newsman: He's also a proud papa.
On Wednesday, Williams reported on "NBC Nightly News" that his daughter, actress Allison Williams, had been cast in the lead role of NBC's planned live telecast of "Peter Pan Live." There had been much speculation about who would play the boy who refused to grow up.
The elder Williams said his daughter had long wanted to play Peter Pan, though he was coy about his sourcing.
"Family members confirm she's been rehearsing for this role since the age of 3, and they look forward to seeing her fly," he said as a picture of his daughter as a little girl, dressed in a Peter Pan costume, was shown on the screen.
"Peter Pan Live!" is based on the 1954 Broadway musical. Allison Williams is a classically trained singer and co-stars on the HBO series "Girls." For "Peter Pan," she joins actor Christopher Walken, who has been cast as Captain Hook.
