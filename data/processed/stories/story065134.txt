At least 16 people in Iraq were killed Tuesday in 10 car bombs, police said. At least 90 people were wounded.
Three blasts occurred in the capital, Baghdad, and seven were reported to the south, in Babil province.
Three of the suspected bombs blew up in Babil's capital, Hilla.
Amateur video posted on YouTube shows a car exploding in a garage in Hilla, a huge blaze and several vehicles on fire.
Iraq has been engulfed in political and sectarian violence for months. Sixteen people were killed in separate attacks Monday.
