Violent crime dropped nationwide last year, continuing a downward trend of more than a decade, new FBI statistics show.
But in towns with populations under 10,000, murders saw a big jump.
Overall, violent crime was down 4%, according to the Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report for 2011.
Numbers dropped in all categories nationwide. Murders fell by 1.9%, while rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults declined 4%.
But the figures, provided by police agencies, show that murders jumped 18.3% in small towns of under 10,000.
Property crime decreased slightly in 2011 -- down 0.8% overall.
Burglaries stayed almost even across the country, rising just .03% from the previous year. But they were up 3.2% in the Northeast and 1.3% in the Midwest.
The FBI report does not give reasons for the continuing decline.
