Australian hurdler Jana Rawlinson has had her breast implants removed to boost her chances of winning a medal for her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The 27-year-old Rawlinson, whose private life has often made headlines in Australia, said she enjoyed having larger breasts but did not want to "short-change Australia".
"I absolutely loved having bigger boobs, but finally I've grown up enough to know myself -- to be honest about who I am when I look in the mirror," Rawlinson told the Woman's Day magazine.
"I don't want to short-change Australia either -- I want to feel the most athletic I can, to know that I'm standing on the track in London the fittest I can be."
The double 400 meter hurdles world champion, who reportedly plans to remarry her estranged British  husband and fellow-athlete Chris Rawlinson, told the magazine she had the implants because she was unhappy with her athletic figure.
"When I looked in the mirror I just saw muscled arms, broad shoulders and big, strong legs," she said. "These are assets I need to run well, but they didn't make me feel like an attractive woman.
"There are a couple of girls -- who I won't name -- in world athletics who are Olympic champions, but they look like men and I don't want to be like that."
Rawlinson won the 400m hurdles at the 2003 Paris world championships and four years later in Osaka, Japan.
