An earthquake that rattled western Turkey killed at least two people and injured dozens more, hospital and government officials said on Friday.
The 5.8 magnitude quake, recorded late Thursday, occurred more than 200 miles west-southwest of the capital of Ankara, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
Turkey's Kandilli Earthquake Observatory said the epicenter was the town of Simav in Kutahya province, where aftershocks rippled across the region overnight.
Hospital officials in Simav reported about 150 injuries, most of them minor, and some structural damage has been reported.
Emergency officials swiftly responded with search and medical crews, and supplies such as blankets, water and food.
The Kutahya region recently had a scare of leaked cyanide-contaminated water from a wastewater dam after an embankment collapse.
Crews are checking to see whether the dam was damaged by the quake and so far, there is "no risk," said Veysel Eroglu, the environment minister.
