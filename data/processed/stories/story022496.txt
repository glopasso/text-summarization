A spray-painted anti-Muslim message was discovered Thursday morning on the front of the Al-Farooq Islamic Center in downtown Nashville, Tennessee, according to police. A written note disparaging Islam also was left at the mosque, police said.
Video from the scene showed "Muslims go home," in red spray paint across a window of the mosque.
The mosque was established in 2003, according to the center's Web site.
The FBI also is involved in the investigation.
CNN could not immediately reach mosque members for comment.
