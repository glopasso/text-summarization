President Barack Obama was about to address the nation on Iraq Thursday night when the briefing was delayed because of a security breach on the North Lawn of the White House.
But this wasn't your normal breach, this was one of a pint-sized variety.
A toddler forced the President, the press corps and the nation to wait.
The little boy managed to squeeze himself between the bars of the White House fence, just before the briefing was expected to start. It forced a temporary lockdown.
It didn't take long to resolve the matter and he's now back with his parents.
"We were going to wait until he learned to talk to question him, but in lieu of that he got a timeout and was sent on way with parents," according to Edwin Donovan, spokesman for the United States Secret Service.
The boy's parents now have a story to tell their son -- the night he made the nation wait for the president.
