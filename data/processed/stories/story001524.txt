This month on Road to Durban, CNN's Robyn Curnow, Nkepile Mabuse and Ayesha Durgahee meet in Johannesburg, South Africa's most populated city, to explore the efforts being made to cut the country's carbon emissions.
Electricity from sugar
Nkepile Mabuse discovers how waste from the country's largest sugar producer, Illovo Sugar, is being converted into electricity to power the company's mills and feed the national grid. The unique process of utilizing bagasse (sugar cane fibers) and biomass as an energy source has made the mills into energy providers, as well as sustainable industries.
Miners' homes from waste
Mabuse also discovers how waste from a coal mine in Emalahleni is being used to build affordable new homes across South Africa. Gypsum brick -- which is a by-product of the mining process -- can reduce CO2 emissions from the construction of each new house by as much as three tonnes.
Greening the deep blue
Ayesha Durgahee travels to Cape Town to find out how an aquarium is harnessing the power of the wind and sun. With an innovative vertical wind turbine and a neat solar array, renewables are helping the Two Oceans Aquarium reduce its dependence on fossil fuels.
A renewable vintage
Robyn Curnow travels to the heart of South Africa's wine country to discover how a vineyard is exploiting renewable energy to power its production process. From growing the grapes to bottling the wine, The Villiera Vineyard in Stellenbosch just outside Cape Town, is exploiting both solar and hydroelectric power to produce some of the country's most recognizable wines.
