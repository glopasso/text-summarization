A powerful blast leveled a house Wednesday in Boston, Massachusetts; it was not immediately clear if anyone was injured.
Boston police said on Twitter that a gas explosion was suspected and that a construction crew had been digging near the house at the time of the blast.
Police said nearby homes were evacuated and people were advised to avoid that area of the Hyde Park neighborhood. Aerial footage showed an empty space amid rows of neatly lined houses.
Residents told CNN affiliate WHDH they felt everything shaking around them. Windows of several houses shattered.
Firefighters on the scene told WHDH they believed the two people who lived in the house were not home at the time of the blast.
