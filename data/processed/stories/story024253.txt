The NBA rewarded patient fans Sunday with an exciting game that kick-started a season delayed five months by a lockout.
The comeback New York Knicks, behind Carmelo Anthony's 37 points, edged the Boston Celtics 106-104.
The much-anticipated rematch of last season's NBA Finals, between the Dallas Mavericks and the Miami Heat, turned out to be a bust. The Heat beat the champions 105-94, but the Mavs trailed by more than 30 points at times.

Other matches include the Chicago Bulls vs. the Los Angeles Lakers; the Orlando Magic vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder; and the Los Angeles Clippers vs. the Golden State Warriors.

Owners had sought to change the old revenue-sharing arrangement that gave players 57% of the revenue. The new deal offers a virtual 50-50 split.
