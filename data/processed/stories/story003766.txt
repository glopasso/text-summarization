(CNN)The TV season is winding down, and the finales are starting. Those endings lead off this week's six things to watch.
1. "The Americans," 10 p.m. ET Wednesday, FX
Critics continue to praise "The Americans" as one of the best series on TV, and every finale has delivered in a big way.
Season 3 has seen a battle for the soul of daughter Paige, the return of fan favorite Margo Martindale and Soviet agent Nina getting back in the game.
The finale is titled "March 8, 1983." That's the date when President Reagan called the Soviet Union an "evil empire." We shall see what surprises lie in store for the season ender.
2. "Fresh Off the Boat," 8 p.m. ET Tuesday, ABC
Critics and viewers seem to have taken to "Fresh," the first sitcom with an Asian-American cast since the 1990s.
It hasn't been picked up for a second season, but the signs are looking good.
3. "Vikings," 10 p.m. ET Thursday, History
The first History Channel scripted series, which been renewed for a fourth season, wraps up on Thursday.
4. "Scorpion," 8 p.m. ET Monday, CBS
This based-on-a-true-story show, about a ragtag band of geniuses sent on secret missions, got a lot of hype for CBS in the early going, and that was enough to get it a second season.
With the producers safe in that knowledge, we could get a surprising season finale.
5. "Broadchurch," 10 p.m. ET Wednesday, BBC America
Fox's American remake, "Gracepoint," didn't last, but the British mystery series starring David Tennant continues. Another murder could be solved -- and the trial based on the events of season 1 resolved -- by the end of this finale.
6. Academy of Country Music Awards, 8 p.m. ET Sunday, CBS
Luke Bryan and Blake Shelton return to host the 50th annual awards. Christina Aguilera is set to perform a "surprise duet" (yes, that Christina Aguilera).
