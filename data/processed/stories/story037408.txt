Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal has signed on with Washington-based Leading Authorities to find paid speaking appearances for him, the lecture agency announced Tuesday.
McChrystal, who also will be lecturing at Yale University this fall, will earn between $30,000 to $60,000 an event, according to one person knowledgeable with the deal.
He already has booked "multiple engagements," the source said, adding  that there has been a "significant amount of interest across industries"  to hear him speak.  His first paid speech will be this fall at a  private engagement.
McChrystal commanded the U.S.-led military coalition in Afghanistan until he resigned from the military this year after controversial comments published in a magazine profile.
The retired general will speak about leadership, management strategy and global affairs, according to a Leading Authorities press release.
A spokeswoman for Yale said earlier that McChrystal has been appointed a senior fellow with the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at the university, beginning in the fall semester.
McChrystal will teach a graduate-level seminar for students in the international relations master's program, Yale spokeswoman Dorie Baker said.
