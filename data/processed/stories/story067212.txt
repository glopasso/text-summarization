The lead singer of rock group Lostprophets was sentenced Wednesday to 35 years in a British jail for child sex abuse, a court ruled.
The sentence for a string of child sex offenses -- including the attempted rape of a baby -- includes 29 years behind bars for the disgraced rock star, according to Britain's Press Association news agency. Six years are on license, meaning he will remain under police supervision.
Ian Watkins, 36, confessed to 13 offenses at Cardiff Crown Court in Wales last month. On Wednesday, Judge Roger John Royce said the case broke "new ground," according to Press Association.
"I am satisfied that you are a deeply corrupting influence, you are highly manipulative, you are a sexual predator, you are dangerous," Royce said. "The public and, in particular, young females need protection from you."
Watkins must serve at least two-thirds of the sentence before he can be considered for release. Two co-defendants identified only as Mother A and Mother B were sentenced to 14 years and 17 years, respectively.
Police said they were investigating whether Watkins committed similar crimes in Germany and the United States.
"The investigation uncovered the most disturbing child abuse evidence I have seen in my 28 years as a police officer," Detective Chief Inspector Peter Doyle, senior investigating officer for South Wales Police, said in a statement.
"There are also investigations being conducted by other police forces around the world including Germany and the United States."
Lostprophets, a Welsh group which has sold more than 3 million records worldwide, broke up in October.
