A family in Washington that was one of two jackpot winners in the Mega Millions drawing will speak to reporters about its windfall Thursday.
However, the buyer in Idaho with whom the family will split the $380 million prize has yet to come forward.
Washington lottery officials have so far only disclosed that the family is from Ephrata, a small town with a population of just over 6,000. They have scheduled a news conference at 2 p.m. (5 p.m. ET) to introduce the lucky family that will claim $190 million -- half of the $380 million jackpot -- from the Tuesday night drawing.
The ticket was sold at a Safeway store in Ephrata, lottery officials said.
Store Manager Geoff Bell told CNN affiliate KREM that the phones began to ring off the hook when news surfaced that the store had sold one of the two winning tickets.
"It's great for the community. It's nice that Safeway can be a part of helping somebody make some dreams come true for them," Bell told the affiliate.
The ticket in Idaho was sold in Post Falls.
Tuesday's Mega Millions numbers were 4, 8, 15, 25, 47 and 42 (42 was the Mega Ball number).
As days went by without a winner, residents in the 42 states that take part in the Mega Millions drawing rushed to stores to buy more and more tickets, pushing the jackpot to $380 million -- the second-highest in the drawing's history.
The highest was $390 million in 2007.
