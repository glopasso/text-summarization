Paul Walker's mother has dropped her court bid to take guardianship of the late actor's daughter, a lawyer for Cheryl Ann Walker said Thursday.
Cheryl Walker filed for guardianship of 15-year-old Meadow Walker in March, claiming that Meadow's mother, Rebecca Soteros, has a "drinking problem."
Attorney Steven Bledsoe said Cheryl Walker has filed papers that requested her guardianship petition be dismissed.
The document says Cheryl Walker has told a investigator for the court why she wanted to drop the case but would further explain at a scheduled court date April 30, if necessary.
Meadow Walker, 15, stands to inherit an estimated $16 million from her father's estate.
Walker died in a fiery car crash in Los Angeles during a break in filming "Fast & Furious 7" in November.
