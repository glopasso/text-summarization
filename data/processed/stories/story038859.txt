Sorry to burst your bubble, My Little Pony and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. But it was a few other classic toys that earned entry into the National Toy Hall of Fame on Thursday.
Rubik's Cube, little green army men and yes, plain old bubbles won the honors over nine other finalists. The toys will become part of the National Toy Hall of Fame collection at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.
Anybody can nominate toys for the honor, but inductees are selected by historians, educators and others based on the objects' icon status, longevity and innovation. They range from simple playthings like the ball and the stick to beloved brands like Barbie and Lionel trains.
Others toys nominated in 2014 included American Girl dolls, Hess trucks, the Slip 'N Slide, the paper airplane and yes, pots and pans -- those kitchen staples that creative kids have been treating as toys for generations.
Last year's inductees included the rubber duck and the game of chess. Toys previously inducted into the Hall of Fame include Monopoly (1998), roller skates (1999), jack-in-the-box (2005) and in 2012, "Star Wars" action figures and dominoes.
But there's still hope for My Little Pony and the other runnersup: They'll be eligible again next year, and many finalists aren't inducted on their first try.
