Lauryn Hill has been performing her song "Black Rage" in concert for years, but on Wednesday she released a recording of the song in support of the residents of Ferguson, Missouri, in the wake of the Michael Brown incident.
The singer tweeted on Wednesday, "An old sketch of Black Rage, done in my living room. Strange, the course of things. Peace for MO" along with a link to the recording on SoundCloud.
Sung to the tune of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "My Favorite Things," the lyrics include "Black rage is founded on/Blatant denial/Squeezed economics/Subsistent survival" and "When the dogs bite/ When the beatings/ When I'm feeling sad/ I simply remember all these kinds of things and then I don't fear so bad."
Hill is just one of the members of the hip-hop community lending support.
Rapper and St. Louis native Nelly, joined protesters as they marched, and artist J. Cole, visited and released the song "Be Free" in tribute to Brown.
Activist and hip-hop artist Talib Kweli mixed it up with CNN's Don Lemon on Thursday while explaining what he saw during protests.
"As an artist I wanted to put my money where my mouth is," Kweli said. "I'm supported by the community that's been brutalized. I have a son that's Mike Brown's age."
The unrest in Ferguson has even caused a crossover of sorts.
"Sleepy Hollow" star Orlando Jones took a page from the ALS "Ice Bucket Challenge" to issue one of his own. After dumping a bucket of bullets over his head in a YouTube video posted on August 18, the actor spoke out about the slaying of Brown and what has resulted in Ferguson.
"This past week I've watched an American city become something akin to a war zone," said Jones, who added that he is a lifetime member of the NRA. "I'm challenging myself to listen without prejudice, to love without limits and to reverse the hate. That's my challenge to me and hopefully you will accept this challenge too."
