A New York judge has denied a request to reduce the bail of a woman accused of running a multimillion-dollar escort service for high-powered clientele, according to court documents.
The bail for Anna Gristina, a New York mother of four, is currently set at $2 million bond or $1 million cash. The reduction request was denied Tuesday.
Gristina, 44, was arrested on February 22 and has been charged with promoting prostitution in the third degree. She is suspected of running a brothel out of an apartment in Manhattan's Upper East Side.
Prosecutor Charles Linehan said his office had requested the large bail because Gristina is considered "an extremely high flight risk."
On Tuesday, a Morgan Stanley broker was placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation into Gristina, according to company spokesman Mark Lake.
Prosecutors say Gristina was with the broker in his Manhattan office shortly before her arrest, saying the pair were there to discuss the creation of a website that arranges illicit encounters.
The broker, who CNN is not naming because he has not been charged with a crime, said they were in talks to create a website for a legitimate dating service.
Gristina's next court date is scheduled for May 3.
Her attorney was not immediately available for comment.
