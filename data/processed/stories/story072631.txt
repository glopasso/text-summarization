Mexican federal police have arrested a man who authorities say could have been involved in the March shooting deaths of three people with ties to the U.S. Consulate in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, the country's public safety ministry said.
Jose Guadalupe Diaz Diaz, known as "El Zorro," is also suspected in the slaying of a federal police officer, the ministry said in a statement Thursday.
Authorities are investigating the 32-year-old's "likely participation in the killings of three people linked to the U.S. Consulate" in Juarez, the ministry said.
The statement did not specify how Diaz allegedly participated in the shootings. Thursday's statement from Mexican security officials described Diaz as a leader of the Aztecas gang, a street gang affiliated with the Juarez cartel.
Mexican authorities have arrested several others they accuse of being connected to alleged killing of three people with ties to the Juarez consulate.
The shootings occurred March 13 when consulate employee Lesley Enriquez and her husband, Arthur Redelfs, were gunned down as they left a birthday party in their white SUV.
Jorge Alberto Salcido Ceniceros, the husband of another consulate employee, was killed in a separate vehicle.
In addition to his possible involvement in the shootings, Thursday's statement alleged that Diaz was responsible for the distribution and sale of drugs in several locations in the border state of Chihuahua.
Also in this week's operation, authorities arrested Reynaldo Diaz Diaz, known as "El Rey." The ministry said he provided security for the Aztecas gang, and was suspected in slayings and drug distribution.
Police seized a number of weapons including a hand grenade, more than 1,700 rounds of high-caliber ammunition and five bullet-proof vests, the ministry said.
