(EW.com) -- Think you'd escape the week without eyeing yet another close-up of a Jersey Shore man? The universe gifted us with the birth of two Jersey Shore stars this week, which means double the the hair gel, double the fun!
Happy Birthday to Pauly D, a.k.a. DJ Pauly D, a.k.a. Paul DelVecchio, who turns 32 today. As we all know, getting deeper into your 30s requires some thoughtful maturation, chucking of old partygoing, sloppy ways, and cultivation of more structured daily habits. Perhaps less "Cabs are here!" and more "Subaru minivans are here!" How about shedding "It's T-shirt time!" for "It's pinstripe-oxford time!"?
Pauly D's been trying to grow up, and we should chronicle and commend his short-but-honorable journey toward post-Jersey Shore-adult-ish-ness.
Example 1: Pauly D got his own show "The Pauly D Project," in which he jumps sand-deep into the transition from No. 2 "Jersey Shore" man to self-actualized DJ.
Example 2: The man who once told The Daily News that it takes him 25 minutes to sculpt his trademark reverse-trapezoidal 'do cut his hair into a sleek Great Gatsbian coif!
"Jersey Shore" stars gotta grow up sometime and leverage any residual fame for semi-lucrative business deals. After all, youth is fleeting â€” hair today, and gone tomorrow.
