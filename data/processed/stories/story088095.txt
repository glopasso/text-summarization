Hip-hop artist Lil Wayne pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted criminal possession of a weapon, the Manhattan district attorney's office said.
Lil Wayne is expected to receive a one-year jail sentence for his guilty plea.
He is expected to receive a one-year jail sentence, the office said. The Grammy Award-winning artist, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, is due for sentencing in February.
His trial had been scheduled to begin in January.
When he was indicted in February 2008, Carter pleaded not guilty to a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, the district attorney's office said. His guilty plea Thursday was to a reduced charge.
He was arrested in July 2007. Police officers said Carter and another man were smoking marijuana on a street, and the officers found a .40-caliber pistol in Carter's possession.
Born and raised in New Orleans, Carter launched his solo career at age 16 with the release of "Tha Block is Hot" in 1999. He won two BET Awards in 2007 and four Grammy Awards in 2009.
