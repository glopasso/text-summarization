Doctors are "satisfied" with Nelson Mandela's progress three days after he underwent endoscopic surgery to remove gall stones, but he will remain under their care for the time being, the office of the South African president said in a statement Tuesday.
According to the statement, doctors said "there is no crisis, but add that they are in no hurry to send him home just yet until they are satisfied that he has made sufficient progress."
"We urge the public to continue supporting Madiba, but at the same time to understand that he is 94 years old and needs extraordinary care," the South African presidency said. "If he spends more days in the hospital, it is because that necessary care is being provided."
