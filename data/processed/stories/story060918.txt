Oft-troubled actress Lindsay Lohan has had another brush with the law, charged by police with leaving the scene of an accident in New York early Wednesday.
Lohan was driving her Porsche Cayenne into the parking lot of the Dream Hotel off West 16th Street when she allegedly hit an employee of the restaurant next door, said Sgt. John Buthorn, a New York Police Department spokesman.
The entertainer kept driving before parking her car and apparently leaving the scene shortly after midnight, Buthorn said. Police arrested her about 2:30 a.m., and she was later released on her own recognizance.

The restaurant employee was hospitalized with a knee injury, Buthorn said.
A representative for Lohan sent CNN a statement, which read: "While some of the facts are still being gathered, it appears that this is much ado about nothing. We are confident this matter will be cleared up in the coming weeks and the claims being made against Lindsay will be proven untrue."
The former child star is trying to make a career comeback after six years of legal troubles.
Earlier this year, Lohan completed five years of felony probation mandated after two drunken driving incidents in 2007. Since January of that year, she has spent 250 days in five rehab facilities dealing with drug and alcohol addiction.
Buthorn said police do not suspect drugs or alcohol played a role in the latest incident.
In addition, Lohan spent six short stints totaling less than two weeks in the Los Angeles County jail as well as 35 days of home confinement.
Last month, Los Angeles County prosecutors released a report saying that Lohan, who is still on probation for a 2011 shoplifting incident, was a suspect in a burglary at a Hollywood home. However, prosecutors determined they did not have enough evidence to charge her.
