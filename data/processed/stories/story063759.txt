Zimbabwe's foreign minister is calling for reform of the United Nations Security Council following the "extrajudicial" killing of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
NATO's role in Libya highlights the need for more democracy and accountability, Simbarashe Mumbengegwi said late Tuesday at a celebration to mark the anniversary of the United Nations.
Gadhafi's "brutal extrajudicial killing" shows the Security Council is not accountable to member states of the U.N. General Assembly , he said.
The former leader was fatally shot last week after he was captured in his hometown of Sirte following months of protests calling for his ouster.
"The past nine months (in Libya) have demonstrated how a few countries ... can easily treat the Security Council and its resolutions with utter contempt and render that important organ of the United Nations most impotent," he said.
"Although other important members of the Security Council protested at the abuse of UNSC Resolution 1973, they could do nothing to stop the abuse since any effort to do so would have been vetoed by those in NATO who wield the veto power."
The resolution calls for NATO to "take all necessary measures" -- without using an occupation force -- to protect civilians and population centers under the threat of attack in Libya.
