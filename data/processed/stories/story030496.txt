Health advisories were issued for four beaches in New York City Thursday evening as wastewater from a plant continued to discharge into the Hudson River, according to a press release from the New York City Department of Environmental Protection.
A four-alarm fire at the North River wastewater treatment plant triggered flooding of wastewater into the Hudson River Wednesday morning, after a blaze began in the plant's engine room.
The health advisories were issued for South Beach, Midland Beach and Cedar Grove Beach on Staten Island, and Sea Gate in Brooklyn, according to the release.
The beaches are not closed but the New York City Department of Health recommends that people not swim or enter the water at those locations. They also recommend that young or elderly people, or anyone who suffers from a medical condition not go near the water at those beaches.
The advisories will last through Monday.
Popular Coney Island Beach was unaffected by the advisories as of Thursday evening.
All employees at the plant were accounted for following the incident with no injuries, New York City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Cas Holloway told CNN affiliate WPIX.
The facility was not operational on Thursday evening but department staff and contractors were inside the facility working to bring the plant online.
The plant is responsible for treating 120 million gallons of wastewater a day on Manhattan's west side.
