The last remaining personal property belonging to Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff and his wife, Ruth, netted nearly $500,000 in an auction in Miami Beach, Florida, the U.S. Marshals Service said Tuesday.
Proceeds from the June 4 auction go to the U.S. Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture fund and will be used to compensate "the many victims of this crime of historical proportions," said Neil DeSousa, U.S. marshal for the Southern District of Florida. "Rest assured that the U.S. Marshals Service's top priority in this case was restitution toward the victims."
To date, about $24 million in property sales and $80 million in cash assets from the Madoffs have been recovered, the Marshals Service said.
Art, antiques, furniture and clothing from the Madoff residences in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, were featured in the 275 lots included in the final auction.
Madoff, the mastermind of an estimated $50 billion Ponzi scheme, pleaded guilty in March 2009 to 11 felony charges, including money laundering, perjury, false filings with the SEC and fraud. He was sentenced to 150 years in prison.
