(EW.com) -- In its short, sweet first season, Shonda Rhimes' Scandal introduced powerhouse political fixer Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and her powerful associates, including President Fitzgerald "Fitz" Grant himself (Tony Goldwyn). Before "Scandal's" Blu-ray/DVD hits stores tomorrow, Washington shared with EW her favorite moments from the D.C. drama, discussed her electrifying chemistry with Goldwyn, and even dished on season 2.
Though Washington claimed to love the "dirty work of acting," she clearly prefers watching co-star Guillermo Diaz "torture" another actor rather than the steamy scene she shared with Goldwyn. "That stuff is not fun, at all," she said. "Those are private moments. But that's what acting is -- it's about... having the courage to allow your audience into the private moments of your characters' lives. Those are difficult."
Another kind of torture? Not letting herself be paralyzed by the knowledge the man with whom she's steaming up the small screen is happily married. It's just an occupational hazard, though: "Anybody who cares about somebody who has to do scenes like that [has to be] really compassionate." She adds, "Tony's very in love with his wife and his daughters, who I've met. It's all good!"
Never fear, Fitz fans! Washington assured, "I know Tony's still going to be around" when the show resumes filming in July.
But that doesn't mean all Olivia's relationships are secure. How will Olivia react when she learns what peppy underling Quinn has been hiding? "A lot of that depends on who she is," said Washington. "I don't think Olivia makes decisions on how to treat people or how to navigate a situation blindly. She really takes into account the circumstance at hand."
"Scandal" season 1 comes out on Blu-ray/DVD tomorrow.
