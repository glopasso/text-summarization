"NCIS" fans will get a triple dose of those crime investigations on CBS this fall.
The network has added four new dramas and a new sitcom to its fall lineup, and one of the dramas is the "NCIS" spinoff set in New Orleans. As CBS announced on Wednesday, "NCIS: New Orleans," starring Scott Bakula, will air on Tuesday nights following its parent program.
The major shift in CBS's 2014-2015 calendar is the network's addition of "Thursday Night Football." Instead of its comedy block anchored by "The Big Bang Theory," CBS will air three hours of football on Thursday nights from September 11 through October 23.
While Thursdays are dominated by sports, the network's highly-rated "Big Bang Theory" will temporarily air on Mondays. On October 30, CBS's more typical Thursday night lineup will resume, including a 12th and final season of "Two and a Half Men" and a new comedy, "The McCarthys."
