A Mexican beach getaway, a royal castle retreat and a charming Santorini hotel all made the winners list of the fourth annual Fodor's 100 Hotel Awards, announced Wednesday.
While top hotels in 43 countries on six continents made the list, the United States had the most hotels of any country with 20 properties. The European continent had 29 hotels, and London and Paris tied for the cities with the most hotels listed, with three each.
A Fodor's team of 500 global contributors and Fodor's readers nominated thousands of hotels located all over the world. The winners were chosen by Fodor's senior editorial staff, which looked over hotels already chosen as Fodor's Choice picks and the other nominations.
"Winning hotels have to be a Fodor's Choice hotel, have been visited by our team and be the best in their respective cities," Arabella Bowen, Fodor's Travel editor in chief, told CNN. "They have to have superior service, settings, style and amenities. They have to get favorable reviews from experts and guests alike."
Winners were listed in one of eight categories: enduring classics, beach getaways, country retreats, trips of a lifetime, all-inclusive vacations, boutique chic, small hotels and modern city hotels.
Fodor's chose one hotel from each category to highlight for CNN.com readers. Click through the gallery to see their picks.
