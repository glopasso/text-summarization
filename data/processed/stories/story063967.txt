Sure, everyone reading this uses the Internet. But how much do you really know about it?
The Pew Research Center wanted to find out. This week, Pew released the results of a survey seeking to see just how much Internet users know about the Web and the people, tools and technology that make it work.
The results are interesting in that they're all over the board. Pew notes that "knowledge of the modern technology landscape varies widely across a range of topics."
As many as 83% of the survey's 1,066 adult Internet users got one question right.
Only 9% guessed correctly on another.
"Technology permeates modern life and we thought it would be revealing to see how knowledgeable people were about some core concepts and history," said Aaron Smith, author of the report. "Policy makers, tech designers, and those orienting their organizations around digital life can profit from knowing just how 'technology literate' people are and where gaps in their knowledge might be. Just because people use these gadgets a lot doesn't necessarily mean they know everything about how they work and where they came from."
