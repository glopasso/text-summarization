Bubba Watson might be more accustomed to targeting a hole in one but the Christmas No.1 record appears to be his more immediate goal after the golfer revealed his latest music video.
Getting into the swing of Christmas, the two-time Masters winner and self-styled Bubbaclaus appears dressed as Santa -- minus the beard -- in a pair of sunglasses to a rap entitled "The Single."
Bubbaclaus is a character Watson has employed in the past, using his Twitter page to dish out Christmas presents each year.
The record -- his first solo single and music video -- opens to a chorus of "Hallelujah" as Watson conducts two elves with a candy can before breaking into his opening rap. All this while on board his custom-made hovercraft golf buggy, which is emblazoned with the initials BW1.
The chorus line of the single is: "I bet you want to know what's in my bag. Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys? It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Bubbaclaus."
Among the other lyrical gifts are the words: "No sled, no beard, no reindeer. I might put my little gifts on a John Deere," all belted out while driving a miniature tractor.
His latest musical venture comes in the same week in which world No.1 Rory McIlroy warned that golf needed to do more to attract a younger generation of players to the game.
Watson is no stranger to singing on camera having twice appeared alongside fellow golfers Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan as mock band The Golf Boys. The band's first single was entitled "Oh oh oh."
"The Single" has already had over 120,000 views since it was posted on YouTube Tuesday.
