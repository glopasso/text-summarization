Costa Rica grabbed their first points of the 2011 Copa America on Thursday and left hosts Argentina facing elimination after a 2-0 victory over Bolivia.
Second half goals from strike duo Josue Martinez and Joel Campbell secured three points for Costa Rica, while Bolivia endured a torrid evening after having two players dismissed.
The result means two-time world champions Argentina must beat Ricardo La Volpe's Costa Rica in their final Group A match on Monday to avoid an early exit from the quadrennial tournament.
The Central American side went ahead after 59 minutes, when the 21-year-old Martinez swept home after goalkeeper Carlos Arias had saved Heiner Mora's effort.
Gustavo Quinteros' Bolivia were reduced to 10 men in the 71st minute, when defender Ronald Rivero blocked the 27-year-old Mora's goal-bound shot with his arm.
Midfielder Allen Guevara Zuniga stepped up to take the resulting penalty but his effort was well saved by Arias, who also smothered the rebound.
Despite Arias' heroics, Bolivia's task was made harder on 75 minutes when Walter Flores was given his marching orders for a strong challenge on Zuniga.
Costa Rica sealed an important victory with 12 minutes remaining, when the lively Campbell ran clear to slide a shot beyond the helpless Arias.
The team's players celebrated by holding up a shirt dedicated to Dennis Marshall, the former Costa Rica international who died in a car accident in June.
Colombia still lead Group A on four points after their 0-0 draw against Argentina on Wednesday, with Costa Rica second on three points.
Sergio Batista's Argentina are third on two points and must defeat Costa Rica in Cordoba to avoid an early exit from the competition.
