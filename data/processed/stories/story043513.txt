White House hopeful Hillary Clinton has raked in several high profile endorsements as she campaigns for president, but the latest may not be greeted with open arms.
Former "Hollywood Madam" Heidi Lynne Fleiss
Heidi Lynne Fleiss, the former "Hollywood Madam" who was convicted on charges connected to a prostitution ring in 1995, is a big supporter of the New York Democrat's White House bid, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports.
"I'm a big fan of Hillary's. Any woman who's smart, how can you not be?" Fleiss told the paper. "Even if you're a Republican, if you're a woman and you're smart, you have to respect her."
Fleiss currently resides in Nevada -- now a early primary state -- and runs a laundromat, called "Dirty Laundry."
The paper reports Fleiss actually tried to attend a Clinton campaign rally in Pahrump, Nevada, last week, but was turned away because the building was filled to capacity.
According to Las Vegas' KLAS, Fleiss is trying to make it to the White House herself or at least a replica of it. She's currently seeking to open a brothel in Nevada that is an exact recreation of the first family's home.
Fleiss isn't the first former madam to express support for Clinton's White House Bid. Deborah Jeanne Palfrey, also known as the "D.C. Madam," said last May she's pulling for Clinton. And, famed porn star Jenna Jameson has also said she is supporting the New York senator.
