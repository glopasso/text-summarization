Are your New Year's resolutions already losing some of their resolve? Google wants to help.
The company on Thursday posted a list of tools designed to assist with some of the most common January 1 promises, along with an interactive map that lets users share their resolutions and see what others around them are doing.
"The new year has arrived, and with it all the resolutions that we hope to tackle in 2013," Google's Liz Wessel wrote on the company's blog. "But resolutions can be hard to keep. And since eating better, taking control of personal finances, traveling more and learning something new regularly top the list of New Year's resolutions, we've pulled together some of our best tips and tricks across Google to make 2013 the year you succeed with your goals."
On the map, part of the Google Zeitgeist project which tracks search trends and other activity, users can post their resolution and see it appear in a location based on their zip code.
"Research shows that you're more likely to achieve your resolutions if you write them down and have support," Wessel wrote. "Try sharing your goals with communities around you."
In addition to adding your own resolution to the map, you can watch in real time as new ones appear, or view resolutions by category. They include Love, Health, Finance, Career and Do Good, among others.
A quick look at Google's interactive map Thursday found a user in Norway vowing to "stop drinking," someone in South Africa hoping to "work less, earn more" and a Florida man (we assume it was a man) resolving "to grow a mustache."
In the blog post, Wessel also pulls together apps for Google's Chrome browser and Android mobile operating system designed to help with popular resolutions like losing weight, working out more, getting your finances in order and taking up new hobbies.
The list includes diet-related apps like Diet Diary and BBC Good Food as well as links to YouTube channels dedicated to healthy cooking.
