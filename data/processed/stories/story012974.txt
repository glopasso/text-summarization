An Israeli air strike hit two concealed rocket launchers in the Gaza Strip Monday, the military announced.
"Direct hits were confirmed," said a statement from the Israel Defense Forces.
Palestinian security sources in Gaza told CNN that a training camp west of Gaza City was hit. Medical sources said no injuries were reported.
The Israeli military said the strikes came after its "Iron Dome" defense system intercepted a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip above the city of Ashkelon. Another rocket landed in the area and had not been located,
Lt. Col. Peter Lerner called the air strike "an immediate response to the terrorist aggression and its infrastructure in Gaza."
CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed reporting from Jerusalem.
