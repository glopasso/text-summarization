(CNN)James Bond's latest mission has been revealed in the first trailer for "SPECTRE" which was released Friday.
Daniel Craig reprises his role of everyone's favorite spy in the 24th Bond film, scheduled for release November 6. Christoph Waltz, Léa Seydoux, Monica Bellucci, David Bautista and Andrew Scott also star in director Sam Mendes' second Bond film.
The acronym stands for Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion, a fictional global terrorist organization that Bond attempts to infiltrate after a cryptic message from his past returns to haunt him.
Though lacking in stunts and explosions we have come to expect from Bond teases, the first look at "SPECTRE" was packed with clues to the movie's closely guarded plot.
It picks up where the last chapter, "Skyfall," left off, with a shot of the smoldering remains of the bombed MI6 headquarters.
Bond's assistant, Moneypenny, presents him with "personal effects" recovered from the ruins of the "Skyfall" house: a singed old photo of two boys and a man and a temporary certificate of guardianship.
"You've got a secret, something you can't tell anyone because you don't trust anyone," she says.
Then, there's an abandoned home in the mountains, the new Aston Martin DB10, and a secret meeting of shadowy men, including one who addresses Bond as "James."
What does it all mean? See for yourself and let the speculation begin:
