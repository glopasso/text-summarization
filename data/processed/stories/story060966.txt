Editor's note: Beauty and makeup expert Bobbi Brown saves the day with tricks to age-proof your smile, grow out bangs, and make blush stay put.
(Health.com) -- Kim Eliza from New York City asks: I let my hairstylist cut my bangs, but now I hate them! What can I do?
Bobbi Brown: It's one of those things that's happened to all of us. (I once got a cut that turned me into Marlo Thomas from That Girlâ€”it took weeks to recover.)
Aside from wearing a hat or headband, I've found that it helps to style bangs all piece-y (using a tiny dab of styling cream). Once they get longer than your brows, you can pin them to one side with a cute bobby pin.
Another idea to get them off your face: Hold the bangs together up in the air and twist back over your head, then cross two pins over them to secure. Be patientâ€”it could take at least four to six weeks for bangs to (noticeably) grow out.

Min Polley from Sherman Oaks, California, asks: Your teeth look great! How do you keep them that way?
Brown: A bright smile can really make you look young. I had my teeth whitened professionally years ago. But these days, it's my regular habits that help. I go to the dentist every six months, brush with my fave Tom's toothpaste, and rinse after drinking anything colorful, like coffee or red wine.
I also carry those tiny floss picks everywhere. Another good portable idea: disposable toothbrushes. A little makeup helps, tooâ€”a blue-based pink (think berry or fuchsia) lipstick adds instant sparkle.

Hilary Cavanaugh from Clearwater, Florida, asks: I want to touch up my makeup without carting around a lot of products. Any suggestions?
Brown: When I go minimalist, I find I can add a pretty pop of color to cheeks and lips with a bronze-colored cream blush. I also multitask with a brown eye pencil to fill in brows and touch up gray roots. And a clear gloss or balm adds a nice sheen to lips (or eyes!), nourishes cuticles, and tames flyaways. Simple, right?
