(EW.com) -- Things haven't been going great for Paula Deen the last few days: She's been dropped from the Food Network, QVC is "reviewing the relationship," and her biggest defenders so far have been her sons â€” and their examples left a lot to be desired.
But Deen has got at least one public figure in her corner: Anne Rice. The vampire author took to her own Facebook page to defend the chef, but her comments (first discovered by Jezebel) are likely to just cause more controversy.
Rice first posed the question to her readers by saying: "What's happening with Paula Dean? Is it fair? I never heard of her until today, and wow, this looks like a crucifixion. Opinions, thoughts welcome....aren't we becoming something of a lynch mob culture?"

She then decided that the "opinions, thoughts" needed were her own, and had quite a bit to say in the comments, including, in part, "...This woman is just what you said. She's an old southern lady, and she never made these unwise remarks of hers to a black person. We have no evidence at all that she has ever personally insulted or injured any black employee or friend."
No evidence, of course, except Deen's own sworn deposition about the offense level of jokes. "I can't, myself, determine what offends another person," Deen said before going on to explain how she wanted to hire "all black waiters for her brother's 2007 wedding."

Rice continued her defense in the court of public opinion, via Facebook: "It's so easy to persecute an older, overweight, unwise, crude, ignorant woman who may very well be a good person at heart who has achieved a great deal in her life. So easy to vilify her and hate her and try to destroy her life. Woe to anyone today who is not slender, young, clever and politically correct."
Paula Deen will finally be giving her own side of the story on the "Today" show Wednesday. A rep for Rice did not immediately respond to EW's request for comment.
