(PEOPLE.com) -- Reports that producers of NBC's "The Voice" plan to fire coach Christina Aguilera are baseless, says the network.
"There is absolutely no truth to the rumor," Paul Telegdy, NBC Executive Vice President, Alternative Programming, said in an official statement.
Aguilera, 30, remains under contract for the second season of the singing competition, which is set to premiere next February 5 in a key scheduling slot following the Super Bowl.
Cee Lo Green, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton will continue to work alongside Aguilera in the coaching chairs.
