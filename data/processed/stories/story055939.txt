With more than 12,000 miles of coastline in the United States -- not to mention lakeshore -- there's no way CNN.com could name every great beach destination in last week's "22 can't-miss U.S. beaches." We asked readers to submit their favorite getaways in the comments section.
The response was fantastic, and we've compiled a second photo gallery of 20 favorites based on reader suggestions. While we couldn't picture every beach recommendation, our friends living in the Midwest will be happy to note that this gallery includes some freshwater beaches.
Which places do you love? They include Michigan's Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Ohio's Headlands Beach State Park, North Carolina's Corolla Beach, Alabama's Orange Beach, South Padre Island in Texas, California's Black Sand Beach, Oregon's Cannon and Tolovana beaches and Hawaii's Papakolea Beach.
The original: 22 can't-miss U.S. beaches
And we collected more locations than we could list in this latest slideshow. In Florida, readers also recommend Clearwater, Daytona, Ormond, St. Petersburg, Grayton and Playalinda.
Californians could go on for hours: La Jolla Shores, Pismo, Salt Creek, Huntington, Gold Bluffs, Brookings Harbor, Crescent City and Klamath.
Michigan residents, who enjoy more miles of freshwater coastline than any other state, also love South Haven, Holland State Park, Oscoda, Oval and Warren Dunes State Park. Wisconsin folks recommend New Port State Park.
Other nominees include Watkins Glen, New York; Ocean City, Maryland; Hatteras in North Carolina; and Port Orford, Oregon.
7 amazing island rentals
We won't use a blank slide to shame those commenters who declined to reveal their favorites or those who expressed joy that their hideaways didn't make the original list. Who can blame you for guarding the location of your favorite getaways? Everybody needs a secluded place where they can hide out, decompress and rejuvenate from time to time.
