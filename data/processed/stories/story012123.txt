Computer hackers targeted the Zimbabwean stock exchange for the second time this week and used it as a phishing site, an official said Friday.
Phishing is a form of Internet fraud that targets personal information such as credit cards and user IDs.
The stock exchange chief said they have hired IT experts to solve the problem.
"We hope the IT experts will get to the bottom of the problem and identify the source by the end of the day (Friday)," said Emmanuel Munyukwi, the stock exchange chief executive. "The website is a popular source of information and I am sure we have lost a lot of potential investors since we took it offline."
The company has 79 listed companies, but it does not conduct trading on the Internet.
Hacking is not common in Zimbabwe.
Last year, hackers targeted the state-owned daily newspaper, The Herald, and this year, the website of the nation's finance ministry was also affected.
