Veteran Australian paceman Brett Lee has confirmed that he is retiring from Test cricket after being plagued by injuries in recent years.
The 33-year-old, who won 76 Test caps, will still make himself available for one- day cricket once he has fully recovered from an elbow operation he underwent last December.
Lee, who claimed 310 wickets for Australia, missed last year's Ashes series against England after suffering a side strain on the eve of the first Test and has not played for his country since the 2008 Boxing Day Test against South Africa.
"I am extremely proud to have played Test cricket for Australia," Lee told a news conference.
"My reason for retiring from this form of the game is so that I can preserve my body and continue to represent my country in the other forms of the game."
Lee made his debut against India in Melbourne in 1999 and is fourth on Australia's all-time Test wicket-takers list, behind Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee.
"Brett has played a key role in helping the Australian team be one of the most successful Test teams in history," said Cricket Australia chief executive officer James Sutherland.
