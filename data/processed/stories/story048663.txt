Brazilian star Kaka has agreed to join Real Madrid from Italy's AC Milan in a $92 million deal, the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser reported on Tuesday.
Former World Player of the Year Kaka has agreed to join Real Madrid in a $92m move according to reports in Spain.
Cadena Ser claimed that Real president Florentino Perez had thrashed out a deal with AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani and Bosco Leite, Kaka's father and agent.
Kaka is currently in Brazil with the national team ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay and earlier in the day had appeared to rule out a move from Italy's Serie A.
"I'll say it for the last time. The last time. I don't want to leave Milan," he told Gazzetta dello Sport. "In this period I prefer to remain silent because I don't want to be misunderstood. Or, worse still, to be used.
"To the millions of Milan supporters, I say that I have made my choice. I have said what I want to stay. Leave me in peace, please."
However, AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi also hinted at Kaka's departure just before Cadena Ser's claim.
"I do not know if we can keep Kaka at Milan because they (Real) have offered him so much money," Berlusconi was quoted as saying by Italian press agency Ansa.
Spanish reports said Kaka will sign for five years with a salary worth nearly $13 million a year.
Former team-mate Paolo Maldini, who retired at the end of the season, admitted he still had doubts about Kaka's future at the San Siro.
"I don't know if he'll still stay at Milan," Maldini told Gazzetta dello Sport. "Ancelotti might have been cryptic about his future but Kaka has been even more so."
Last January, Kaka rejected a move to Premier League Manchester City who were prepared to pay the 2007 world player of the year $750,000 per week.
Kaka's coach at Milan Carlo Ancelotti was on Monday appointed manager at Premier League Chelsea who have also been linked with a bid for the Brazilian.
