A woman who was arrested with a handgun outside of the White House Thursday night has been charged with a felony, accused of carrying a pistol without a license.
April Debois, 23, of Mount Morris, Michigan, faces up to five years in prison after the Secret Service arrested her just minutes after President Barack Obama delivered his immigration speech.
Debois, who was initially identified by authorities as April Lenhart, made her first court appearance on Friday in Superior Court. She will spend the weekend in jail and will be back in front of a judge on Monday morning.
Her brother told CNN's Pamela Brown that he is stunned by her arrest.
His sister is a caring person and an Obama supporter, he told CNN. He has no idea why she went to the White House, allegedly carrying a gun.
Secret Service agents searched her home in Michigan on Friday.
CNN affiliate WJRT said reporters saw agents remove a long gun from the house and another item that was wrapped in plastic.
Debois was arrested at about 8:30 p.m. on Thursday on Pennsylvania Avenue near the North Lawn of the White House after she was spotted with a gun holstered under her shirt, Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said.
A court document described the weapon as a purple and silver 9mm pistol.
The incident occurred as dozens of people were demonstrating outside the White House after the President delivered his immigration speech at 8 p.m.
The people rallying outside the White House were moved off of Pennsylvania Avenue as the arrest was made, Donovan said.
