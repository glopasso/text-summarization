Authorities are searching for a 2-year-old boy in Bellevue, Washington, after the boy's mother said he went missing when she left him in her car to get help after she ran out of gas.
The mother, who was not identified in a police press release, ran out of gas Sunday morning in the northwestern area of the city with her two children, a 4-year-old and 2-year-old, in the car, authorities said.
The woman took the 4-year-old with her when she went to seek assistance, police said, leaving 2-year-old Sky Metalwala behind.
"Approximately an hour later she returned to the vehicle and the baby was gone," police said in a statement. The boy was reported missing at 9:50 a.m.
About 50 people, including police with tracking dogs, fanned out around the area Sunday to try to find the boy, said Carla Iafrate, a spokeswoman for Bellevue police. The search was suspended as night fell, she said.
Iafrate said the parents of the boy are cooperating.
