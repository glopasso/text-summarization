Authorities in Texas briefly detained a man late Wednesday after he lost control of his car while driving past the Dallas home of former President George W. Bush.
The man was on his way to visit friends when the incident occurred, according to Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan.
He was authorized to come onto Bush's street, Donovan said.
There was no perceived threat to the former president, according to Sgt. Warren Mitchell with the Dallas Police Department.
"President and Mrs. Bush are OK and they appreciate the work of the United States Secret Service and the Dallas Police Department in responding to the incident," said Bush spokesman David Sherzer.
