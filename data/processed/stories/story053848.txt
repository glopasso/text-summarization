(CNN)  -- Arsenal revived their English Premier League title hopes with a 3-1 win at relegation battlers Blackpool Sunday.

Arsenal were forced to field 41-year German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann after Manuel Almunia was injured in the warm-up but they were largely in command after first half goals from Abou Diaby and Emmanuel Eboue.
Gary Taylor-Fletcher pulled one back for Blackpool in the 52nd minute when he scored after referee Lee Mason waved played on when Lehmann rushed off his line to foul DJ Campbell.
If the penalty had been awarded, Lehmann a former Gunners favorite, might have well been given his marching orders.
After some nervous moments, a late strike from Robin van Persie, with the home side appealing for offside, clinched their first win in four league games.
Manchester United must travel to the Emirates on May 1 but Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is more concerned about upcoming games.
"We must win the game in hand. But let's first win our next game against Liverpool on Sunday," he told Sky Sports.
Wenger was full of praise for Lehmann on his second Arsenal debut after his return from retirement to help them out with a goalkeeping shortage.
"Jens can be very proud. The way he practises every day is outstanding.
"He has helped the club win a big game and it will have an impact at the end of the season. He's intelligent and committed."
Blackpool, who were hot favorites to return to the second flight at the first time of asking, remain in 17th spot, just above the drop zone.
In Sunday's other EPL game, Aston Villa eased their relegation fears with a 1-0 home win over Newcastle.
James Collins scored the only goal of the game in the first half as Gerard Houillier's men moved five points clear of the drop zone, but they had to survive some nervous moments as the visitors carved out a number of openings.
