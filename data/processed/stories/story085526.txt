(RollingStone.com ) -- Country fans are dancing on the streets of Chicago... and crying into their Guinness glasses in Dublin.
Garth Brooks confirms new album, world tour
The Windy City will be the first stop on Garth Brooks' world tour â€” his first in 13 years â€” as revealed Monday by a fan named Andy Roberts in Atlanta. The facility maintenance company owner announced the news on Twitter after a personal phone call from Brooks with the Chicago revelation. It seems Roberts was in the audience at one of the country superstar's Las Vegas concerts and asked during a Q-and-A portion of the show where the first tour stop will be. Brooks' answer was that he'd be the first to know and could do whatever he wanted with the information. As for the Chicago date and venue, the "Good Ride Cowboy" will announce that himself on Tuesday.

This news comes on the heels of defeat in Ireland. After a last-ditch effort last week to save his five comeback shows at Dublin's Croke Park, Brooks found out today that negotiations with the city's government are officially over.
"The Irish council cannot change their earlier ruling to not allow the licenses for all five shows," he writes in a statement. "To say I'm crushed is an understatement. All I see is my mother's face and I hear her voice. She always said things happen for a reason and for the right reason. As hard as I try, I cannot see the light on this one."

TicketMaster will now provide refunds to 400,000 ticket holders for the concerts, which were set for July 25-29. While the Dublin City Council would have allowed for three of the five dates to proceed, Brooks likened that decision to choosing between children and said it was "five shows or none at all."
The best-selling solo artist of all time, Brooks will also make his long-awaited return to the recording studio soon. He promises an album of all-new material to be released around late November.
