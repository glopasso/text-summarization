Actor David Arquette ended a one-month stint in a rehab facility, his representative said Sunday.
"He has left after completing treatment," Arquette representative Cindy Guagenti said.
Arquette, who split from wife Courteney Cox in October, entered a live-in rehab facility over the New Year's weekend, his rep said at the time.
Cox and Arquette were married for 11 years and have a 6-year-old daughter, Coco.
