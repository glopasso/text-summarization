A man in Kentucky shot and killed five people before turning the gun on himself after a domestic dispute on Saturday, Breathitt County Sheriff Ray Clemons told CNN.
The gunman was identified as 47-year-old Stanley Neace, said Trooper Jody Sims of the Kentucky State Police, which took over the investigation.
Clemons said Neace's wife and stepson are among the dead.
The shooting happened around midday at a mobile home community of about a dozen trailers, Clemons said. He declined to give the victims' ages and names.
Officers heard a gunshot as they arrived on scene and later found a 12-gauge shotgun, Sims said. The suspected gunman was found dead on the front porch of his house, while the victims were found in two separate residences, he added.
Sims declined to provide details on the victims.
"We are in the process of getting the names of these five victims and making final family notifications," he said.
Neighbor Martha Jackson told CNN affiliate WLEX that Neace ran up to her and asked to use her phone.
"I said, 'Do you want me to call 911 for you?' and he said, 'yes,' and told the police ... 'Stanley Neace was shooting, running in people's homes, killing 'em,'" Jackson said.
Jackson said Neace was told not to go back, but Neace said, "I've got to go, my wife is there."
Breathitt County is located in rural eastern Kentucky.
