Marc Marquez continued his scintillating form in 2014 with another pole position at qualifying on Saturday for the French Grand Prix.
The reigning MotoGP world champion clocked a time of one minute 32.042 seconds -- a new lap record at the Le Mans circuit -- ensuring he will start Sunday's race at the front of the grid for the fifth successive time this season.
Joining him on the front row is compatriot Pol Espargaro, who was over half-a-second behind on his Yamaha with Italy's Andrea Dovizioso finishing third fastest.
The Ducati rider's compatriot, Valentino Rossi claimed the fifth fastest time on his Yamaha behind Germany's Stefan Bradl. Double world champion Jorge Lorenzo will start from sixth place on the grid.
Marquez, 21, became the sport's youngest-ever champion last year and has carried that winning mentality into 2014, riding to victory in the first four races of the season to clock up a maximum 100 points.
The Honda rider already leads the overall standings by 28 points from compatriot Dani Pedrosa -- who qualified a disappointing ninth fastest on Saturday -- with six-time champion Rossi lying third having amassed 61 points.
