Defending champions Spain are through to the 2012 Davis Cup final after a 3-1 defeat of the United States.
Spanish world No. 5 David Ferrer beat John Isner 6-7 (3-7) 6-3 6-4 6-2 in Sunday's decisive singles match in Gijon, after brothers Bob and Mike Bryan had kept U.S. hopes alive with victory in Saturday's doubles match.
Spain will appear in the final for the sixth time in the last 10 years as they bid for a sixth Davis Cup triumph.
The win extends Ferrer's perfect record in clay-court Davis Cup singles rubbers. The 30-year-old has won all 16 of his matches on the surface.
"I'm very happy, this is a dream for me," Ferrer told the tournament's official website. "Another Davis Cup final, we won here at home in Gijon.
"I won the last match against John Isner, who is a very good player, and this tie was never easy.
"The atmosphere was unbelievable. They supported me all the time in the match. I want to enjoy this moment, I'm really happy."
Injury robbed Spain of 11-time grand slam winner Rafael Nadal, who is struggling with a knee problem.
The final will be a repeat of the 2009 showpiece after Tomas Berdych's straight-sets win against Carlos Berlocq saw the Czech Republic seal a 3-1 victory over 2011 runners-up Argentina.
World No. 45 Berlocq was drafted in for the singles match after Argentina's No. 1 Juan Martin del Porto was forced to withdraw from the tie through injury on Saturday.
Berdych, a semifinalist at the recent U.S. Open, was rarely troubled by Berlocq and sealed a straight-forward 6-3 6-3 6-4 win, much to the disappointment of the Buenos Aires crowd.
The Czech Republic will have home advantage for the final, which will take place between November 16-18.
