The woman who accused Herman Cain of groping her after a 1997 dinner says the Republican presidential candidate is "still in denial" about his conduct.
Sharon Bialek is the first woman to publicly accuse Cain of sexual harassment after last week's disclosure that the National Restaurant Association -- which Cain led in the late 1990s -- made payments to two other women who complained about his conduct. Cain has vehemently denied any allegation of misconduct.
Bialek told CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight" that she came forward Monday "for the other women who couldn't or wouldn't."
"I really hope that what I did will enable other women to come forward in similar situations," Bialek said. "Unfortunately for Herman, he's still in denial."
Bialek told reporters Monday that she sought Cain's help finding a job after being laid off from the trade association's education foundation in 1997. She said Cain suggested meeting over dinner, then tried to reach up her skirt after the meal -- and when she protested, he told her, "You want a job, right?"

Her attorney, Gloria Allred, told CNN her client described Cain's behavior at the time to her then-boyfriend and a longtime mentor, and both have given sworn statements supporting her account. Allred said her client is a registered Republican.
And Bialek said she expects to face public scrutiny following her accusations.
"I know that in the next two days is when everything is going to hit the fan, so to speak, and I'm prepared for it," she said.
She added, "I'm willing to handle it. I'm a tough girl."
