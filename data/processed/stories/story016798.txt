When faced with a dare on "The Talk" on Tuesday, co-host Sara Gilbert picked truth instead.
Gilbert, 39, announced on the CBS show that she's expecting her first child with wife Linda Perry. The couple married in March after dating for three years.
The news came out in the middle of "The Talk's" "face your fears" week, which sees each co-host challenged to conquer their biggest fear. Gilbert's fear is getting hurt or injured, and the show had challenged her to lay on top of a bed of nails and smash a cinder block across her stomach.
Obviously, that wasn't something Gilbert could do.
"I really do believe in facing your fears and doing things that make you uncomfortable," she explained, "but I actually can't do the dare because I'm pregnant."
Cue the eruption of cheers from her co-hosts, who are already vying for the role of godmother.
Although this will be Gilbert's first child with musician Perry, 49, the former "Roseanne" star has two children from a prior relationship with TV producer Allison Adler.
