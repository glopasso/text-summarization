Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius will be served with an indictment in court next week following the completion of the investigation into the killing of his girlfriend, South African police said.
Following his court appearance Monday, the case is likely to be postponed while the prosecution and defense agree on a trial date, police said in a statement.
Pistorius has already been charged with premeditated murder over the February shooting death of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. August 19 -- when he appears in court -- would have been Steenkamp's 30th birthday.
The double amputee track star killed the woman he calls the love of his life on Valentine's Day in his home. He says he mistook her for a home invader.
The police investigation team "is convinced that the accused has a charge to answer," the police statement said.
The athlete's family said in June that he would resume running using his blade-shaped prosthetic legs.
Pistorius has started sprinting again for the sake of his emotional health, not for training to compete again, the family said.
