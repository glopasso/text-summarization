Three people were arrested Saturday after chaos broke out at an "America's Next Top Model" audition at a New York hotel, police said.
"American's Next Top Model" is hosted and produced by supermodel Tyra Banks.
Six people were injured, and two of them sought treatment at a hospital, authorities said.
Police said they didn't know what provoked the bedlam, which resulted in three people being charged with disorderly conduct and inciting a riot in connection to the incident at the Park Central New York hotel in Manhattan.
The audition was shut down after the incident, authorities said.
Calls to Park Central management were not immediately returned on Saturday.
The "Top Model" competition, hosted and produced by supermodel Tyra Banks and aired by the CW network, is in its 12th cycle.
