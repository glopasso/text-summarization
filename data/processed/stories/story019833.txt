A Downtown Disney restaurant in Florida sprang a leak Monday as diners were enjoying their meals.
A fish tank in the dinosaur-themed T-Rex Cafe's aquatic-themed area suddenly sent water spewing toward guests.
Restaurant patron Kate Wallace, who caught the incident on video, told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 that restaurant workers rushed in to get people out of the way and to save the fish in the tank.
"A seal failed on the tank causing water to leak," said Keith Beitler, a senior vice president of Landry's specialty restaurants division, which owns and operates T-Rex Cafe, in a statement.
"Employees took action and did a great job rescuing all of the marine life, caring for our guests and managing the situation. The marine life has been moved to holding tanks and the restaurant is open for business as usual."
Landry's confirms that all of the marine life were rescued alive.
T-Rex is in the Downtown Disney complex, which includes restaurants, entertainment and shops. Downtown Disney sits outside Disney's theme parks in Orlando, and there aren't any entrance or parking fees to enter.
