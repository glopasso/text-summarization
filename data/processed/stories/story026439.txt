A seven-term Wisconsin congressman, who 54% of the American people were not aware of last week, just knocked the president of the United States off of his perch as the most talked-about politician on the largest social media platform in the world.
According to the exclusive Facebook-CNN Election Talk Meter, Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, in the first 54 hours after being announced as Mitt Romney's vice-presidential running mate, sucked up the political oxygen in the social media landscape -- with the Beltway topping the buzz and his home state of Wisconsin close behind.
What caught our eye? The swing states of Virginia (where Ryan was announced) and New Hampshire were also high on the list:

3. Vice President Joe Biden 4.01
4. Gov. Mitt Romney 3.74
For perspective, when Michael Phelps became the most decorated Olympian in history on July 31, he registered a 6.51 on the same 1-10 scale.

Note: The talk meter calculates a jump in buzz, so Ryan's relative anonymity helped him jump up the talk meter scale. Yet the growth wasn't just in buzz, but also in "likes" -- the Facebook term for social approval which enables people to follow your moves closely and voice their support to their social networks.
Ryan's new fan page has grown from zero to more than half a million fans, already topping that of the sitting vice president, Joe Biden.

We often say we write about demographics, not politics. Thus it comes as no surprise that we are once again writing about the gender gap and the age gap in this election -- something that the insights from Facebook reveal also exist online.

How this translates to the election will be something we keep our eye on from now until November. It's staggering when you put it in historical perspective: Today there are 160 million monthly active users on Facebook in the United States -- more than half the U.S. population. In 2008, there were 35 million monthly active users.
