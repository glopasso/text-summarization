The father of a 7-year-old girl abducted and killed near her north Georgia home this month said Sunday he is "relieved" to have his daughter back in Puerto Rico, where she will be buried this week.
A funeral for Jorelys Rivera will be held Monday in Penuelas, her father, Ricardo Galarza, said. The burial will take place Tuesday, he said.
Services were held Saturday for mourners in Georgia before her body was flown to Puerto Rico.
Galarza told CNN last week that he last saw his daughter two years ago, when she visited for the summer. She was supposed to visit for Christmas this year, Galarza said.
Jorelys disappeared December 2 near a playground at a Canton, Georgia, apartment complex. Searchers found her body in a trash bin three days later. Authorities have accused 20-year-old Ryan Brunn -- a maintenance worker at the complex -- of killing her.
Jorelys died of blunt force trauma to the head and was stabbed and sexually assaulted, according to authorities.
A date for Brunn's arraignment has not been set. David Cannon Sr., one of Brunn's court-appointed attorneys, has said that his client will plead not guilty.
