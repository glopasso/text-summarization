Gunmen opened fire at two different bars in northern Mexico, killing nine people and injuring 12, Mexico's state news agency reported Sunday, citing the attorney general's office.
Both attacks occurred in the city of Torreon, Notimex reported.
In the first, which happened around 5:40 p.m. Saturday, three men opened fire at a bar, killing four people and injuring nine, the agency said.
The second attack took place around 8 p.m. Saturday, also at a bar, when a group of armed men shot and killed five people, injuring three, Notimex reported.
The Mexican government says there have been more than 34,600 drug-related deaths since President Felipe Calderon began a crackdown on cartels in December 2006.
