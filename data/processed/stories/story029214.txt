Britain's Royal Air Force scrambled jets Monday to escort a passenger plane in for landing after a man made threats on an Etihad Airways flight, authorities said.
The British national, 37, was arrested on arrival, police in the county of Essex said.
The flight was bound for London's Heathrow Airport from Abu Dhabi, but was diverted to nearby Stansted Airport.
The plane landed safely and the airports are operating normally, officials said. There were no injuries.
