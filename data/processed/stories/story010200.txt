If only they'd all bitten their tongues.
Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry have gotten into a mini war of words over their shared smooch at Cyrus' concert in February.
At the time, it seemed the two pop stars were playing off Perry's hit, "I Kissed a Girl," as Cyrus said after the kiss was over, "I just kissed a girl, and I really liked it a lot."
But according to Perry, Cyrus wanted more than Perry was willing to give.
Her show "was amazing," the 29-year-old said on Australian morning show "Sunrise" on Tuesday. "She has this one part where it's like a kiss cam, and I just walked up to her to give her like a friendly girly kiss, you know, as us girls do, and then she like, tried to move her head and go deeper and I pulled away."
"God knows where that tongue has been. We don't know! That tongue is so infamous!"
Cyrus has heard about Perry's quip and gave her response on Twitter, coyly mentioning Perry's rumored ex-boyfriend, John Mayer.
"Girl if ur worried abt where tongues have been good thing ur ex boo is ur EX BOO cause we ALL know where THAT (tongue) been," Cyrus posted on March 6.
While the stars' back-and-forth appeared to be a little tart, Perry has taken Cyrus' ribbing in stride.
