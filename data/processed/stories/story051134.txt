Dani Pedrosa led from start-to-finish at Mugello to record a dominant victory in the Gran Premio d'Italia, as nine-time world champion Valentino Rossi began his recovery from a horror crash in practice.
The Spaniard looked in total control throughout the race, taking the checkered flag ahead of world championship leader Jorge Lorenzo.
Third-placed Andrea Dovizioso gave the home crowd something to cheer after Rossi fractured his tibia after coming off his bike during practice on Saturday.
The reigning champion was taken straight to hospital for an operation and on Sunday he said it was a complete success.
"I want to thank everyone at Mugello and also all the riders who have wished me well: it's always a great feeling," Rossi was quoted as saying on the official Moto GP Web site.
"The operation went well, Doctor Buzzi has been exceptional and they are treating me like I'm part of the family here. I have had a pin inserted into my leg and tomorrow they will close and stitch the wound, then we will wait and begin a good rehabilitation program."
Of the crash Rossi said: "They were difficult moments because it was a bad crash and a bad injury. I've watched the accident again and to see how my ankle looked was not a good feeling. There were a few moments of fear, but now I'm doing well.
Rossi said his main focus was on returning as quickly as possible: "It will take some time, but the important thing is that I'll return at 100%."
Australian Casey Stoner overtook both Marco Melandri, of Italy and France's Randy De Puniet on the final lap to finish fourth.
But Pedrosa was rarely in any danger and he cut the gap between himself and Lorenzo to 25 points in the world championship standings.
