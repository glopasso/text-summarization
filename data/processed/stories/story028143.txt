The Missouri man charged in the death of 12-year-old Adriaunna Horton made his first court appearance Monday to answer charges of murder, forceable rape, statutory rape and child kidnapping.
Adriaunna was playing with her sisters in a park in Golden City last Monday when two other children saw her climb into a blue SUV.
A state trooper arrested Bobby Bourne at a traffic stop in Golden City that night, driving the same SUV, and arrested him for child kidnapping.
Though Bourne initially denied having anything to do with Adriaunna's disappearance, he admitted during questioning that he was the one who picked her up and said he merely asked her about her father, Barton County Deputy Sheriff Vernon Ring said.
Bourne said Adriaunna ran away from him, fell down, and died from the fall. He led investigators to a wooded area where they found the girl's body, which had evidence of sexual assault and strangulation, Ring said.
CNN affiliate KOLR reported the four charges Bourne now faces and said he attended his arraignment in a bulletproof vest, along with nine guards and a K9 unit.
It could not immediately be determined if Bourne was being represented by an attorney.
Golden City is in a rural section of southwest Missouri, about 25 miles east of the Kansas border.
