(EW.com ) -- Nope, season 2 isn't out yet. But Netflix has renewed "House of Cards" for a third season anyway.
The Emmy-winning political thriller will be back for another 13 episodes, the streaming company confirmed Tuesday. While the second season of the acclaimed drama starring Kevin Spacey will be launched on Valentine's Day.
Netflix might not know how well the new season will perform, but by picking up the show in advance from producer Media Rights Capital the company gets a boost of advance publicity promoting the season 2 premiere date (see above).
"House of Cards" was Netflix's first major entry into the original series game, launching just a year ago. It's since been followed by "Hemlock Grove," "Orange is the New Black" and the" Arrested Development" reboot. Here's the season 2 trailer:
