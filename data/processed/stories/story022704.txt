Images taken on a recent Singapore Airlines flight might suggest passengers had become unusually ferocious in their disdain for the onboard meal.
But this was no "Bugsy Malone"-esque food-flinging fiesta.
The plane hit turbulence shortly after breakfast was served, and the result was culinary carnage.
"Singapore Airlines flight SQ308 experienced moderate to severe turbulence en route from Singapore to London on 26 May," said airline spokesman Nicholas Ionides.

"Eleven passengers and one crew member sustained minor injuries when the aircraft experienced a sudden loss of altitude and were attended to by medical personnel on arrival at Heathrow Airport."
Passengers reported coffee cups, cutlery and even a few people were thrown about the cabin as the plane lost altitude.
Alan Cross, one of the passengers who took the images you see here, told CNN: "Everything violently rocketed off all the tray tables into the ceiling. You literally felt your stomach going into your throat."
The mess was cleaned up soon after and passengers were given chocolate gifts on landing in London.
