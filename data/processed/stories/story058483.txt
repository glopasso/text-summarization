(CNN)A  Los Angeles police officer wanted on murder charges "should be considered armed and dangerous," according to authorities.
Police in Pomona, California -- about 30 miles east of L.A -- issued an arrest warrant Monday for Henry Solis, an LAPD rookie, in the shooting death of a local man over the weekend.
According to witnesses, shots were fired in the predawn hours Saturday after a struggle between a shooter and a victim before a compact car was seen rushing off.
The victim -- identified as 23-year-old Salome Rodriguez Jr. -- later died at a Los Angeles hospital.
Investigators looking for clues discovered an abandoned car about three blocks away from the scene that belonged to Solis.
Authorities soon began looking for the 27-year-old cop to question him, but so far, he has not turned up.
"The suspect knows he is wanted, and that police are actively searching for him.," Pomona police said in a statement.
The LAPD is helping them look for him. Solis, who is still in his probationary phase, was off duty when the killing happened and has not reported back since.
Police have not said how Solis may have been involved in the killing, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.
Residents have built a memorial to Rodriguez, a trucker, at the street corner where he collapsed. Sunday afternoon, they held a vigil and played his favorite songs.
They said he put God and family first.
"He was just sweet," Sandra Soto told KTLA. "He was my best friend."
