Afghanistan, Turkey and Pakistan agreed to hold military drills together after leaders from each nation met in Istanbul Friday, Turkey's state-run news agency reported.
"This is a very important matter. I am happy to see important development," said Turkish President Abdullah Gul, according to Turkish news agency Anadolu. "As a result of work accomplished between our armed forces, there will be a joint military exercise in April 2011."
Gul said the military exercise and the meetings will help to assure stability and security in the region.
During a news conference Afghan President Hamid Karzai was asked if he was open to having the Taliban open an office in Turkey or another impartial country.
"If Turkey can be kind to provide such a venue we, the government of Afghanistan will be pleased and happy to see that facilitation (in) Turkey," Karzai said.
The president referenced an article published earlier this week in the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph, in which former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan Mullah Zaeef said that having the Taliban set up an office in a neutral country may help bring about peace.
Gul said he was not aware of the article but he said "separately and generally, I would like to say that we would do everything that would help stability, security and future of Afghanistan, " Anadolu reported.
