(EW.com ) -- Fox has canceled three freshman comedies, including the most critically bashed sitcom of the season.
The network confirms that Seth MacFarlane's "Dads" is dead. This is actually a bit surprising. The industry tom-toms began to drum in recent weeks that the series starring Giovanni Ribisi and Seth Green was, against the odds, looking very likely for a renewal. Recently, however, the caustic comedy's fortune suddenly reversed. The axing is a win for the critics â€” "Dads" averaged a score of only 15 of 100 on Metacritic.
In addition, "Surviving Jack" is canceled too â€” that's definitely not a surprise. The single-camera sitcom based on best-selling author Justin Halpern's autobiographical book, "I Suck at Girls," is a coming-of-age story set in the 1990s that featured Christopher Meloni as a dad trying to raise his teenage kids. The show struggled in the ratings on Thursday nights.
Lastly, cult-fav comedy "Enlisted" is dead. The Friday night freshman military comedy starring Geoff Stults and Chris Lowell was always a long shot for a renewal, but the feel-good series had plenty of fans and defenders who hoped it would get a second chance.
In the ratings, "Dads" averaged 4.2 million viewers and a 1.8 rating including DVR playback; "Surviving Jack" had 5 million and a 1.4 rating; and "Enlisted" had 2.7 million and a 1.0 rating.
Fox is not commenting on whether the Greg Kinnear legal drama series "Rake" is canceled, but nobody seems to expect the show to return for a second season either.
Earlier this year, Fox announced renewals for Tuesday comedies "New Girl," "Brooklyn Nine-Nine" and "The Mindy Project."
Also, for those tracking this stuff, Fox has passed on comedy pilots "No Place Like Home," "Fatrick" and "Dead Boss."
This is the first of what's sure to be many cancellations over the next several days as broadcasters prepare for their upfront presentation to advertisers. Last week, Fox pulled the plug on drama "Almost Human."
