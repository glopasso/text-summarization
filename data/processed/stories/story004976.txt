A U.S. drone strike Wednesday morning killed at least 10 militants and injured 14 near the Afghan-Pakistani border, a Pakistani military official said.
The attack targeted militants in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It wasn't immediately clear which militant group or groups were targeted.
Haroon Zarghoon, a spokesman of a armed resistance movement, Hizb-e-Islami Afghanistan, said his group was not affected. But, citing his group's fighters in the region, he said one attack was in the Afghan province's Nazyan district, 1 to 2 miles (2 to 3 kilometers) from the border with Pakistan.
Targets included smugglers who had been using an alternate route for bringing goods to Pakistan on foot, Zarghoon said.
One strike occurred in Pakistan's Tirah Valley, according to residents in the area. However, the Pakistani military official maintained that the attacks happened only in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan's Nangarhar province borders Pakistan's loosely governed tribal region.

A few hundred miles to the southwest, two suicide bombers and three other insurgents attacked a border police post in Afghanistan's southern Kandahar province on Wednesday evening, killing three police officers and injuring five other people, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqi said.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, Taliban spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi said.
The two suicide bombers wore women's burqas, Sediqi said. After they blew themselves up, police killed the other three attackers, he said.
The attack happened around 8 p.m. in Kandahar's Spin Boldak district near the border with Pakistan.
