Two Tennessee National Guard members were shot during a fight at a suburban Memphis armory on Thursday, and a third was in custody, authorities reported.
The suspected gunman was subdued by others at the armory, said Rita Stanback, the police chief in the northern Memphis suburb of Millington. Each of the victims was shot once, one in the leg and one in the foot, Stanback said.
A U.S. military official told CNN's Barbara Starr that a Guard member shot two others during a fight.
The armory is on property leased to the Guard by the U.S. Navy, which has its personnel and recruiting commands across the road. The Navy compound was on lockdown after the shooting, the lockdown has since been lifted, the service reported via Twitter.
