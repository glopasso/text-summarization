The storm that whipped the Northeast over the weekend with six to 16 inches of snow has blown off to Canada, but more snow is on its way -- maybe just enough to bring out some of that holiday spirit.
The flakes sweeping across the Midwest and Northeast on Monday and Tuesday aren't expected have the heft of the fast-moving storm that preceded them but are predicted to add a couple of inches to the wintry landscape.
For those who like the sight, expect it to last a few days, especially in the northernmost regions, as deep freeze temperatures settle in and aren't expected to relent until mid-week. Especially above Albany, New York, the mercury will plummet hard, well below zero, the National Weather Service says.
Residents may have cleared their walkways from West Virginia to Maine Sunday, but slush should freeze overnight in many places, leaving slippery patches.
Mounds of snow are piled high throughout New York state and New England
Albany got at least 12 inches, the weather service said; the storm left another 16 inches in Biddeford, Maine.
The big storm came a little early, said one CNN iReporter.
"We usually get these big snow storms in January and the snow on the ground usually stays until springtime since it's always cold here in Albany," Zeynep Rice said.
"Last year was a bit weak in snow until end of February actually. So we're happy to have a solid snow covering on the ground earlier than usual this season."
The storm spared major metropolitan areas like Boston and New York City, but some areas in Maine and along the U.S.-Canada border saw significant snow, the weather service said.
The eastward-moving storm dropped snow earlier across the Midwest and western Pennsylvania, with 9 inches reported in Urbana, Illinois.
Millions of people experienced the big chill as the system paved a white swath more than 1,000 miles long.
