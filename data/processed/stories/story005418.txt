Singer Sean Kingston has been moved from the trauma center of a Miami hospital to its intensive-care unit a day after he and a female passenger were injured in a Jet Ski accident, his publicist said Monday.
"Sean Kingston is now stabilized," said Joe Carozza, Kingston's publicist at Epic Records, in a statement.
Hip-hop singer Trav, who features Kingston in his latest song, said Monday Kingston is "doing well. He just opened his eyes this morning."
Jorge Pino, spokesman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, said the watercraft apparently crashed when it went under a small bridge about 6 p.m.
They were taken to Jackson-Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami.
Carozza said Sunday night in a statement that the 21-year-old musician "was in an accident."
Trav told CNN Sunday night in an e-mail he visited Kingston at the hospital and "he is good in stable condition."
Earlier Sunday, Kingston posted the following message on his Twitter account, which has more than 1.5 million followers:
"South beach... #nicee... bout to get fresh and cause that movie!!..."
The Miami-born artist changed his name from Kisean Anderson to Kingston to reflect his Jamaican heritage.
He shot to fame in 2007 when his debut song "Beautiful Girls" became a No. 1 hit in the United States.
CNN's Alan Duke contributed to this report.
