The U.S. Coast Guard on  Thursday found an additional two bodies of crew members missing after a helicopter crash in Alabama's Mobile Bay.
Rescuers have now found a total three bodies from the Tuesday crash, and have suspended the extensive search even though one other person was still missing, the Coast Guard said.
"The decision to suspend the active search was terribly difficult," said Capt. Donald J. Rose, a Coast Guard commander.  "We saturated 95% of Mobile Bay for nearly two days with both aircraft and boats to thoroughly cover the search area. Now, we must shift our focus to continuing salvage and recovery operations. As we continue to recover wreckage, we will look for the missing crewman."
The helicopter, an MH-65C, crashed Tuesday night while on a mission from the Aviation Training Center at Mobile Regional Airport, a statement from the Coast Guard said.
The cause of the crash is under investigation, the Coast Guard said.
