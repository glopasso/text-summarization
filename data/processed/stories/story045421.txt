As the new year approaches, many travelers are looking for inspiration on where to head in 2015.
This list might help.
Global hotel booking site Agoda.com has just released the results of its Travel Smarts study, which looks at destinations with the highest-rated hotels in the world based on nearly 7 million customer reviews.
Overall, the site says Cape Town, South Africa, is number one, scoring an average of 8.43 out of a possible 10.
The Maldives came in second with an 8.33 average hotel review score.

After every stay Agoda.com users can submit reviews and are asked to score hotels on a scale of 0 to 10 in six categories.
A hotel's total score is an average of those numbers, which the site used to compile its recent list.
