The past is new again for agent 007: The next James Bond film will be called "Spectre."
Director Sam Mendes announced the name of the 24th official Bond film Thursday at England's Pinewood Studios.
Austrian actor Christoph Waltz will join Daniel Craig in the cast. Craig makes his fourth appearance as the rugged British secret service agent.
Ralph Fiennes, Rory Kinnear, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw will be reprising their roles from 2012's "Skyfall." Newcomers to the franchise include Monica Bellucci, Lea Seydoux, Andrew Scott and Dave Bautista.
Shooting for the film, due for release in late 2015, begins Monday.
Mendes all but said the title was a nod to the SPECTRE terror group featured in Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and the early films.
"Those of you who have some knowledge of the Bond franchise and the legend of Bond will probably have some idea of what that refers to, but I couldn't possibly comment," Mendes said.
The film's official Twitter account featured a picture of Bond's new car, a snazzy Aston Martin DB10.
Rome, London, Mexico City, the Austrian Alps and Morocco will serve as some of the film's exotic locations.
