Police say they have discovered more human remains on a Long Island, New York, beach near where the corpses of four women were discovered last year.
The remains of a fifth body were located west of Cedar Beach, Long Island, approximately one mile from where the other corpses were discovered in December, according to Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer.
"There may be clues available now with this body that will help the homicide investigation and will help it move forward," Dormer said.
An investigation will be conducted to identify the remains.
Meanwhile, police say, the hunt for a potential serial killer continues, as does the search for Shannan Gilbert, 24, whose disappearance resulted in the finding of the other bodies within a quarter mile of each other.
The four bodies have since been identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25, of Norwich, Connecticut; Melissa Barthelemy, 24, of Erie County, New York; Amber Lynn Costello, 27, of North Babylon, New York; and Megan Waterman, 22, of Scarborough, Maine.
All four women found dead advertised for prostitution services on the website Craigslist, police said. The bodies were found in various stages of decomposition, and at least one could have been there for as long as two years, Dormer said.
