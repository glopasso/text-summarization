If anyone could lure "Mork & Mindy" star Pam Dawber back to TV, it's Robin Williams.
The 62-year-old Williams is set to reunite with his former co-star on his CBS comedy, "The Crazy Ones." According to the network, Dawber will guest star in an upcoming episode this season. On Instagram, Williams shared the happy news with a photo from their former show:
Williams and Dawber, also 62, portrayed an out-of-this-world odd couple on "Mork & Mindy" from 1978 to 1982. Williams was Mork, the alien curious about life on Earth, and Dawber was Mindy, the human woman he eventually would marry.
It's been a while since we've seen Dawber on TV -- her last credited acting role was in 2000 -- and even longer since we've seen her and Williams together again. In "The Crazy Ones" episode, Dawber will portray an author who goes on a date with Williams' character after his belief in love falters.
"It will be a joy to work with her again," Williams told CBS. "It's a dream come true."
