"Big Bang Theory" star Kaley Cuoco suffered a big bang when she fell from a horse last weekend, according to her representative.
"She did break her leg, but is expected to make a full recovery," said Melissa Kates. "She will not be working this week and there was already a planned hiatus for next week."
Cuoco, 24, told CNN last month that she keeps horses on her San Fernando Valley, California, ranch.
"I'm all about the horses, riding, nature and just the quiet side of life," she said.
She plays the lead role of Penny on the CBS hit sitcom.
