Inter Milan moved into third place in Italy's Serie A after inflicting yet more misery on bottom-placed Bari with a 3-0 win.
Late goals from Houssine Kharja, Giampaolo Pazzini and Wesley Sneijder sealed three points for the Nerazzurri, who are now seven points behind city rivals and league leaders AC Milan with a game in hand.
It was their fifth win in the last six games since former AC Milan coach Leonardo took over from Rafael Benitez.
The only stain on a good night for Inter was a punch thrown by Romanian defender Christian Chivu at opponent Marco Rossi. The officials missed the incident but Chivu may be retrospectively punished.
A poor playing surface gave rise to a scrappy first half of few chances.
Bari did threaten through Sergio Almiron and Simone Bentivoglio before Inter's Brazilian defender Maicon flashed a shot wide of the post for the defending champions.
The home side again went close in the early stages of the second half when Alessandro Parisi forced Julio Cesar into a save.
But with 20 minutes to go Inter made the breakthrough as Kharja, from Morocco, swapped passes with Samuel Eto'o before firing low into the net.
With Bari desperately seeking an equalizer Inter added two more goals late on.
First Pazzini scored his third goal in two games since his $16m move from Sampdoria -- his shot squirmed under Bari goalkeeper Jean Francois Gillet in injury time.
Then Dutch international Sneijder rounded off the scoring, finishing from close range after Kharja's lay-off.
