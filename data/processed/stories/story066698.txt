Who would steal a Vietnam veteran's prosthetic leg?
Police in Philadelphia are looking for a woman who allegedly ran off with Sonny Forriest Jr.'s fake limb outside Lincoln Financial Field during the Eagles game on Sunday night. Forriest often entertains Eagles fans with his singing outside the stadium, according to CNN affiliate WPVI.
Forriest told police that he took off his leg because it was hurting him. It was on the back of his motorized wheelchair when an intoxicated woman in Eagles gear jumped in his lap and broke his microphone, he told CNN affiliate KYW. The woman, who appeared to be in her 20s, then grabbed the leg and ran off.
"She said, 'I will pay you for (the microphone).' I said, 'That's all right, baby, go ahead and have a good time,' and then she disappeared," Forriest said.
This isn't the first time Philadelphia sports fans have ended up in the news for odd behavior. In fact, city officials installed a courtroom in the old Eagles' stadium in the late 1990s just to sentence unruly fans.
In April 2010, a Phillies fan intentionally vomited on a dad and his daughter. In 2000, a Philadelphia Flyers fan ended up in the hockey team's penalty box with enforcer Tie Domi. And who could forget what could be the largest one-sided snowball fight in history, when Eagles fans pelted the Dallas Cowboys team in 1989?
WPVI reports that police found Forriest's prosthetic leg on a subway train about midnight Monday. No arrests have been made in the case.
At least Forriest's team won: The Philadelphia Eagles beat the New York Giants, 27-0.
