You have to wonder how this one made it past so many people over at Hasbro.
The company is offering to replace the extruder tool in its Play-Doh Cake Mountain playset after several complaints that the toy resembles a penis.
"We have heard some consumer feedback about the extruder tool in the Play-Doh Cake Mountain playset and are in the process of updating all future Play-Doh products with a different tool," the company posted on its Play-Doh Facebook page. "Should any consumer want a replacement extruder for this item, they can contact Hasbro's Customer Service Department at 800-327-8264."
The playset allows users to build and decorate a Play-Doh "cake." But some parents were upset over the phallic shape of the extruder tool used to administer the Play-Doh "icing," with complaints that it made for an uncomfortable Christmas morning for some.
"What was the concept of this," one parent posted on the Facebook page. "Why couldn't this be in another form or shape?"
Another tweeted ".@PlayDoh nice job including a dildo shaped implement in cake mountain. Happy holidays!"
CNN affiliate KTUL in Tulsa, Oaklahoma, interviewed some parents about the toy. One said, "It's pretty phallic. That's a pretty phallic-looking cake decorating piece. Not necessary, I don't think."
Some posting on Play-Doh's Facebook page have said it's much ado about nothing.
"We received this for Christmas this year and I'm sorry only a twisted mind will turn a play-doh toy into anything more then a play-doh toy," one parent said. "If your kids old enough to have ANY sort of 'question' about the shape your kids to old to be playing with play-doh or to old to care what it looks like, seriously some parents create problems where there are none and it's sad."
