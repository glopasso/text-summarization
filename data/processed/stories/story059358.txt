A Christian Pakistani woman sentenced to death for blasphemy is innocent and should be released, Pakistan's minister for minority affairs told CNN.
Shahbaz Bhatti reached his conclusion after a three-day investigation into allegations that Asia Bibi defiled the name of the Prophet Mohammed during an argument last year with  Muslim fellow field workers.
Bhatti said he personally submitted his finding to President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday and recommended that Bibi be freed.
"This case was filed on the basis of religious and personal enmity," Bhatti said.
Despite the minister's recommendation, it is still not clear if or when Bibi will be pardoned by the president.
Zardari asked Bhatti to propose names for a committee of scholars and experts who would recommend reforms "to effectively prevent the misuse of the blasphemy law for personal and political reasons."
On Wednesday, a presidential spokesman and spokeswoman told CNN that Zardari will pardon Bibi only if necessary and after the legal process has taken its course.
Bibi has appealed her conviction and death sentence, a process that could take months.
Bhatti said he has advised Bibi's lawyer to file a petition for the court to rule on her appeal as soon as possible. He also said the president has called on authorities to provide added security for Bibi while she is in prison and when she's released.
Bibi's husband told CNN his family received death threats soon after his wife's case made headlines.
