Singer Kelly Osbourne, the daughter of rocker Ozzy Osbourne, checked herself into "a medical facility to address some personal issues," her London publicist confirmed Friday.
Kelly Osbourne is struggling with "some personal issues," according to her spokeswoman.
The British Press Association cited an unnamed source saying Osbourne, 24, is being treated at the Hazelden retreat in Oregon.
"Kelly Osbourne has voluntarily entered a medical facility to address some personal issues," spokeswoman Caroline Barrett said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. "Her family stands by and supports her."
Osbourne was jailed in London in January on a charge of assaulting a British newspaper gossip columnist at a London nightclub last summer. She was freed on bail.
She's been absent in recent weeks from a British radio talk show in which she dispenses life advice to young people.
Her father, who rose to fame with the heavy metal group Black Sabbath, and mother Sharon revealed nearly five years ago that Kelly Osbourne entered the Promises rehab facility in Malibu, California, for treatment of a painkiller addiction.
Their revelation came in an appearance on CNN's "Larry King Live" in May 2004.
"We just had to take evasive action very quickly, because the amount of pills that was found in her bag was astounding," Ozzy Osbourne told Larry King.
Kelly Osbourne gained fame as a teenager when her family opened up their lives to cameras for an MTV reality show "The Osbournes."
She used the exposure to launch her own music career.
