As many as 50 people were injured Saturday afternoon after a car plowed into parade-goers in Damascus, Virginia, a police dispatcher told CNN.
Of those injured, at least five or six were "trauma victims," the dispatcher said.
The accident occurred during the Hiker's Parade at the annual Trail Days festival, which honors the famed Appalachian Trail, in the town near the Virginia-Tennessee border.
Dalton Thomson told CNN affiliate WCYB that he was pushed out of the way of the oncoming car by a hiker.
"We all looked back. There were hikers on top, hikers under the car," said the boy. "It was unreal. Nothing could be as scary as that."
CNN's Janet DiGiacomo and Jennifer Moore contributed to this report.
