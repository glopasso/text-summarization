(CNN)David Bowie's single "Changes" is coming out as a 7-inch picture disc, the latest limited-edition vinyl from the chameleon-like singer.
According to Bowie's website, the track will be released alongside a 7-inch vinyl version of "Kingdom Come," originally performed by Television front man Tom Verlaine and covered by Bowie for his 1980 album "Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)."
Though the song never reached the Top 40, it has always been a fan favorite and one of his better-known tracks.
"Collectors of the 40th anniversary series of picture discs (which celebrate the original RCA releases of Bowie's singles), have long bemoaned the absence of Changes from the series on account of it being the first Bowie single on RCA," Bowie's website said in announcing the news.
"Changes" was first released on the 1971 album "Hunky Dory," which predated Bowie's famous "Ziggy Stardust" persona and a string of Top 10 hits in the 1970s and 1980s.
The tracks will be released April 18 in honor of Record Store Day, a celebration of independent record stores begun in 2007.
Bowie's last studio album, "The Next Day," was released in 2013.
The releases are part of the continuing renaissance for vinyl recordings, which have come back from near-obsolescence to claim  record shares of music sales.
In 2014, vinyl LP sales increased 52% and accounted for 6% of all physical album sales, according to the Nielsen Music Report.
