(CNN)"Duck Dynasty" member Sadie Robertson left small-town Louisiana this week for New York Fashion Week -- and, she can't wait to do it again.
Robertson, 17, is the granddaughter of family patriarch Phil Robertson and daughter of Willie Robertson, current CEO of Duck Commander, the family business on which the show is based. She is also the latest reality TV personality to model designer Sherri Hill's prom collection, following in the footsteps of Kylie and Kendall Jenner.
"I would love to continue to model. It just depends on what opportunities I get," Robertson told People.
"Of course, I want to always stay true to who I am and make sure in everything I do God is getting the glory. If modeling is one of those things that keeps presenting itself to me, I would love to do it and continue to get more involved."
The high school student modeled for Hill in 2013 and partnered with her on a line of dresses, and was clearly eager to return to the runway. On social media, she could barely contain her excitement over participating in the show, thanking Hill for the opportunity.
"So extremely blessed to be a Sherri Hill model and [to] get to walk in New York Fashion Week. Praising God," she said on Instagram.
Robertson came in second on the most recent edition of "Dancing with the Stars."
