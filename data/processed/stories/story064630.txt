(CNN)If you feel a ripple in the Force today, it may be the news that the official Star Wars universe is getting its first gay character.
According to the sci-fi website Big Shiny Robot, the upcoming novel "Lords of the Sith" will feature a capable but flawed Imperial official named Moff Mors who "also happens to be a lesbian."
The character is the first gay figure in the official Star Wars universe -- the movies, television shows, comics and books approved by Star Wars franchise owner Disney -- according to Shelly Shapiro, editor of "Star Wars" books at Random House imprint Del Rey Books.
