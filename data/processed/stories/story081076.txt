Actress Susan Sarandon joked that her guard dogs were on vacation when her New York home was burglarized over the weekend.
Burlgars took Sarandon's laptop, a camera and an undisclosed amount of jewelry late Saturday or early Sunday, according to New York Police spokeswoman Arlene Muniz.
Sarandon tweeted about it Monday: "Thx for all ur concern about the break-in. Most importantly, everyone is safe. Guess that's what happens when the guard dogs go on vacation."
The actress, who owns a best actress Oscar for 1995 role in "Dead Man Walking," was out of town with her "guard dogs." She posted Twitter pic last week of her and the two small pooches relaxing in a boat with the message "Beautiful day on the lake."
Her 22-year-old son, Miles Robbins, came home from a night out in Manhattan at 3:30 a.m. Sunday to discover the break in, Muniz said.
No arrests have been made, the police spokeswoman said.
