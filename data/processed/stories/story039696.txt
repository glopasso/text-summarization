Robert Downey Jr. is once again the most highly paid actor in Hollywood, according to Forbes magazine.
The publication, which regularly ranks who's making top dollar, estimates that Downey earned roughly $75 million between June 2013 and June 2014, putting him at the top of its highest-paid actors list for the second year in a row.
Forbes calculated that Downey earned $75 million in 2013 as well.
Forbes says part of the reason for Downey's lucrative income is his "Iron Man" status. He's played the Marvel hero in three high-grossing, stand-alone features as well as in the 2012 blockbuster ensemble movie "The Avengers." Come 2015, he'll suit up as Iron Man again for the "Avengers" sequel, "Age of Ultron."
At this point, Forbes says that "it would be incredibly difficult for Marvel to continue making 'Iron Man' and 'Avengers' films without him."
Arriving in second place on Forbes' list is Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. In 2013, the wrestler-turned-actor starred in five films, and Forbes estimates that the 42-year-old made $52 million between June 2013 and June 2014.
In third place is Bradley Cooper, whose $46 million should go nicely with the Oscar nods he's earned over the past two years.
Rounding out the top five is Leonardo DiCaprio, with an estimated $39 million, and Downey's "Avengers" co-star Chris Hemsworth -- aka "Thor" -- who made around $37 million over the past 12 months.
