Former "Scandal" actor Columbus Short has again found himself accused of being on the wrong side of the law.
Dallas police arrested Short around 2 a.m. Saturday for public intoxication at the address for Katy Trail Ice House, a "beer garden" and restaurant, police spokesman Warren Mitchell said.
Mitchell had no information immediately on whether, or when, Short, 31, was released from custody.
Short's publicist declined comment Saturday evening.
The actor was arrested in March after being accused of punching and knocking out a patron at a West Los Angeles restaurant. He later pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of battery in that case.
And in April, Short's wife accused him of threatening to kill her and himself with a knife.
Tanee Short filed for both a restraining order, to keep him from her and their 2-year-old daughter, and for a divorce to end their nine-year marriage.
Shortly thereafter, Columbus Short announced he would not be returning to the hit ABC series "Scandal."
