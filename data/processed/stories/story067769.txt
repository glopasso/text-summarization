The U.S. Marshals Service announced Friday the arrest of Felipe Alexander Torrealba, one of its 15 most wanted fugitives.
The agency said he was captured Thursday at an apartment complex in Fort Myers, Florida. It did not say if he resisted when he was apprehended.
Authorities recovered two handguns, about $15,000 in cash, a wig and a pair of binoculars inside the two-story townhouse where the 26-year-old was hiding, the agency said.
Torrealba has eluded capture at least three times before, and was wanted for questioning in a homicide investigation. There were also arrest warrants for him in Texas and Florida for aggravated battery of a law enforcement officer, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, trafficking oxycodone, unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, aggravated assault with a firearm and resisting officers with violence, the agency said.
"Felipe Torrealba has been a violent career offender with a criminal history which dates back to 2000," Angel Gonzalez, deputy assistant director of the U.S. Marshals Investigative Operations Division, said in a statement.
Torrealba, who is believed to be Venezuelan, was added to the Marshal Service's 15 most wanted list in October. The agency had been offering a $25,000 reward for his capture.
