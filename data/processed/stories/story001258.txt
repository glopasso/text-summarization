(CNN)Fans of the "Magic Mike" franchise got a hump day treat with a trailer for sequel "Magic Mike XXL" dropping on Wednesday.
The movies, which chronicle the exploits of a group of male strippers in Florida, feature hot breakdancing moves, lots of skin, mounds of muscles -- and crowds of screaming women bearing dollar bills.
The "MMXXL" trailer opens with a masked Magic Mike, played by Channing Tatum, welding metal in a suggestive manner and then breaking into a smooth dance routine to Ginuwine's "Pony."
The trailer premiered on "The Ellen Show." Its tag line: "Get back to the grind."
The steamy marketing campaign rides on Tatum's toned shoulders, but most of the original cast (except now-Oscar winner Matthew McConaughey) is back to bump and grind for the reboot. Viewers can expect more partying, fast cars and sexual entanglements as seen in the first installment.
On Tuesday, Tatum tweeted a stripped-down movie poster that announces the release date: Coming July 1.
"Magic Mike XXL" is counting on the extra sexy trailer and film poster to build on the success of the first movie, which grossed $167,221,571 worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo. If reactions are any indication, fans don't even want to wait for summer to witness the hotness.
