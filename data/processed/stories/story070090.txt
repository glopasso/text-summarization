(EW.com) -- (And no, it's not to Angela.)
"Boy Meets World" heartthrob Rider Strong is engaged to actress Alexandra Barreto, his rep confirms to EW. The couple met while co-starring in the short-lived TV series "Pepper Dennis" in 2006.
Strong is best known for playing bad boy Shawn Hunter on the '90s TGIF favorite.
In November, Strong revealed that he will not be involved in "Girl Meets World," Disney Channel's highly anticipated BMW spinoff:
"There might be a chance to see some of the 'BMW' cast in a guest spot, and I think it would be nice to find out where our characters have been all these years. But 'Girl Meets World' will be, and I think it should be, its own show. It will be about Cory and Topanga, their daughter, and a new set of characters," he said in a statement.
