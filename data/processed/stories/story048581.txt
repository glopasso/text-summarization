The Jonas Brothers have canceled a planned concert in Monterrey, Mexico, they announced Thursday, following an outbreak of drug-related violence there.
The pop trio said they were saddened not to be going through with the show, scheduled for October 21.
"While they wish to apologize to everyone who planned to attend the concert, this difficult decision was made out of their great affection and concern for their loyal fans in the region," their management said in a statement.
The Disney-backed boy band will go ahead with concerts in Guadalajara on October 23 and Mexico City the following day, the statement said.
Monterrey tickets can be exchanged for tickets to those concerts or refunded at the place of purchase.
