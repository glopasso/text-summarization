Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, of MTV's reality show "Jersey Shore," will soon learn her fate after the young reality star was arrested Friday on disorderly conduct charges, court officials said Monday.
Polizzi is set for a first-appearance court date on August 18 at 9:00 a.m. in municipal court, said Seaside Heights court administrator Jane Carrozza.
According to Seaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd, Polizzi, 22, was acting in a disorderly manner while on the beach at Seaside Heights Friday around 3:30 p.m. She was placed under arrest and was later released with a summons, said Boyd.
Polizzi is not facing any jail time, but she could be fined between $250 and $1,000, said Carrozza.
The arrest comes a day after the widely anticipated "Jersey Shore" second season premiere, which drew more than 5 million viewers, according to ratings firm Nielsen.
Just three days before Polizzi's arrest, on Tuesday July 27, the entire "Jersey Shore" cast rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange.
