About 30 bodies were found in a migrant boat rescued early Monday between Sicily and the North African coast, the Italian navy said.
Italian media reported the boat had 600 people onboard.
Italy has seen a series of tragedies as migrants in crowded boats cross from North Africa to Europe.
In October, Lampedusa made international headlines when more than 300 African migrants died when their ship sank off its shores.
As the closest Italian island to Africa, Lampedusa is a frequent destination for refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. Many of the migrants are from African nations while others have fled war-torn Syria.
Hundreds more have been rescued from often unseaworthy vessels and taken to the tiny Mediterranean island's overcrowded detention center.
