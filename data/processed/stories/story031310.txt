The owner of a Bangladeshi apparel factory where 112 people died in a fire in November 2012 has been arrested and sent to jail.
Delwar Hossain, the owner and managing director of Tazreen Fashions, and his wife, Mahmuda Akther, the chairwoman, surrendered Sunday and were ordered to jail by Metropolitan Magistrate Mohammad Tajul Islam.
The magistrate denied bail.
Most of those killed at the factory were female workers. More than 200 people were injured, and nearly half of the victims were burned beyond recognition. The government supervised the taking of their DNA before burying them.
In December, a Bangladeshi criminal investigation found 13 people guilty of gross negligence of safety measures. They were charged with "culpable homicide," according to a court official.
There were arrest warrants issued for six people, including Hossain and Akther.
The other warrants were for officials of the company.
The factory makes clothes for Western retailers.
Ready-made garments make up 80% of Bangladesh's $24 billion in annual exports.
