Mudslides killed at least 13 people after Fernand slammed into the east of coast of Mexico, state media reported Monday.
Fernand was a tropical storm when it made landfall late Sunday, bringing heavy rains. The storm quickly fizzled into a tropical depression and had dissipated by Monday afternoon, forecasters said.
But even as it weakened, authorities in the state of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico said the storm brought heavy rains that caused deadly mudslide in several locations.
All of the deaths were caused by mudslides that buried homes, Veracruz Gov. Javier Duarte said, according to Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency.
Fernand formed over the western Bay of Campeche on Sunday.
As of 4 p.m. ET, the storm's remnants were about 75 miles (125 km) west-southwest of Tuxpan, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 30 mph (45 kilometers per hour), the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said.
The storm was expected to dump between 4 and 8 inches of rain over the states of Veracruz, Hidalgo, northern Puebla, southern Tamaulipas and eastern San Luis Potosi, with more than 15 inches of rain in some places.
Forecasters warned that more life-threatening mudslides were possible.
