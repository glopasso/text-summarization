"Modern Family" actress Sarah Hyland asked for and received a temporary restraining order against her ex-boyfriend, actor Matthew Prokop, her lawyer said Tuesday.
"The documents speak for themselves," attorney Lee Sherman said in a statement sent to CNN. He declined to give details of what happened to bring the case before a Los Angeles judge.
CNN was unable to obtain the judges order Tuesday evening, but celebrity news website TMZ published quotes from the document.
"His grip was so tight that I could not breathe or speak," Hyland, 23, said in a sworn statement. "I was scared and in fear for my life."
Hyland said in her affidavit attached to her application for the protective order also said that Prokop "relentlessly bombarded me with vile, threatening and emotionally disturbing texts and voice mails including his own suicide threats."
Hyland will not speak publicly about the incident, Sherman said. "Out of respect for the court, the process and all parties, I have advised Ms. Hyland not to comment on the matter. We request that you respect the parties' privacy during this time."

Hyland, who plays Haley Dunphy on "Modern Family," met Prokop, 24, when they both auditioned for Disney's "High School Musical," according to People magazine. They split in August after five years of dating, the magazine said.
Prokop's representatives did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment.
