After a blockbuster summer with the action thriller "Lucy," Scarlett Johansson is eyeing TV.
The 29-year-old actress and new mom has signed up for a limited TV series based on Edith Wharton's "The Custom of the Country," Variety reports.
Wharton's 1913 novel followed the intensely ambitious heroine Undine Spragg as she climbed the ranks of New York society. Johansson will portray the lead in the eight-episode series, and will also serve as an executive producer.
It's a change of pace for the actress, who has been working mainly in movies since she was a kid, although she did appear in the pilot episode of the short-lived 1995 TV series "The Client," and has done voice work for Adult Swim's "Robot Chicken."
More recently, she's been finding success as an action star, playing the Black Widow in Marvel's blockbuster movies. In July, she starred as the titular ruthless heroine in Luc Besson's "Lucy," which earned $125 million domestically.
