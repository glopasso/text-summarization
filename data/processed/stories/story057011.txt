Spain's footballing dominance continues as the country's under-21 team emulated their senior counterparts by winning the European Championship title on Saturday.
With Spain having also won the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and top club side Barcelona claiming the 2011 UEFA Champions League, it gives the Iberian nation a full collection of major crowns.
Ander Herrera and Thiago Alcantara were on target as the U21s defeated Switzerland 2-0 in the final in Denmark to give Spain a third triumph in the two-yearly age-group tournament -- and first since 1998.
Midfielder Herrera headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime in Aarhus as he stole in at the near post to connect with a cross by left-back Didac Vila.
It was the Athletic Bilbao player's second goal of the tournament, having also scored in the 1-1 group-stage draw with England.
It was the first the Swiss had conceded, having marched into the final for the first time with four successive victories.
Thiago, part of Barcelona's double-winning squad last season, sealed Spain's victory with a moment of genius as he caught goalkeeper Yann Sommer off his line with a 40-meter free-kick.
Meanwhile, Belarus qualified for the Olympic Games for the first time after beating the Czech Republic 1-0 in Saturday's third-place playoff match in Aalborg.
Defender Yegor Filipenko volleyed an 88th-minute winner to earn entry to London 2012 after the Czechs had Lukas Vacha sent off with 15 minutes to play for a second yellow card.
Belarus had lost 3-1 to Spain in the semifinals, while Switzerland won 1-0 against the Czechs in a match that also went to extra-time.
