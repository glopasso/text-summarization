(HLNtc.com) -- Basketball star Lamar Odom was arrested early Friday on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, the California Highway Patrol said.
The incident began at 3:25 a.m., when the 33-year-old athlete was observed driving in a "serpentine manner at 50 mph," a highway patrol report said. Police pursued his white Mercedes SUV for about three miles before Odom stopped, the report says.
Odom "showed objective signs of intoxication and he was unable to perform his field sobriety tests," police said in a news release. He was taken to Van Nuys Jail, where he refused all chemical tests, it said.
With bail set at $15,000, Odom was released at 8:30 a.m. with a promise to appear at the Van Nuys Courthouse on September 27.
In 2001, Odom admitted to having violated NBA drug policies twice.
"I've made a couple (of mistakes) and I may make a couple again, but hopefully they won't be as big as this one," Odom told reporters then.
Khloe Kardashian, who married Odom in 2009 after a 30-day courtship, tweeted about her frustrations last weekend after rumors surfaced that her husband was addicted to pain medications.
"Really hard to sit here and listen to people talk (expletive) about my family! (Expletive) you and shame on you! I'm too protective for this (expletive)!" the reality figure tweeted on August 25.
Odom and Kardashian have starred in their own show, "Khloe and Lamar," which aired on the E! network.
Odom is a free agent who has played in the NBA for 14 years, for the Los Angeles Lakers, Dallas Mavericks and, most recently, the Los Angeles Clippers.
