Bolivian police have seized a massive stash of cocaine diluted inside hundreds of wine bottles, state media reported Thursday.
Authorities believe the $2 million worth of diluted and solid cocaine is tied to a drug trafficking organization that made shipments to Italy, the state-run ABI news agency said.
Police said they arrested a Brazilian suspect in a raid in a residential neighborhood in the city of Santa Cruz.
The man tried to kill himself with a pocket knife when authorities cornered him, according to ABI.
"They were diluting it and putting it in bottles that they were going to put wine labels on," Marco Centellas, head of Bolivia's special forces to combat drug trafficking, told the state news agency.
