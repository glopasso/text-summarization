(CNN)Here's a look at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, the second oldest continuous sporting event in the United States, after the Kentucky Derby.
The 139th Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show took place February 16-17, 2015. David Merriam judged Best in Show on Tuesday evening.
Facts:The show is "benched," meaning the dogs must be on public display to ticket holders throughout the competition.
Dogs are invited to compete based on strict entry requirements, including how many other dogs they've defeated in breed competitions. Non-invited dogs can also compete if they have won a certain number of major dog show awards.
Breeds are categorized into groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting and Herding.
The dogs compete for Best in Breed, then move up to Best in Group, then compete for the grand prize of Best in Show.

Terriers have won the most Best in Show awards -- 46 as of 2015.
