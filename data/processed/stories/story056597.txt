Comedy Central's successor to "The Colbert Report" will be "The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore."
With "The Minority Report," which starts next January, the cable channel is trying out a new format in the crowded late-night talk show field, just as it did with "Colbert" nearly a decade ago.
Stephen Colbert and CBS announced last month that he would leave his "Report" at the end of 2014 and replace David Letterman on "The Late Show" sometime next year.
Wilmore, meanwhile, will replace Colbert weeknights at 11:30 p.m. on Comedy Central, following "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" at 11 p.m.
Wilmore appeared several times on "The Daily Show" as its "senior black correspondent." His "Report" will diversify the television lineup, since most late-night comics are white men.
"'The Minority Report with Larry Wilmore' follows in the Comedy Central tradition -- bringing new perspectives to the day's events and breaking ground in the world of late night television," said Michele Ganeless, the president of Comedy Central, in a news release.
The satirical "Colbert Report," which premiered in 2005, took its cues from conservative talking head programs such as "The O'Reilly Factor" which were newly prominent at the time. Similarly, "The Minority Report" will borrow from the "panel shows" that have proliferated on cable news. (Fox News has a brand-new one at noon Eastern time, "Outnumbered," with four women and one man, and a popular one at 5 p.m., "The Five.")
"The series will feature a diverse panel of voices currently underrepresented in comedy and television," Comedy Central said.
Stewart's Busboy Productions developed both the "Colbert Report" and the "Minority Report."
Wilmore called himself "beyond excited to have this chance to continue my relationships with Comedy Central and the brilliant Jon Stewart."
His follower count on Twitter more than doubled after the new show was announced.
