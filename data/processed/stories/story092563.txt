Family members of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were involved in a bus accident Wednesday after the high-profile ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of King's "I Have a Dream" speech, police said.
The bus and a car collided near Washington's Tidal Basin just off the National Mall where the ceremony was held, according to Park Police, who have jurisdiction over the Mall.
They said a person in the car was injured and taken to a hospital but did not provide information on injuries to bus passengers.
Several members of the King family were aboard the bus and had laid a wreath at the memorial to the civil rights leader, according to Omarosa Manigault, a reality television star who was aboard the bus.
"We were very afraid," she told CNN. "There were children on the bus, seniors and everything. Everybody was thrown out of their seats."
She said she hit her head in the accident.
