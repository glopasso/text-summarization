LeVar Burton's campaign to revive "Reading Rainbow" just got a big boost.
Actor and "Family Guy" creator Seth MacFarlane has pledged to match donations to the effort, Burton announced on his Kickstarter page. In a video posted there, Burton calls it a "stupendous offer."
"Over the next five remaining days of the campaign, Seth has agreed to match dollar for dollar every pledge made up to $1 million," Burton says in the the video. "It's going to give us the ability to give the Reading Rainbow product away to many more classrooms in need. This is huge!"
The "Reading Rainbow" television series aired on PBS from 1983 to 2006. In a recent interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Burton explained that two years ago the "Reading Rainbow" app was released to keep the tradition of increasing literacy among children alive.
His Kickstarter campaign, Burton said, is aimed at helping that program expand.
"This additional money will help us really have universal access," Burton said. "And help us give the product away to more schools."
As of Friday more than $4 million had been pledged.
