Perhaps Sandra Bullock was just overwhelmed.
The "Gravity" star had a busy Thursday thanks to her Oscar nod, and by the time she took the stage at that night's Critics' Choice Movie Awards, she let an F-bomb slip during her acceptance speech for best actress in an action movie.
Bullock was trying to get out her "thank you's" when a technical glitch interrupted. "What the f***?" a surprised Bullock said before joking that she's an action star.
The 49-year-old wasn't the only to go off-script that night: Bradley Cooper sneaked in the expletive during the best comedy acceptance speech, calling his co-stars "these f***ing actors."
So the two played it a little loose, but on the other hand, they were probably still riding a high from that morning's celebration. Cooper, too, is nominated for an Oscar this year in the best supporting actor category.
2014 Oscars: The nominees list
In fact, some of the Critics' Choice picks mirrored Academy nominations for Oscars earlier that day: Matthew McConaughey, Cate Blanchett, Alfonso Cuaron and "12 Years A Slave's" Lupita Nyong'o were all winners.
Could this be a reflection of what we'll see on Oscars night? "12 Years" director Steve McQueen is probably hoping so. Although it was Cuaron's "Gravity" that won the most awards -- a total of seven, including best director, best score, best sci-fi/horror film and best visual effects -- it was "12 Years" that took home the big prize of the night, best picture.
The film's screenwriter, John Ridley, also won the Critics' Choice award for best adapted screenplay.
