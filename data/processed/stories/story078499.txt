Lee Westwood and Rory McIlroy's decision to skip the Players Championship at Sawgrass in May has been defended by their manager Andrew Chandler.
World number one Westwood and Northern Ireland's rising star McIlroy are giving the tournament, dubbed the "fifth major" a wide berth, saying it did not fit their schedules.
Both have opted to take up European Tour membership in 2011, meaning they can only play three events on the PGA Tour outside of the majors.
Chandler told CNN that moving the PGA Tour's flagship tournament from just before the U.S. Masters to a slot in May had prompted the decisions of his star duo.
"I would think when it was played at the end of the March it was getting to be the fifth major," said Chandler.
"Moving it to the middle of May has made it about the 10th most important tournament in the world.
"It isn't a priority for them as they would rather win a major or a world golf championship event," he added.
The absence of current world number one Westwood from the TPC has been seen as a snub to the PGA Tour, but Chandler says it is purely down to the calendar.
"They cannot play every week," he said.
McIlroy has also denied reports of a rift with PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem for abandoning the U.S. circuit after only one year as a full-time member.
He wrote on his Twitter blog: "For everyone who is interested, the reason I'm not playing TPC this year is because I've never thought the golf course has set up that well for me.
"Hence, two missed cuts in two years. I have no sort of vendetta against Tim Finchem or the PGA Tour; I love playing in the U.S. and have always found the people very welcoming."
South Africa's Tim Clark won last year's Players Championship, with Westwood finishing tied for fourth, four shots behind.
