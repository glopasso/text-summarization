Spanish striking legend Raul Gonzalez scored his 70th European Champions League goal to help Schalke to a superb 5-2 San Siro victory over holders Inter Milan in their quarterfinal first leg.
An extraordinary match began in remarkable fashion when Inter took the lead after just 27 seconds.
Schalke goalkeeper Manuel Neuer raced out of his area to head away an Inter attack, but he left his goal unguarded as Dejan Stankovic fired the ball home from the halfway line with stunning accuracy for one of the goals of the season.
However, the German Bundesliga side levelled in the 17th minute when Inter failed to deal with a corner and Joel Matip was given space to blast the ball home.
The tie swung Inter's way again in the 34th minute when they re-took the lead, Diego Milito -- the hero of last year's final win over Bayern Munich -- volleying home unmarked from close range after Esteban Cambiasso cushioned his header back across goal from the Inter right.
But that advantage lasted for just six minutes before Edu netted on the rebound from a tight angle after goalkeeper Julio Cesar only parried his initial weak effort.
The visitors took the lead for the first time eight minutes after the break when Raul held off Andrea Ranocchia to fire past Cesar -- and they increased their advantage four minutes later as defender Ranocchia diverted Jurardo's cross into his own net.
The home side's hard task was made almost impossible when they had defender Cristian Chivu sent off in the 62nd minute for a second yellow card.
Schalke continued to pour forward, looking to kill the tie off. Jurardo struck the post with a low shot and Jefferson Farfan also hit the woodwork from close range.
But a fifth goal was not long in coming and Schalke surely made the second leg in Gelsenkirchen irrelevant with 15 minutes remaining when Edu turned and curled home a remarkable fifth goal.
