Serie A champions Inter Milan have completed the signing of striker Goran Pandev on a deal until 2014.
Pandev was a free agent after winning his legal battle against Lazio to be released from his contract.
A return to Inter -- where he spent three years without making a senior appearance earlier in his career -- always appeared likely to be his next move and the Nerazzurri confirmed the deal on Monday.
The Macedonia international has penned a four-and-a-half-year deal and is excited about linking up with Jose Mourinho's side.
He told the club's official Web site: "I am really very happy. My dream was always to remain at Inter, but things have gone well nevertheless. I grew, I became a man, a real player and today I am happy to be here."
Pandev joins an Inter squad eight points clear at the top in Italy, although closest challengers AC Milan have a game in hand.
He added: "The year has started very well for me. Now we need to win the Scudetto and do well in the Champions League so we can all be happy.
"I hope to contribute a lot, but it is especially important to win, then who gets the goals is a side issue."
Lazio were ordered to release Pandev from his contract by the Lega Calcio just before Christmas. He had been at Lazio since 2004 and quickly became a fans' favourite at the Stadio Olimpico.
However, matters turned sour last summer when Lazio revealed they would not accept a bid of less than 19 million euros for Pandev after he filed a transfer request.
The 26-year-old was branded a "rebel" by club president Claudio Lotito and frozen out of the squad, as well as being forced to train separately from his former team-mates.
He was linked with several clubs across Europe, including Liverpool, but opted to remain in Italy.
