Consider Gwyneth Paltrow's so-called feud with Martha Stewart over and done.
In September, it seemed the two women wouldn't be on the best of terms, what with Stewart telling Net-A-Porter's Porter magazine that Paltrow should focus less on building her lifestyle brand, GOOP, and stick to acting.
"(Paltrow) just needs to be quiet," Stewart said. "She's a movie star. If she were confident in her acting, she wouldn't be trying to be Martha Stewart."
While those could be taken as fighting words, Paltrow considered them a compliment.
"I'm so psyched that she sees us as competition," Paltrow said Tuesday at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit in Dana Point, California, according to People magazine. "I think that when anybody criticizes anyone, it really is revealing more about where they are in time and space as opposed to where you are in time and space. ... Sometimes I learn good things from criticism."
As for GOOP, Paltrow's moving full-steam ahead. She's recently added former Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia exec Lisa Gersh to GOOP's fold as its new CEO.
