Retired NFL player Keyshawn Johnson was jailed briefly after an argument with his girlfriend Monday, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.
Deputies were called to Johnson's Calabasas, California, home early Monday "regarding a possible spousal assault," a sheriff's statement said.
"When deputies arrived, it was determined that the resident and his ex-girlfriend were involved in a domestic dispute," the statement said. "The ensuing investigation resulted in the arrest of the resident for misdemeanor domestic battery."
Johnson was released from the Lost Hills sheriff's station after posting a $20,000 bond, sheriff's spokesman Chad Watters said.
Johnson, 41, became an ESPN sports analyst after his career as a wide receiver ended in 2007. More recently, he was a contestant on "Dancing With the Stars" last year. He was the first person eliminated in the 17th season of the ABC show.
Johnson also made news because of his feud with former neighbor Justin Bieber last May. Johnson went to Bieber's home to counsel him about the dangers of going too fast on residential streets, but Bieber wouldn't speak to him, Johnson's rep said. Both Bieber and Johnson have moved from that Calabasas neighborhood.
