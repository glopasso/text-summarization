Cheering Laker fans crowded onto roofs, balconies and sidewalks along a two-mile stretch of downtown Los Angeles Monday to celebrate another NBA championship.
Los Angeles police would not estimate the crowd size, but unofficial reports ranged from 500,000 to two million people converging along the parade route.
The Los Angeles Lakers rode on top of a slow-moving flat-bed truck, waving to the massive throng.
At least six people were arrested along the parade route, LAPD Officer Rosario Herrera said. She did not have details about the arrests.
Asked how many police officers were on the streets to control the crowds, she would only say there was "a sufficient amount of officers out there for parade."
It has been called the "back-to-back" parade, since it was the second consecutive championship for the Lakers.
The team repeated as NBA champs by beating the Boston Celtics last week in game 7 of the NBA finals. It was their 16th NBA title.
