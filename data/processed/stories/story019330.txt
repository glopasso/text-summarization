Apple has released iOS 5.0.1, an update to its mobile OS that fixes a series of issues that drained the iPhone's battery.
iOS 5.0.1 is the first update to Apple's iOS 5, which brought the notifications tray, increased performance and iCloud to the iPad, iPhone and iPod touch.
In addition to fixing the iOS battery issue, 5.0.1. adds multitouch gestures to the original iPad, fixes iCloud bugs and improves voice recognition for Australian iPhone users. This is the first OS update available both via iTunes and over-the-air.
Not long after the release of the iPhone 4S, users began reporting that their phone's batteries were draining faster than before. This issue affected not just iPhone 4S users though, but anybody using iOS 5.
Apple eventually figured out that there were bugs in iOS 5 that were causing the battery drain and enlisted developers to help them find the bug.
On November 2, Apple admitted that iOS 5 had battery performance issues and announced that the company would fix the problem with iOS 5.0.1. Apple has released several betas of the updated OS in the last week.
Our testing of the beta has shown that iOS 5.0.1 provides a noticeable improvement to the iPhone's battery life. We're still testing the updated OS though, and will let you know what else we find.
