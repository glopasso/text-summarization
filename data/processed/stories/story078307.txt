(CNN)Catwoman has been an arch-nemesis for Batman for 75 years, becoming an antihero over time and spinning off into her own comic book series.
But it turns out we didn't know all there is to know about Selina Kyle, aka Catwoman.
This week's "Catwoman" #39 comic revealed that Selina is bisexual. (Like CNN, DC Comics is owned by Time Warner.)
Comic book writer Genevieve Valentine penned a blog post explaining the scene in which Selina is seen kissing Eiko Hasigawa, who has taken on the mantle of Catwoman in recent months, while Selina has taken on the role of a crime boss.
"She's flirted around it -- often quite literally -- for years now," she wrote. "For me, this wasn't a revelation so much as a confirmation."
However, fans who like her flirtation with Batman will not be let down, according to Valentine.
"Please be assured that Selina's longstanding connection to Batman has not been forgotten; that is not how bisexuality (or humanity) works," she wrote.
Valentine has been building toward this moment in the comic's storyline and saw the character of Eiko as a good opportunity to establish Catwoman's sexuality once and for all.
"Eiko has offered a moral challenge -- and we know Selina loves a challenge -- but has also unexpectedly given Selina trust and support at a time when those are in desperately short supply," she wrote.
"Selina is a complicated person; she's drawn to complicated people. In some ways, it's that simple ... though of course, it's never simple."
In 2004, Catwoman was awarded a GLAAD media award for its portrayal of the character Holly Robinson as openly gay.
Batwoman was reintroduced as a lesbian character in 2006 (her series is coming to an end soon).
Fans reacted quickly on Twitter once the news of Catwoman's sexuality came out.
