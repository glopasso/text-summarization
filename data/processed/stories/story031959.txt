(EW.com) -- A federal appeals court has ruled California's gay marriage ban unconstitutional in a decision announced earlier today, likely sending the case to the Supreme Court.
"Proposition 8 serves no purpose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gay men and lesbians in California," wrote Judge Stephen Reinhardt in the decision.
In light of the announcement, celebs have flocked to Twitter to voice their excitement about the ruling.
