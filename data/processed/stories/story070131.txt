A Delaware pediatrician accused of molesting more than 100 of his patients was sentenced Friday to serve his lifetime in prison.
Earl Bradley, whose practice was in Lewes, was sentenced to the maximum sentence of 14 life terms, plus 164 years in prison without the possibility of parole, according to a statement from the office of state Attorney General Beau Biden.
He originally had  faced 529  counts of rape, sexual exploitation of a child, unlawful  sexual contact  and other charges. In June, he was found guilty on 24 counts.
The charges include first-degree rape, forcing girls to perform oral sex on him and filming dozens of children engaging in sex acts.
Police officers and detectives, but none of the alleged victims, testified in June in a bench trial, which is a trial held before a judge and without a jury. Bradley's attorneys did not call any witnesses nor did they make closing arguments.
The evidence against Bradley is based on video seized from his home and office, Biden has said. Public defenders in April challenged the scope of a search warrant used to acquire these tapes, but the judge ruled against them.
According to the indictment, the abuse allegedly occurred between 1998 and 2009. All but one of the 103 alleged victims were girls, some as young as 2 years old. Police arrested Bradley in December 2009.
