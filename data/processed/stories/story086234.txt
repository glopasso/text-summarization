(EW.com) -- "Doctor Who" executive producer Stephen Moffat announced that actress Jenna-Louise Coleman will play Matt Smith's new companion following the departure of Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill later this year.
"It's not often the Doctor meets someone who can talk even faster than he does, but it's about to happen," Moffat said in a statement. "Jenna is going to lead him on his merriest dance yet. And that's all you're getting for now. Who she's playing, how the Doctor meets her, and even where he finds her, are all part of one of the biggest mysteries the Time Lord ever encounters. Even by the Doctor's standards, this isn't your usual boy-meets-girl."
The 25-year-old Coleman's credits include the British soap "Emmerdale," "Captain America," and the upcoming miniseries "Titanic," which was penned by "Downton Abbey" creator Julian Fellowes and will be broadcast by ABC on April 14 and 15.
According to Metro, Moffat revealed at a press conference that Gillan's Amy and Darvill's Rory would make their exit from the show in the fifth episode of the new season.
