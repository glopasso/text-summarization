South African mountain bike star Burry Stander, who narrowly missed out on a medal at the London Olympics, has been killed in a road accident.
Stander, 25, was on a training ride when he was hit Thursday by a vehicle in Shelly Beach, on the country's southeast coast, according to Cycling South Africa, the national cycling body.
Details of the accident are still being investigated, it said.
"Not only is this a loss to South African sport, but we have lost a true gentleman who through his professionalism, modesty and humility, constantly showing sheer guts, represented our country with great pride," Cycling South Africa said in the statement released Thursday.
The organization expressed its condolences to Stander's family, including his wife and parents.
Stander finished fifth in the Men's Cross Country mountain bike event at the Olympic Games in London last year.
It was the second Olympics for Stander, who had finished 15th in the same event at the Beijing Games.
He rode a superb race to move through the field in a race won by Jaroslav Kulhavy of the Czech Republic from Nino Schurter of Switzerland.
Italy's Marco Fontana was third, 25 seconds adrift, with Stander only missing out on the podium by four seconds in a close finish.
He had won the 2011 African championships to book his place at the Games. Adrien Niyonshuti was fourth in the same race to become the first Rwandan to qualify for an Olympic competition.
Stander had recently married the multiple South African road race champion Cherise Taylor.
