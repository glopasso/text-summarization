Andy Roddick has told the official ATP Tour website that he is fit and raring to go as he prepares to defend his Brisbane International title next week.
The world number eight feels he was never in tip-top shape throughout 2010, but he now believes he is over the illness and injury problems that prevented him from performing to the best of his ability.
"For me, it's just a matter of getting healthy. I battled mononucleosis for a big part of 2010 and from there I just felt like I was playing catch-up," the American told atpworldtour.com.
"I think it's the first time I've felt right since last May so when you are fit it takes a lot of the mental pressure off. You feel like you can play anyway you want so I feel fresh, enthused and ready to go."
Roddick, who beat Czech Radek Stepanek in last year's final, added: "I came in last year and hadn't been playing much so this was a really good springboard into the year for me.
"I like playing in this event and my wife enjoys coming here too, so let us not pretend I make any decisions!"
Roddick's words were echoed by his physical trainer Lance Hooten, who told the ATP Tour website: "I haven't seen him this motivated for some time.
"Andy's always been a grinder, a hard worker, but you have to put reins on him all the time because he's always going to work too hard, too long and too much," Hooten added.
The Brisbane International tournament begins on Sunday with Roddick seeded second behind world No. 4 Robin Soderling.
