A nude photograph of pop singer Madonna was sold for $37,500 Thursday afternoon at a Christie's Art House auction.
Christie's auctioned this nude photo of Madonna (partially shown) taken by Lee Friedlander for $37,500.
The photo, originally expected to go for between $10,000 and $15,000, was purchased for more than double its original estimated selling price, a Christie's spokesperson confirmed. The 13-inch by 8 5/8-inch framed photograph was purchased by an anonymous bidder over the phone.
The full frontal photograph was one of several taken by American photographer Lee Friedlander in 1979. Madonna, then a cash-strapped student, received $25 for the entire photo shoot.
Most of the pictures from the shoot were ultimately featured in Playboy magazine in 1985.
