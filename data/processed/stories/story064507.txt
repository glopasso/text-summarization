Hurricane Rick weakened to a Category 3 storm early Monday as it churned toward Mexico's Pacific coast, forecasters said.
Workers fill sand bags at the Pueblo Bonito Rose Hotel on Mexico's Baja Peninsula early Monday.
Rick, still a powerful storm, was expected to weaken further before landfall by midweek.
Maximum sustained winds dropped to near 115 mph (185 kph), the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, said in a 11 a.m. ET advisory.
"Although additional weakening is forecast during the next day or so, Rick is still expected to be a dangerous hurricane as it approaches the southern Baja Peninsula," forecasters said. "Interests in western Mexico, should monitor the progress of this hurricane."
Mexican officials issued a hurricane watch for southern Baja, California, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Forecasters said Rick would cause "potentially dangerous surf conditions."
Hurricane Rick was downgraded to a Category 4 storm Sunday evening.
