Nine people were killed and 957 rescued when a ferry capsized Sunday in the Philippines, leaving crews scouring the waters for survivors, officials said.
A woman and child rescued from a ferry accident off the Philippines on Sunday arrive in port.
Two people remained unaccounted for from the SuperFerry 9 vessel carrying 968 people, according to the Philippine Coast Guard. It had no dangerous or hazardous cargo on board.
The ferry took off from the city of General Santos and was bound for Iloilo City.
Survivors and their families were moved to a nearby location, where they were getting medical help and other forms of assistance, the coast guard said.
An investigation will be conducted after rescue operations are completed.
It was the third major incident involving the SuperFerry 9 in the past three years. No fatalities were reported in the other incidents in 2006 and 2007.
Meanwhile, a Panamanian cargo vessel sank off the central coast of the Philippines, though the 20 people on board -- 18 Filipinos and 2 South Koreans -- were rescued, the Philippine Coast Guard said.
