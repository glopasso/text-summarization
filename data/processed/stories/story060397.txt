The man arrested at Sandra Bullock's home last week allegedly owns "an arsenal of weapons" that included a half dozen illegal machine guns.
Joshua Corbett, who was charged with stalking Bullock, burglarizing her home and possessing one illegal gun, now faces much more serious charges, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
The discovery of the arsenal during a search of Corbett's Montrose, California, home has led to 19 felony counts, including seven counts of possession of a machine gun, two counts of possession of an assault weapon and 10 counts of possession of a destructive device, the prosecutor's spokeswoman said.
DA: Stalker spent hour in Sandra Bullock's home
A judge raised Corbett's bond from the $185,000 set when he pleaded not guilty last week to $2.2 million Wednesday. He is being held in the Los Angeles County jail.
Los Angeles police arrested Corbett, 39, at Bullock's home in the early morning hours of June 8 after he allegedly climbed a chain-link fence topped with barbed wire that surrounded it. Investigators believe he sent more than an hour inside before he was found. Bullock was home at the time, but police have not said whether her young son also was there.
Little information about Corbett has been released, although CNN confirmed through FAA records that he has a private pilot's license.
The charges carry a potential maximum of 12 years in prison, if the suspect is convicted, Deputy District Attorney Wendy Segall said.
