Malaysia's health minister has resigned after being caught on videotape having sex with a female friend the country's national news agency said Wednesday.
A day earlier, Health Minister Chua Soi Lek acknowledged that he was the man in a widely-circulated DVD that showed a couple engaged in sex in a hotel room.
At the time, the 61-year-old also added that he would not resign from his post or his party, the Malaysian Chinese Association, which is part of the ruling National Front coalition.
But news agency Bernama said Wednesday that Chua had resigned from both the post and the party, and his departure was effective immediately.
Chua's wife, Wong Sek Hin, told the news agency that her husband had apologized to her and his three children.
"It is a difficult time for all of us but we have accepted his regret and apology," she told Bernama.
In his admission at a press conference in Malaysia on Tuesday, Chua said the woman was a "personal friend" but did not elaborate.
"I would like to emphasize that I did not make the tape myself. Who has done this and why it was done is obvious. Who made this tape is not important any more," he told The Associated Press. E-mail to a friend
