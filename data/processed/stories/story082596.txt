Want a real home-cooked meal in a foreign country?
Got a burning desire to track icebergs in Canada?
Need to know how to build a proper sandcastle?
The best new travel sites offer these and other unique experiences.
Triptuner.com
TripTuner tries to find your ideal destination by matching travel to your tastes and preferences.
A panel of scales lets you choose the degree of experience you want: relaxing or active, bikini or parka, adult or kid-friendly, beach or mountain, urban or remote, high-end or thrifty, and everything in between.
High preference for "active" and "mountain" gets you to Mount Kilimanjaro, Torres del Paine in Chile or Innsbruck, Austria.
Maxing out "relaxing" and "bikini" matches you with Mykonos, Greece, and the Seychelles.
You can limit recommendations to a region closer to you, for your wallet's sake.
The site's soundboard tuner is fun to play with, but goes no further than booking hotel rooms.

Popular trips include a Harry Potter overnight tour and a terracotta warriors tour.
Travelers can book quirky activities, like learning to build sandcastles, make bows and arrows or become gladiators.

Canceled travel plans waste money.
Paying for the hotel room you can't use adds to the misery.

Seatguru.com
For many of us, being cramped on a plane is as close as this world gets to Hell.
A little extra leg room and space by a window can make a flight almost tolerable.
SeatGuru points out preferred spots on all models of planes, as well as seats of misery, like those too close to the bathroom, those with limited leg room and recline, those often bumped by aisle walkers and even those that have an uneven alignment of TV and window.
There are also seat tips for first- and business-class fliers.

Wwoof.com
Volunteers are given food and accommodation in exchange for helping out with day-to-day chores for four to six hours on a farm or vineyard.
Some hosts have multiple volunteers you can connect with.
This is a cheap idea for wine lovers who might pay thousands of dollars for a high-end vineyard stay.
Depending on the WWOOF (Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms) organization, membership fees vary.
