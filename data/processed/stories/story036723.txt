Niagara Regional Police asked Friday for the public's help in identifying the woman whose dismembered body was found in the Canadian portion of the Niagara River.
The torso, which had no head or limbs, was spotted by citizens Wednesday and recovered near the Rainbow Bridge near Niagara Falls.
"It's important to identify this person to bring closure to family members and to hold those responsible accountable for this crime," Inspector Jim McCaffery told reporters.
He gave details he hoped would help jog someone's memory.
The victim was a white woman, likely in her mid-20s to early 40s, said McCaffery. She had at least one cesarean section, her fallopian tubes were tied and her navel was pierced.
The woman was the victim of a homicide, the inspector said. The body probably was in the water between four and 10 days.
The cause of death has not been released.
Niagara police are working with area police jurisdictions to identify any women who may be missing. So far, they are looking at about 20 cases, said McCaffery.
Authorities have said the homicide was unrelated to another case where the body parts of a woman named Guang Hua Liu were found in several places. Her torso is still missing.
