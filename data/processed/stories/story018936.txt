Police in Kansas City are telling motorists to remain vigilant in the wake of 13 shooting incidents in the past month on major highways and roads around the Missouri city.
Some drivers are nervous, CNN affiliate KCTV reported.
"A little uneasy. It's unaimed, not targeted. You don't know who they are shooting at. It could be anybody," Ashley Quinn told the station.
Some drivers said they were taking secondary roads, especially after nightfall.
No shootings have been reported since Sunday, police said in a news release. But three people have been shot since March 8. None of the victims suffered life-threatening injuries.
Most of the cars have been shot in the driver's or front passenger's doors.
There have been 10 reported shootings in Kansas City and one each in Blue Springs, Leawood and Lee's Summit. Police are also looking into other claims to see if they should be added to the total. Some of those reports were for incidents before March 8, police said
Police are not giving many details on what witnesses have reported, but said at least several of the shootings were linked. They said they would increase patrols in the area where most of the shootings have taken place.
