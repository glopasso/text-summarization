(CNN)  -- World champion Sebastian Vettel extended his overall lead to 60 points despite his final-lap mistake in Canada.
The German's previous closest rival Lewis Hamilton failed to finish the rain-hit race in Montreal, meaning the Red Bull star's advantage was not eroded by Jenson Button's victory.
The McLaren driver moved up to second, with teammate Hamilton dropping to fourth after Red Bull's Mark Webber claimed a podium place.
Red Bull moved 69 points clear of McLaren in the manufacturers' standings, with Ferrari retaining third place despite Fernando Alonso's failure to complete the race.
