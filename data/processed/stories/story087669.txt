A woman died Friday while riding the Texas Giant roller coaster at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington, according to a statement released by the theme park.
The park did not release any details about how the woman died on the Texas Giant, touted as the tallest steel-hybrid roller coaster in the world.
"Since the safety of our guests and employees in our number one priority, the ride has been closed pending further investigation," the statement said.
The Arlington Police Department did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
The Texas Giant was originally designed in 1990 as an all wooden roller coaster. It was redesigned with a steel track and reopened in April 2011 to mark the theme park's 50th anniversary.
At its highest point, the roller coaster is 153 feet and has a drop of 147 feet, according to the theme park.
Thousands of kids hurt yearly on amusement rides
Elsewhere, seven people suffered minor injuries in a boat-ride mishap at the Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, park officials said.
The incident occurred Friday evening when a boat rolled backwards down a lift hill on the Shoot the Rapids ride, park spokesman Bryan Edwards said in an e-mailed statement.
The seven people in the boat were evaluated and treated by Cedar Point emergency medical staff, Edwards said. One of the seven was taken to an area hospital for additional evaluation and was subsequently released, he said.
"Shoot the Rapids will remain closed until park officials and inspectors from the state of Ohio complete their review," Edwards said.
