Alex Ferguson has spent half a lifetime pacing touchlines pointing at his watch, but the boot might be on the other foot if his new lectures overrun at Harvard Business School (HBS).
The Boston-based school announced Friday that the former Manchester United manager has agreed to take up a teaching role on a new program called "The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports."
Ferguson retired last May after claiming a 13th English Premier League title with United -- the 49th and final trophy of an illustrious 39-year career in football management.
The 72-year old has already lectured at Harvard, but will take up "a long-term teaching position" next month.
"I'm delighted to have the opportunity and privilege to contribute to such a respected center of excellence," Ferguson said in a statement released by the University.
"The time I have already spent at Harvard has been a stimulating experience and I look forward to developing my relationship and activities with the students, faculty and friends of the Harvard Business School community."
Ferguson has previously participated in several classes with HBS professor Anita Elberse and has also collaborated with her on an analysis of his management methods.
"We look forward to welcoming Sir Alex Ferguson on the HBS campus to share his remarkable leadership journey, and contribute to our Executive Education participants' ability to make a profound difference in the world," Elberse said.
