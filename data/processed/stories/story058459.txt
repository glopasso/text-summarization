Novak Djokovic is up to number three in the world after defeating Marin Cilic in the final of the China Open in Beijing on Sunday.
Novak Djokovic holds aloft the giant China Open trophy after victory over Marin Cilic in Beijing.
The Serb captured his third ATP title of the year with a 6-2 7-6 victory over the battling Cilic, who beat fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko and top seed Rafael Nadal en route to the final.
Second seed Djokovic took advantage of a 90-minute rain delay, which came at 2-2 in the first set, coming back on center court at the Beijing Olympics tennis venue with sharper ground strokes and well-placed serves.
After holding serve to go 3-2 up, Djokovic broke Cilic straight away and then a second time to take the opening set, with the Croat the victim of two unlucky net cords in the final game.
In the second, Cilic -- a wild card entry -- and Djokovic traded breaks three times to force a tie-break, with the Cilic failing to serve out twice.
Djokovic took control midway, winning a rally that left Cilic sitting on the court to go up 4-2. The Serb closed it out on his second match point when the Cilic sent an inside-out forehand sailing wide.
"I certainly played much better after the rain delay," Djokovic told reporters. "I kind of got my nerves together -- I was very fresh on the court after that. Even though it was a straight set win, it wasn't easy at all. Marin could have had at least a set under his belt."
Djokovic, by reaching the final, is assured of taking over the world number three ranking, surpassing injured Scot Andy Murray.
Meanwhile, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga defeated Mikhail Youzhny to become the first French player to win the men's singles title at the Japan Open in Tokyo.
The world number seven, who knocked out compatriots Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet on his way to the final, chalked up a 6-3 6-3 final win over the Russian.
