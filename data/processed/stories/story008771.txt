Defending champion Caroline Wozniacki suffered a straight sets defeat to unseeded German Julia Goerges in the semifinal of the $2 million WTA tournament in Dubai Friday.
Denmark's Wozniacki had no answer to an inspired Goerges, who won 7-6 7-5 to set up a final clash against Poland's Agnieszka Radwanska.
Sixth seed Radwanska had earlier continued her fine recent form to beat Serbia's Jelena Jankovic 6-2 2-6 6-0 in the first semifinal.
Goerges, whose passage through the draw was helped by the withdrawal of top seed Victoria Azarenka through injury, was rewarded for a display of attacking tennis.
"It's amazing to beat Caroline. I tried to stay aggressive and attack the short balls," Goerges told Eurosport.
Goerges had beaten former World No.1 Wozniacki in their two previous matches, both on clay, with the Dane having the better in their other clashes on hard courts.
She opened up an advantage in the opening set, but Wozniacki broke back to force a tiebreak, which Goerges largely dominated to win seven points to three.
The second set followed a similar pattern of closely contested games, but Wozniacki looked set to level as she carved out a 4-2 lead.
But a fruitless challenge on a line call disrupted her rhythm and Goerges broke back. A further break gave her a 6-5 lead and she served out for victory.
The 22-year-old Radwanska will be a tough opponent for Goerges in Saturday's final after she saw off Jankovic in a topsy-turvy match.
She swept through the decider without dropping a game to win after one hour 43 minutes.
