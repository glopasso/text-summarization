Photographer Terry O'Neill is famous for his iconic images Hollywood stars in the 1960s and 1970s.
One of the 1970s hottest actresses, Faye Dunaway photographed by Terry O'Neill in 1976.
He made his name capturing the era's A-listers including Audrey Hepburn, Orson Welles and Brigitte Bardot in a uniquely relaxed and natural way.
Always polite and professional in his approach, his informal and spontaneous style captured the spirit of the times.
Rising stars, including rock bands The Rolling Stones and The Beatles, did not want the wooden, pre-fabricated images typical of the 1950s. As a result O'Neill became much in demand and his star began to rise alongside that of his subjects.
During the 1980s Terry became the photographer of choice for Hollywood, and his commissions from the time are nothing short of a catalogue of global superstardom.
Terry's success continued into the 1990s and with 65 pictures held by London's National Portrait Gallery, he is today revered as one the great British photographers.
Born in the east end of London in 1938, he began his photographic career working for an airline at Heathrow Airport as part of their photographic unit.
Terry O'Neill's images will be on exhibition through Getty Images Gallery in a pop-up gallery at Westfield, London from 7th July until 3rd August.
