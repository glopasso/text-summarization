Today is a day of national mourning in France. Our show begins a report on a terrorist attack at a satire magazine, and we show how thousands of people took a stand afterward in support of democracy and free press. Also covered: a Revolutionary War hero's time capsule is unearthed in Boston, and cutting-edge technology is introduced in Las Vegas.
