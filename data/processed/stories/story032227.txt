"Vote as if your life depends on it."
Those are the final words of an ominous new Web video that features footage of an American flag being burned and attacks President Barack Obama, saying he is "willfully blind to the threats we face."
The ad, set to be released Thursday -- the 13th anniversary of 9/11 -- is being paid for by a super PAC led by John Bolton, who was a U.S. ambassador to the United Nations under George W. Bush's administration.

Set to run Thursday and Friday, the $138,000 ad buy targets states with key Senate races, including Arkansas, Alaska, New Hampshire, Iowa, Louisiana and Colorado, and also the District of Columbia.
It's the largest media buy the super PAC has made this cycle.
"Politicians say Americans don't vote on national security issues," the narrator says in the Web video. "They are wrong. We are living in a dangerous world. Threats to America are looming everywhere.
"President Obama has been willfully blind to the threats we face," the narrator continues. "When it comes to defending America, reject leadership that is weak, indecisive and apologetic. This November, vote as if your life depends on it."
Bolton's group has been active in this year's midterm elections, seeking to keep national security a top priority. With an eye on 2016, Bolton himself has left the door open to running for president.

His group has raised $1.4 million this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
In a prime-time address Wednesday night, the President announced that the U.S. will lead a coalition to "degrade and ultimately destroy" ISIS "wherever they exist."
