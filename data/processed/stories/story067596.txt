Another day of rainy forecasts has pushed NASA to put off the space shuttle Endeavour's piggyback flight to California for a second day, the space agency said Monday.
The orbiter had been scheduled to take off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida atop its 747 carrier plane on Monday morning. NASA planed to take the craft on a three-day cross-country tour before delivering it to Los Angeles, where it will be put on display at the California Science Center.
But storms over the Gulf Coast states forced the agency to postpone Monday's takeoff by a day, and a poor forecast for Tuesday triggered another delay until Wednesday, NASA says.
Endeavour was the baby of the shuttle fleet, built as a replacement for the ill-fated Challenger. It made 25 flights into space between 1992 and 2011.
