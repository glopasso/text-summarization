The widow and mother-in-law of a man killed by a CIA contractor last year were found dead Monday in Lahore, Pakistan, police said.
Zohra, the widow of Faizan Haider, and her mother were shot in a family dispute at their home, said police Inspector Javed Siddiqui. The bodies were sent to a hospital for an autopsy, and authorities were seeking a suspect, he said.
Haider was one of two men killed in Lahore in January 2011 by Raymond Davis, an American CIA contractor. The deaths sparked a diplomatic tussle that strained relations between the United States and Pakistan.
Davis said he shot the two in self-defense when they attempted to rob him at gunpoint as he drove through a busy Lahore neighborhood, but authorities at the time called the case "clear-cut murder."
He was charged with murder and illegal possession of a firearm, but was released after more than $2 million in compensation was paid to the victims' families, according to Pakistani officials.
The killings caused outrage in Pakistan, a key U.S. ally in the war against al Qaeda and Taliban militants in neighboring Afghanistan. And it heightened tension between the two nations, with Congress warning Pakistani leaders that billions of dollars in U.S. aid could be jeopardized without Davis' release.
Davis appeared in a Lahore court after the payment was made and was acquitted of the charges in accordance with an Islamic practice known as diyat, or compensation. Diyat, enshrined in Pakistan's penal code, allows victims to pardon a murderer with or without being paid "blood money."
Haider's widow submitted an affidavit to court stating she had pardoned Davis after the payment.
The heirs of Fahim Shamshad, Davis' other victim, also received payment, Rana Sanaullah, the provincial law minister of Punjab province, said at the time.
