Three Somali men pleaded guilty on Friday to piracy and hostage-taking charges involving the yacht Quest, a February hijacking that ended with the death of four American citizens.
Mohamud Hirs Issa Ali, Mohamud Salad Ali and Ali Abdi Mohamed -- all in their 30s -- entered guilty pleas in federal court in Norfolk, Virginia.
The piracy and hostage-taking charges carry mandatory life sentences. In their plea agreements, the three men said, "They played no role in the murder of the four United States citizens," according to a news release.
Americans Scott and Jean Adams, Phyllis Macay and Bob Riggle were found shot to death when U.S. forces boarded the yacht.
The guilty pleas are an important step, said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Janice Fedarcyk of the New York Field Office.
"Modern piracy isn't swordplay and derring-do; it's armed robbery and cold-blooded murder at sea. The FBI remains determined to see pirates brought to justice," she said.
U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride said, "If you pirate an American ship, you will be caught and you'll face severe consequences in an American courtroom."
