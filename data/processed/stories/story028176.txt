Outsider Danedream won Europe's most prestigious horse race the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp Sunday in a record time.
Danedream gave Germany only their second win in the race to lead an unusual one-two-three for fillies for the first time since 1983.
The 27-1 shot came home five lengths clear of Shareta, whose stablemate and favorite Sarafina never threatened, with Epsom and Irish Oaks winner Snow Fairy in third.
Danedream's time of two minutes 24.49 seconds for the 2,400m underlined the fast ground at the course in Paris, breaking a record held by Peintre Celebre since 1997.
Her owner breeder Japanese Teruya Yoshida brought the horse for just 9,000 euros ($12,000) as a two-year-old, a remarkably small sum for a future Group One winner.

"I don't believe it, she's the best horse I've ever trained," Danedream's trainer Peter Schiergen told AFP.
He added: "She is a small filly with a big, big heart and there's no better race to win. This is a really big day for German racing."
Jockey Andrasch Starke said: "I was just dreaming in the last two furlongs, that was a great performance."
She is now set to go to the Breeders Cup in the United States to see if the performance can be repeated.
Last year's winner Workforce was never in the reckoning, appearing not to relish the fast ground and was 12th of the 16-runner field while last year's runner-up Nakayama Festa was 11th.
