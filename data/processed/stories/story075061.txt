A 16-year-old boy was charged late Sunday in connection with a shooting at the Bryant Park skating rink that wounded two people, New York City police said.
Corey Dunton was arrested and charged with attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon, and will be charged as an adult, according to New York Police Detective Kelly Ort.
Police believe Saturday's shooting began over an argument about a coat, Ort said.
One victim was shot in the back and the second one in the leg, police said. The victims' injuries are not life-threatening. The victims were 14 and 20 years of age. Police are withholding the victims' names at this time.
Megan Cutcher, a San Francisco resident visiting New York City, was having a drink with relatives at a nearby restaurant when the gunfire started.
"We sat down at one of the outdoor couches with a heater and ordered a drink," Cutcher said. "Right after we ordered, we heard three shots. Initially, it just sounded like a pop gun, but then people started screaming, and we realized it was more serious."
She grabbed her mother and pushed her under the table.
"We were at most 10-15 feet from the ice," she said. "Luckily, the couches we'd been sitting on blocked us from the view of the shooter."
A few minutes later, the gunfire stopped and the restaurant staff ushered them into the kitchen for safety.
"I was able to calm down a bit, though my heart was racing," she said.
Police ordered them to stay put while they searched the area. About an hour later, they got an all-clear to use a particular exit.
