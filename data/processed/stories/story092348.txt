LONDON, England -- French Euro 2008 qualification hopes were dealt a blow on Monday when Bolton striker Nicolas Anelka was ruled out of the critical midweek qualifier against Lithuania in Nantes.
Bolton striker Anelka celebrates his goal in Saturday's 6-0 victory against the Faroe Islands.
Anelka, who has hit 11 goals in 42 international appearances, suffered a thigh injury in Saturday's 6-0 thrashing of the Faroe Islands and has returned to his English Premier League club for treatment.
France must win their final two Group B games -- they complete their program away to Ukraine on November 21 -- if they are to be sure of a place in next year's finals to be jointly hosted by Austria and Switzerland.
Les Bleus are currently in third place one point behind Italy and two points adrift of group leaders Scotland who play in Georgia on Wednesday.
The Italians play in Scotland on November 17 and complete their fixtures at home to the Faroe Islands four days later.
France, meanwhile, are also without five-cap Sevilla defender Julien Escude who has failed to recover from an injury suffered before the weekend win. E-mail to a friend
