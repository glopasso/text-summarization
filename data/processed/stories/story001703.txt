A security guard was killed and five others were injured when a car packed with explosives detonated Saturday in Mogadishu, officials said.
The blast occurred in a seaside restaurant parking lot in the capital, Somali police Col. Ali Hassan told CNN.
No group had claimed responsibility by late Saturday.
The wail of sirens echoed as residents and firefighters rushed to put out flames and smoke from scorched vehicles in the parking lot.
