London, England (CNN)  -- A candidate for the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) was injured Thursday morning in a light plane crash, police said.
Nigel Farage, 45, suffered minor head injuries and was being treated at a hospital, his party said. Details of his injuries were not available.
"We've had unconfirmed reports that either the banner got snagged up or there were cross-winds and it was an unfamiliar airfield to the pilot," a UKIP spokesman said.
It happened just after 8 a.m. (3 a.m. ET) at an airfield in southern Northamptonshire, near the Buckinghamshire constituency where Farage is running for election, Northamptonshire police said.
The pilot, who was airlifted to a hospital, had to be cut out of the plane, the party said.
Farage is currently a member of the European Parliament.
He is running in Buckingham against 10 other candidates: Speaker of the House John Bercow (Conservative); Colin Dale (Monster Raving Loony Party); David Hews (Christian Party); Geoff Howard (Independent); Debbie Martin (Independent); Lynne Mozar (British National Party); Patrick Phillips (Independent); John Stevens (Buckinghamshire Campaign for Democracy); Simon Strutt (Cut The Deficit Party); Anthony Watts (Independent).
