Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett fell off a concert stage and was injured at the end of a show in Sydney, Australia, Wednesday night, according to his manager.
Buffett, 64, spent a day in Sydney's St. Vincent's Hospital, but he was released on Thursday, according to a statement posted on his website.
While the hospital would not release details of his treatment, an announcer on Buffett's Sirius XM channel "Radio Margaritaville" said he received several stitches for a cut to his head.
He misjudged where the stage ended because of footlights, the announcer said.
A video of the incident posted on YouTube shows Buffett closing his concert in Sydney's Hordern Pavilion with his song "Lovely Cruise."
"Thank you, good night and God bless," Buffett told his fans.
After he put his guitar down, Buffett walked toward the cheering crowd with his arms raised.
The video showed the singer taking one step too many, dropping off the front edge of the stage.
Jimmy Buffett and his Coral Reefer Band have performed several sold-out shows in Sydney over the past week, Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper reported.
