When it comes to mandatory education, Puerto Rico and Venezuela stand apart from the rest of the world.
There, children are required to attend school for 14 years. That's longer than any other country -- or commonwealth or territory -- by at least one year, according to the most recent data from UNESCO.
Five places -- Anguilla, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Turks and Caicos Islands -- require 13 years of education. The United States is among a large group that requires 12 years.
Nobody starts a child sooner than Venezuela, which begins by age 3. Puerto Rico starts two years later and ends at 18, which is tied for the highest "ending age" along with Belgium, Germany and Uzbekistan.
At the other end of the spectrum are Bangladesh, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Myanmar and Pakistan, which require only five years of education, according to UNESCO. By age 9, children in Myanmar and Pakistan are already finishing up their legal obligation for school.
Among all of the locations in the table, the average amount of compulsory education is nine years, starting by age 6 and ending near 14.
