(CNN)Singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell has been hospitalized in Southern California.
Paramedics from the Los Angeles Fire Department were called to her home around 2:30 p.m. PT (5:30 p.m. ET) Tuesday on the report of a medical emergency, spokesman Robert Hinojosa said.
"Joni was found unconscious in her home (Tuesday) afternoon. She regained consciousness on the ambulance ride to an L.A. area hospital," according to her official website.
"She is currently in intensive care undergoing tests and is awake and in good spirits. More updates to come as we hear them. Light a candle and sing a song, let's all send good wishes her way."
Some of Mitchell's best-known songs are "Big Yellow Taxi," "Help Me" and "Free Man in Paris," but she has penned hits for other artists too.
Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young scored with her anthem "Woodstock," about the 1969 landmark music festival.
Judy Collins registered a Top 10 hit in 1967 with Mitchell's "Both Sides Now."
Mitchell, 71, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997.
