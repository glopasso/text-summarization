Director-choreographer Adam Shankman has entered a rehab facility, but no details have been made public about what treatment he is seeking.
A representative for the "Hairspray" director and "So You Think You Can Dance" judge confirmed to CNN Tuesday that he was admitted to an undisclosed rehabilitation facility.
His last posting on Twitter came Monday when Shankman posted a red carpet photo with "Glee" stars Jane Lynch and Darren Criss, along with singer Adam Lambert.  The photo was taken Sunday night at the Trevor Live charity event in Hollywood.
Shankman, 49, has three "Glee" episodes on his directing resume.  His film directing credits include "Rock of Ages," "The Wedding Planner" and "A Walk to Remember."
He joined the Fox Network's "So You Think You Can Dance" show as a judge in season three.
