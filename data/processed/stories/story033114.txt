A federal judge pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of drug possession and another charge, admitting he had paid a stripper to buy drugs for the two to use together.
Senior U.S. District Court Judge Jack Camp Jr. admitted to giving money to a woman to buy drugs, according to prosecutors.
He pleaded guilty to two counts of drug possession, federal prosecutors said. He also pleaded guilty to one count of conversion of government property for giving the woman a government-issued laptop.
As part of a plea deal, Camp did not plead guilty to a firearms possession charge included in the initial federal complaint.
The plea came shortly after Camp, 67, retired from the judiciary.
Federal prosecutors accused Camp of giving Sherry Ann Ramos, 26, money to buy drugs including cocaine, marijuana and roxicodone, which the two then frequently used together.
FBI agents arrested Camp on October 1 after he tried to buy drugs from an undercover officer.
Camp's attorneys issued a statement saying the judge took responsibility for his actions and would spend the next several months trying to understand the "uncharacteristic nature of his actions."
He will be sentenced March 4.
