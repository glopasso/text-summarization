(CNN)Looks like tens of thousands of music lovers should be "in the mood for a melody."
Billy Joel, the Piano Man himself, will be headlining this year's Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, the gigantic gathering in Manchester, Tennessee.
British folk rockers Mumford & Sons, electronic superstar Deadmau5, rapper Kendrick Lamar and British indie rockers Florence + the Machine help round out the headline acts.
Other notable performers include My Morning Jacket, Slayer and Earth, Wind & Fire, as well as Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant with his new band, the Sensational Space Shifters.
The full lineup is now listed on the festival's website after being released last night in a distinctly 2015 way. Fans called into a toll-free number to receive a name of one of the bands to share on social media using the #bonnaroo hashtag.
The four-day festival, now in its 14th year, runs from June 11-14 on a 700-acre farm in Manchester, about 60 miles southeast of Nashville. Tickets go on sale Saturday.
