The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned consumers not to eat mamey-flavored ice cream sold under the La Nuestra brand because of potential health risks.
Montalvan's Sales Inc. of Ontario, California, which sells the brand, has voluntarily recalled the product, the FDA said. The ice cream was distributed through retail stores and restaurants in Nevada and California.
In August, the FDA told consumers not to eat frozen mamey fruit pulp after at least nine people in California and Nevada fell ill with typhoid fever.
An investigation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a link between an ongoing attack of Salmonella typhi infections and frozen mamey fruit pulp products. Typhoid fever, which can be fatal, is caused by Salmonella typhi.
"This recall was initiated after Montalvan's Sales, Inc. was notified by FDA and CDC that the affected product was made with La Nuestra Mamey Pulp which was implicated via a strong epidemiologic link to a recent outbreak of Typhoid Fever in several Western States," the FDA said in a statement.
Mamey fruit is a sweet fruit with a fleshy orange pulp. It is grown in the tropical lowlands of Central America, the FDA said, and is used to make juices and smoothies.
