A Palestinian diplomat and his wife were injured in an explosion Wednesday inside their house in the northern Prague neighborhood of Suchdol, officials said.
Police identified the victims as Jamal al Jamal, 57, and his 52-year-old wife.
Al Jamal was taken to Prague Military Hospital, where he was in an induced coma with serious injuries, said Jirina Ernestova, a spokeswoman for Prague Emergency Services.
His wife was taken to Motol Hospital after inhaling smoke and suffering from shock, Ernestova said.
The couple's son, who was also in the house, was not hurt, police said.
