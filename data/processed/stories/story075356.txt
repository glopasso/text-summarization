The "sport of kings" proved a bit tricky this weekend for Britain's Prince Harry, who fell headfirst off his horse during a charity polo match in New York.
The prince, who is third in line to the throne, was sending the ball downfield when he overbalanced. He pitched forward, keeping hold of the reins with one hand while he rolled to land on his backside.
He did not appear to be hurt.
The 25-year-old prince walked backed to his horse and remounted to cheers from the crowd on the baking hot day on Governor's Island.
Harry was playing in the Veuve Clicqout Polo Classic in aid of a charity he co-founded to help AIDS victims in the tiny African nation of Lesotho in South Africa.
Prince Seeiso of Lesotho is the other co-founder of the charity, Sentebale.
Harry, the younger son of Prince Charles and the late Diana, Princess of Wales, has faced more dangerous situations than a charity polo match -- he served for two months as an Army officer in Afghanistan, and is now training to be a military helicopter pilot.
