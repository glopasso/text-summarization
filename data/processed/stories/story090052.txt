A judge has declared a mistrial in the retrial of six men accused of plotting terrorist acts with al Qaeda.
Narseal Batiste, the group's alleged ringleader, testified he wasn't serious about the terrorism threats he made.
The decision comes after 13 days of deliberation and marks the second time government prosecutors have failed to convince a jury that the six defendants were guilty of terror-related charges.
It is unclear whether the government will pursue a third trial against the defendants.
The first trial ended in a mistrial last December after nine days of deliberations left a jury hopelessly deadlocked on the six defendants. A seventh was acquitted.
The defendants are known as the "Liberty City 7" because authorities say the men operated out of a warehouse in Miami's Liberty City housing project.
After their arrests in June 2006, federal officials said the homegrown terror plot may have included as its possible targets the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago -- the tallest building in North America -- as well as the FBI's Miami offices and other sites. E-mail to a friend
