The man accused of killing a Transportation Security Administration officer in a rampage at Los Angeles International Airport was out of the hospital and in the custody of U.S. marshals Tuesday, authorities said.
The suspect, Paul Ciancia, was shot multiple times by police during the November 1 assault. He was released Tuesday morning, the last of those shot to leave the hospital, UCLA Medical Center said.
Ciancia was taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals Service upon his release, said Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.
"No details about his custody status or location are being released at this time," Mrozek told reporters in an e-mail. No court appearances had been scheduled as of Tuesday, he said.
Investigators say Ciancia, 23, killed TSA officer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded two other agents and a passenger in what appeared to be an orchestrated assault on members of the federal agency responsible for airport security. Investigators found information on the suspect expressing not just anti-federal government sentiment but also anger at the TSA specifically, a federal law enforcement official said.
Relatives in New Jersey had received alarming texts from Ciancia before the shootings and raised concerns with local police, who had asked Los Angeles police to check on his welfare. Police missed Ciancia by "a matter of minutes" on the day of the shooting, U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, told CNN.
