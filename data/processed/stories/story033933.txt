Officials on Monday lifted evacuation orders that had sent hundreds of residents fleeing parts of Amarillo, Texas, as two wildfires approached Sunday.
In all, 12 homes were destroyed, they said.
The Pitt Road Fire, on Amarillo's south side, destroyed five homes and eight outbuildings and damaged four other homes, but was 100% contained Monday, said April Phillips with the Texas Forest Service. She estimated the fire burned 150 to 200 acres.
The Stone Ridge Fire, in the north, destroyed seven homes and 11 outbuildings and scorched 1,243 acres, but was fully contained Monday evening, said Tim Evans, a public information officer for the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service. Three people suffered minor injuries, he said.
"We still have quite a few hotspots," he said. "But we do have the fire perimeter surrounded."
Mother Nature was not helping the firefighters. "We're under a red-flag warning today," said Phillips, adding that there was no rain in sight. "It's been, like, months" since the area has had "any significant rain," she said.
The blaze began Sunday afternoon amid what police called "very dry conditions, with zero chance of rain."
The current wildfire season is one of the worst in Texas history. Since it began on November 15, the state has seen 10,896 fires scorch 2.8 million acres, destroying 460 homes in the process, Evans said.
