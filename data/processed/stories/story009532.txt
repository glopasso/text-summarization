Syrian airstrikes on a rebel-held neighborhood in Aleppo on Sunday killed at least 22 people, including 14 children, the Syrian Observatory For Human Rights said in a statement. The SOHR said it expects the death toll to rise, because other people wounded in the attack are in critical condition.
The opposition organization says it's not the first time the Syrian regime has dropped barrels filled with explosives on Aleppo neighborhoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have also been injured.
In addition, more than 2.3 million people have fled Syria, and another 4.25 million Syrians have become refugees within their country since the civil war began, according to an Amnesty International report released on Friday.
