Retired tennis star Pete Sampras has revealed that most of the trophies and memorabilia collected during his 15-year career have been stolen.
Speaking to the Los Angeles Times the former World No.1 said the trophies were stolen from a public storage rental unit.
The missing items include two Davis Cup trophies, an Olympic ring and his first Australian Open title which he won in 1994.
He said his other 13 grand slam trophies are safe, but none of the stolen items were insured.
The seven-time Wimbledon champion told the Los Angeles Times that the items were placed in storage after he had moved homes twice.
Sampras, who retired in 2003, is publicizing the theft which took place three weeks ago in the hope that someone might provide a new lead.
