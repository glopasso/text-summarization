Katniss Everdeen is back.
The trailer for "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I" was released over the weekend at San Diego Comic-Con, and fans couldn't be more ready. Titled "Our Leader the Mockingjay," the trailer is brief but gives the first glimpse of the action in the next installment of the "Hunger Games" franchise.
A rebellion is raging and the trailer lets us know that Everdeen is all in. "Are you fighting, Katniss?" one soldier asks. "Are you here to fight with us?"
Everdeen, played by Jennifer Lawrence, responds, "I am. I will."
Previously, fans of the films -- which are based on a popular young adult series written by Suzanne Collins -- were treated to teasers in the form of two speeches from President Snow (played by Donald Sutherland) and "propaganda" posters released by Lionsgate.
'Hunger Games': The Capitol wants you
The latest "Hunger Games" trailer wasn't the only looksie to generate buzz.. Marvel presented footage from "Avengers: Age of Ultron" at its panel on Saturday along with an appearance by the cast, which included Robert Downey Jr. tossing roses to the crowd as the group entered to the strains of Michael Jackson's "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."
The scene "brought down the house," according to MTV, but Variety reports that the first look at "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" actually attracted more online attention, perhaps bolstered by the release of a photo of the new Wonder Woman and an appearance by stars Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill and Gal Gadot.
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I" is scheduled to be released on November 21 and "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" is expected to be released on May 1 of next year.
