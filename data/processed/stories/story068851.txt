After being lampooned on social media for delaying the start of a debate because his opponent used a fan, Florida Gov. Rick Scott tried to bring the race back to the real issue at stake: Why did former Gov. Charlie Crist need a fan in the first place?
Scott held up the Florida gubernatorial debate on Wednesday for seven minutes after his Democratic rival showed up with an electric fan under his podium.
"I think he was sweating and he needed a fan. I'm surprised he didn't try to ask for dry ice," Scott said Thursday to CNN affiliate WPBF.
That could have actually been a solution to the standoff, because Scott's protest flamed over Crist's apparent disregard for debate rules that banned electronic devices from the stage.
"I think he was probably worried about his track record," Scott said, bringing up his campaign talking point that more than 832,000 people lost their jobs during Crist's four-year term as governor during the Great Recession.
Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, stood on stage alone Wednesday night for the first seven minutes.
"Are we really going to debate a fan?" Crist said Wednesday before his Republican opponent eventually joined him.
But Scott flipped the script on Thursday, saying his opponent nearly didn't make it on stage himself.
"Charlie was throwing a fit, saying he wasn't going to go on stage," Scott said.
Update: An earlier version of this story misstated how many jobs Gov. Rick Scott said were lost in Florida while Crist was governor.
