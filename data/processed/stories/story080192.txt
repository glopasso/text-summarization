Shakira and her boyfriend are expecting a child, the singer announced on her website Wednesday.
"As some of you may know, Gerard (Pique) and I are very happy awaiting the arrival of our first baby! At this time we have decided to give priority to this unique moment in our lives and postpone all the promotional activities planned over the next few days," the 35-year-old singer wrote.
Soccer star Pique, 25, plays for Spain's FC Barcelona.
The entertainer said she was canceling a weekend concert appearance at the iHeartRadio Music Festival in Las Vegas.
"I will not be able to be a part of the iHeartRadio Music Festival," she wrote, "but I'm sure this weekend in Las Vegas will be spectacular and I will be closely following everything that happens there!"
Organizers congratulated Shakira on the festival's website in a post titled "Wow! Shakira reveals pregnancy, must drop out of iHeartRadio Music Festival."
NBC announced this week that Shakira and Usher would soon be sitting in the revolving chairs on the talent contest "The Voice," joining the show's fourth season in the spring as replacements for current coaches Christina Aguilera and Cee Lo Green.
