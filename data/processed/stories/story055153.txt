Musician Ike Turner died of a cocaine overdose, the San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office said Wednesday.
Ike Turner, seen at last year's Grammys, died accidentally, the San Diego County medical examiner says.
"The cause of death for Ike Turner is cocaine toxicity with other significant conditions," Supervising Medical Examiner Investigator Paul Parker told CNN.
Contributing conditions included high blood pressure and emphysema, he said. "The manner of death is an accident," he added.
Turner, who died December 12 at age 76, was perhaps best known for the blues, soul and funk music he and his then-wife Tina performed with the Ikettes during the 1960s and 1970s.
Their hits included "Proud Mary" and "I Want to Take You Higher." E-mail to a friend
