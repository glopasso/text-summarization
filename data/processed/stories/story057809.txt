The collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh last week, which killed more than 500 workers, has highlighted serious issues with safety and poor pay for garment workers in the country.

The garment industry accounts for 77% of Bangladesh's exports -- a $20 billion industry for the nation.
The European Union, Bangladesh's largest trade partner, said Tuesday that it was considering trade action against Bangladesh.

He added they would work with U.S. companies on "improving working conditions, including in Bangladesh."
