Israel launched airstrikes on weapons facilities in Gaza in response to what Israel claimed were two rockets fired against it from the Palestinian territory, the Israeli military said Thursday.
The two Gaza rockets were fired several hours apart Thursday against the Hof Ashkelon Regional Council, where 13,500 residents live, the military said.
Israeli aircraft scored direct hits on a "terror infrastructure" in Gaza, a weapons manufacturing facility in central Gaza and a weapons storage facility in northern Gaza, the military said.
The Israeli military blamed Hamas, which controls Gaza, for the rocket fire.
Thursday's exchange of fire marked another uneasy moment in cease-fire arrangements between Israel and Gaza that were brokered last year when the two sides engaged in eight days of round-the-clock warfare, killing more than 160 Palestinians and six Israelis.
"The manufacturing of rockets in Gaza has no other purpose except to target Israel and its sovereignty putting thousands of lives at risk," Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said in a statement. "We will not tolerate daily aggression from the Hamas ruled territory and are morally obligated to act against those threatening our communities, our towns and our cities."
