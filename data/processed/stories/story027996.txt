The new commander of U.S. forces in Korea stood just feet away from North Korean soldiers on Friday.
Just one day after Gen. James D. Thurman was installed as the head of the United Nations Command/Combined Forces Command/United States Forces Korea, he visited the border between North and South Korea. That area, better known as the DMZ, or Demilitarized Zone, is somewhat ironically named, considering it may be one of the most heavily fortified areas in the world.
As Thurman arrived at the truce village of Panmunjom and entered the building where the armistice that ended the Korean War was signed in 1953, North Korean soldiers, some with binoculars, watched through the windows from their side of the border, behind a simple concrete threshold. They also took photographs -- the usual North Korean response to VIPs visiting the area.
Standing at an observation post overlooking North Korea, the general said, "I thought it very important that I come to the DMZ to observe first-hand the readiness levels and the training and the leadership of the ROK (Republic of Korea) military and U.S. participation so I have a better understanding of the mission."
U.S. and South Korean soldiers briefed Thurman on the security situation there. When asked to characterize the current North Korean threat, Thurman said it was important "to maintain the deterrence" but also expressed hope the threat would diminish some day.
Despite the armistice signing, North and South Korea have been technically at war since 1950, and recent attempts at peace talks have repeatedly failed. Tensions have remained high on the peninsula since North Korea carried out two attacks on the South last year, killing 50 South Koreans.
