Vice President Joe Biden called on Native American leaders to continue fighting what he called an "epidemic" of domestic violence on tribal lands and throughout the United States.
Biden tailored the message of the White House's "It's On Us" campaign against sexual assault to address the disproportionately high rate of domestic violence in Native American communities, emphasizing the need for bystander intervention and community action during the White House Tribal Nations Conference. Native American women face the highest rate of domestic violence and abuse in the U.S.
"It's not about vigilantism, it's about intervening," Biden said. "To me it's the definition of manhood. It's not standing by and saying, 'Well, it's a family affair.'"
Biden's remarks come as tribal authorities prepare to take on new authority in March 2015 to prosecute non-Native Americans who perpetrate domestic violence on tribal lands, which was included in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act last year.
The Vice President emphasized that it's now up to tribal governments to use their new authority to "enforce the law, prosecute and stand for the women who have for too long endured not just injustice, but indifference."
Attorney General Eric Holder, who spoke after Biden at the conference, said already three tribes are part of a pilot program this year that has charged more than 20 non-Indians in domestic violence cases and touted increased collaboration between federal officials and tribal authorities.
Biden spoke passionately about domestic violence and even reenacted calls he said he heard while visiting the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
"The most horrific prison on earth is the four walls of an abused woman's home. And far too many Native American women, for far too many, that's a daily reality," Biden said. "I apologize for it taking so long, so many women damaged in the meantime."
