Vin Diesel has shared an "emotional and bittersweet" peek at "Fast & Furious 7."
On his Facebook page Tuesday, the actor updated fans on the upcoming "Fast & Furious 7" trailer and shared a promotional photo that features Diesel's late co-star, Paul Walker.
Walker, 40, died in a car crash in November, in the midst of filming for "Fast & Furious 7."

In the aftermath of his death, Universal decided to go forward with production and relied on Walker's brothers to help "fill in small gaps" in some action scenes.
Walker starred in the fast-car movies as Brian O'Conner since the franchise's inception in 2001.
Now, with "Fast & Furious 7" on track for a 2015 release, studio Universal is at work on the movie's trailer.
"Universal came to visit, to show the trailer for FF7... Speechless," Diesel posted to Facebook. "Yeah, it was that INCREDIBLE!"

"I must also say that it was emotional and bittersweet," Diesel continued. "We all went above and beyond to make Pablo proud, but man, I wish he could see what we have created and just how far we have come."
"Fast & Furious 7," which also stars Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Jordana Brewster, will open April 3.
