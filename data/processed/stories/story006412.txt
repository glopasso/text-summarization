(CNN)A photography teacher at a Southern California high school appears to have committed suicide by hanging herself in a classroom.
Jillian Jacobson, 31, was found Monday at El Dorado High School, said Lt. Eric Point, with Placentia Police. There was no indication of foul play, and every indication that she took her own life, he said.
According to Steve Concialdi with the Orange County Fire Authority, students had been waiting outside the classroom to get in. Another teacher opened the door.
When they went inside the classroom, they found Jacobson hanged. They quickly brought her to the ground and called 911, said Concialdi, but she was declared dead at the scene.

Students posted tributes to the teacher on social media, saying she would be greatly missed. One called her caring; another said she was a beautiful soul.
Crisis counselors are expected to be on campus all week to support staff and students.
