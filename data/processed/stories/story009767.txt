A Hong Kong judge ordered a wealthy real estate mogul to pay his former wife $154 million in one of the city's largest divorce settlements.
The divorce award translates to HK $1.2 billion and dwarfs famous settlements in other countries.
In comparison, Paul McCartney was ordered to pay Heather Mills almost $50 million three years ago.
Court documents released Thursday detailed a breakdown of the ruling.
It includes a home in the city worth HK $250 million, a London residence valued at HK $30.5 million and HK $2.5 million to buy two cars.
Samathur Li Kin-kan and his wife, Florence Tsang Chiu-wing, married in 2000 and separated in 2008, according to court documents.
They lived a lifestyle "best described as just below that of a US- dollar billionaire," court documents said.
The wife told local media she was "delighted" as she left the courtroom smiling.
