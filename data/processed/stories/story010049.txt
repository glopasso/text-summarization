Recent photos of Lindsay Lohan's teenage sister sparked online speculation over the past week that the 17-year-old Ali Lohan changed her face, which her publicist denied Monday.
"Aliana has never had any type of plastic surgery in her life, nor has she ever considered it," said her publicist, Steve Honig.
Buzz about apparent changes in Lohan's face started on websites including Hollywoodlife.com, which said, "We love Lindsay's little sister, but these shocking photos make it look like her beauty is not all-natural!"
Honig, in a written statement to CNN, said Lohan, who recently signed a modeling contract, has no reason to have plastic surgery.
"Her success as a model lies with her natural looks and she has no interest in changing that," he said.
Honig, however, did not dispute that Ali Lohan's face today is different from when she was younger.
"During the past two years, she has gone through a normal teenage growth spurt that has made her taller and slimmer," he said. "It has also slightly changed the composure of her face, all of which is typical of what happens to kids in their mid to late teens. It's what most people refer to as the awkward stage. Ali is growing up; that's all."
The director Next Model Management, the agency who signed Lohan, told CNN Monday she could "confirm that Aliana Lohan has not had any surgery."
"As a young girl who is growing up, it's natural for her facial features to change slightly, and we see this with many of the younger models we represent," Alexis Borges said. Aliana is a beautiful 17-year-old girl who is growing into her face and body, as is the norm for someone of her age."
Lindsay Lohan, who knows what it's like to be a young target of the tabloids, took to her Twitter account Friday to defend her sister:
"I love how haters pick on my sister yet every runway model is just as thin! My sister is gorgeous and I'm so proud of her and her career!!!!"
