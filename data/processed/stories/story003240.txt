Easter is upon us and, like clockwork, hordes of brightly wrapped chocolate bunnies and eggs have begun their domination of supermarket aisles.
While these sugar-filled options are sure to please the average eater, the true cocoa connoisseur might be left with a craving for something more.
Something better.
This list of the most unforgettable chocolate escapes across the world -- from soothing chocolate spa treatments to a chocolate molding masterclass -- guarantee a delicious Easter getaway.

The real sugar rush comes from the Three Ways' special chocolate indulgence package, which includes a box of handmade chocolates, a chocolate-featured snack, dinner and breakfast, a chocolate treasure hunt and, finally, a chocolate cookery demonstration and tasting.
