(CNN)"Saturday Night Live" cast member Kate McKinnon got rave reviews for her impression of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as she delved into the topic we're all wondering about.
So, what does the fake Clinton have to say about her use of personal email address to conduct government business?
"Those emails are clean as a whistle. This is not how Hillary Clinton goes down," McKinnon's wild-eyed Clinton said, laughing at the idea that the emails would be her undoing.
"There will be no mistakes on my rise to the top -- if I decide to run. Who knows?" she said, throwing her hands in their air.
She offered a peek at her take on "mature romance" by showing a "Happy Anniversary" email to U.S. President Bill Clinton addressed "Dear Sir or Madam."
"SNL" viewers on Twitter thought she nailed Clinton's cool-as-ice demeanor.
