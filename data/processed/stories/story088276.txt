Three coalition service members died after a suicide attack Friday in the Afghan capital of Kabul, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said.
The NAT0-led force said the suicide strike was carried out with a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device. The nationalities of the service members were not immediately available. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
The attack comes two days after two rounds of "indirect fire" struck the U.S. Embassy compound in Kabul, the embassy said. No one was injured in the Wednesday incident. A claim of responsibility was posted on the Taliban's official website.
The violence is occurring during an important juncture in U.S.-Afghan relations. The two countries are working on an important security pact. The deal will lay out the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan after 2014 when the NATO-led force of some 80,000 troops is scheduled to leave.
This month, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Afghanistan and said the security pact will be agreed upon despite a failure so far to forge a deal.
