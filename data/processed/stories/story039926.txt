Federal prosecutors in Washington are seeking to extradite singer Chris Brown from custody in Los Angeles to stand trial for assault, according to court documents obtained by CNN.
Brown, 24, and body guard Christopher Hollosy are facing assault charges stemming from an incident outside the W hotel in October.
A hearing has been set in Los Angeles for Tuesday to consider Chris Brown's status and his extradition to Washington for trial.
The trial in the nation's capital is scheduled for April 17.
Brown is currently locked up in Los Angeles on a probation violation after he was kicked out of a court-ordered drug rehab program.
D.C. prosecutors request that Brown be transferred to U.S. marshals by April 15, according to court documents.
