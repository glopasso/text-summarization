Searchers have found the flight data recorder from an Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed Monday with 90 people aboard, the Lebanese army said Thursday.
The data recorder, commonly called a black box, was found at a depth of about 1,300 meters in the Mediterranean Sea.
The recorder had not yet been retrieved, the army said.
The Boeing 737-800, carrying eight crew members and 82 passengers, crashed into the sea after takeoff from Lebanon early Monday.
At least 14 bodies had been recovered from the crash of the airliner, which was bound for the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, officials said.
The plane crashed about 3.5 kilometers (2 miles) west of the town of Na'ameh, which is 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of Beirut.
Government-owned Ethiopian Airlines is one of the largest carriers in Africa, serving Europe and three other continents.
