(CNN)It's all fun and games in the world of comic book movies -- until pro football gets involved.
Chris Pratt and Chris Evans -- two of the hottest actors in Hollywood because of their superhero roles in recent Marvel Studios movies -- are waging a friendly feud on Twitter, resulting in an epic bet over the Super Bowl.
In one corner, we have "Captain America's" Evans, a dyed-in-the-wool fan of the New England Patriots.
Evans landed the first blow Monday with a tweet to Pratt that said in part, "For the next 2 weeks, you are not my friend, you are my enemy."
In the other corner, we have Pratt, the "Guardians of the Galaxy" star, who roots for the Seattle Seahawks. Pratt quickly fired back with a dig at Evans' Marvel character.
Then Evans upped the ante.
Pratt framed the first half of the bet: If the Patriots lose, Evans must come to Seattle and visit a children's hospital in his superhero duds and waving a Seahawks fan-club flag.
And Evans responded in turn, daring Pratt to come to a Boston pediatric cancer center dressed as Star-Lord from "Guardians."
And so the bet is on. It's always possible that this exchange is a joke or a promotional stunt -- Evans' Captain America co-stars in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," hitting theaters May 1 -- but the Super Bowl just got a little more exciting.
Now Marvel just hopes the two will mend fences after the game on February 1.
