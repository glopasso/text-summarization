One of cable's most popular series is getting a game show spin-off. History is set to announce "Pawnography," a game show version of its long-running hit "Pawn Stars."
The half-hour show will be set in Las Vegas and taped in front of a live studio audience. In each episode, contestants will compete against each other and the "Pawn Stars" cast in rounds of trivia questions that escalate in difficulty. At stake are cash prizes and coveted items from the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawnshop co-owner Rick Harrison's personal collection. In each episode, Rick and Corey Harrison, along with Chumlee Russell, will "vigorously defend their treasured items from confident and brainy contestants."
EW: 'Pawn Stars' gets Cajun spin-off on History
"Pawn Stars" has been a staple on the network since it launched in 2009, ranking as the History's most popular show and as cable's third most-popular unscripted series. The show's ratings once peaked at 7.7 million viewers. History has given "Pawnography" an initial order of 10 episodes and it will premiere this summer.
"We are thrilled to work with Leftfield Pictures on this exciting and challenging new game show that combines the two elements that make 'Pawn Stars' an absolute fan favorite â€” history and the fun, family-dynamic between the Harrison's and Chumlee," said History's senior vp of programming Frontain Bryant in a statement. "This show gives viewers the chance to go head-to-head with the man who knows a little bit about everything, Rick Harrison, and take home treasurable items from the World Famous Gold & Silver Pawnshop."
