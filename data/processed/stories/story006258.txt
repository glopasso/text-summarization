U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Arizona, who was shot in the head in January, reads aloud a portion of her upcoming audio book, her office said Thursday.
Giffords has made what doctors call a miraculous recovery since the shooting at an Arizona supermarket, which left six people dead and 12 others wounded. After months of rehabilitation, she returned to the House floor in August and received a standing ovation.
She has otherwise stayed largely out of the spotlight.
Her book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope," chronicles the relationship between Giffords and her astronaut husband, Mark Kelly. It's the story of her rise to become a Democratic U.S. representative, his stellar career from combat pilot to commander of the Space Shuttle Endeavor's final flight, and the tragedy that befell their lives when she was shot.
The couple wrote the book together with Wall Street Journal columnist Jeffrey Zaslow. Published by Scribner, the book is set for release November 15.
The audio book is scheduled to be released the same day by Simon & Schuster Audio. Kelly reads aloud the whole book except for the final chapter, which is read by Giffords, spokesman Mark Kimble said.

The man charged in the shooting, Jared Loughner, is in mental health treatment and will be re-evaluated early next year to determine his competency to stand trial.
