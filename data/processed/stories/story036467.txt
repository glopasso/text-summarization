Terminally ill singer Etta James was released Thursday from a Southern California hospital, her manager said.
"She is home with her husband and family by her side," said Lupe De Leon. "Her condition remains stable."
James, 73, was hospitalized two weeks, battling the final stages of terminal leukemia and suffering from dementia.
The "At Last" singer spent New Year's Eve watching the ball drop with her sons, Donto and Sametto James, in her hospital room, said Donto James, who played drums in his mother's Roots band for 15 years.
Paul Wright, a lawyer who represents the sons in their dispute with Etta James' husband over who makes decisions for her, said Sunday that the singer is "nearing the end of her time, but she's a tough lady."
The judge overseeing James' conservatorship approved an agreement last month in which husband Artis Mills is the conservator, but he must equally share "end of life" decisions with the sons, Wright said.
Mills is also limited in how much of her estate he can spend and he cannot "encumber her music catalog," Wright said.
