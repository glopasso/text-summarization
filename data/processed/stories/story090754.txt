There's a new "Terminator" on the way -- and this time, he's guarding Sarah Connor.
Entertainment Weekly reports that, as a way of rebooting the successful series, Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 isn't the villain he was in the first film, but closer to the reprogrammed version he was in "Terminator 2: Judgment Day."
And Connor is an orphan who's been raised by T-800 and isn't all that comfortable with the future she's been told about.
"Since she was 9 years old, she has been told everything that was supposed to happen," producer David Ellison told EW. "But Sarah fundamentally rejects that destiny. She says, 'That's not what I want to do.' It's her decision that drives the story in a very different direction."
Emilia Clarke plays Connor and Jai Courtney plays soldier-from-the-future Kyle Reese. In the original "Terminator," from 1984, Reese was sent back in time to defend Connor and ends up the father of the resistance leader he works for, John Connor.
"Terminator: Genisys," the first of a planned trilogy, is due out July 1, 2015.
