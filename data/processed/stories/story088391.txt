Starting Wednesday, openly gay youths will be allowed to join scouting.
Boy Scouts of America made the decision in May to accept them into their ranks.  The resolution took effect when the new year rang in.
More than 60% of the group's 1,400-member national council voted back then at an annual meeting in Grapevine, Texas, for the change.
"No youth may be denied membership in the Boy Scouts of America on the basis of sexual orientation or preference alone," the resolution said.
The BSA, however, will maintain its ban on gay adult leaders.
