Lyon have reached agreement with French league rivals Bordeaux to sign French international playmaker Yoann Gourcuff for a fee of 22 million euros.
The 24-year-old, who was sent off for France against hosts South Africa at the World Cup finals and has won 24 caps for his country, will sign a long-term contract with the former champions.
Lyon midfielder Jean Makoun told reporters that the club's players were excited by Gourcuff's arrival at the club. "His signing demonstrates the ambition we have.
"He has a lot of technical qualities. He is a player who can be decisive in extra time and in the final pass. Sometimes we have trouble in these areas.
"With him we're hoping to get to the next level and recapture the title," he added.
Meanwhile, Juventus are reported to have made a move to sign Italy forward Antonio Di Natale from Udinese.
Italian news agency Ansa have claimed the Turin club have offered seven million euros for the 32-year-old.
However, the player himself has distanced himself from reports, telling local media: "I've been here seven years and I want to stay here, I don't know anything about a transfer."
In other transfer news, West Ham striker Alessandro Diamanti has completed his return to Italy, signing for newly-promoted Serie A side Brescia.
The 27-year-old failed to become a regular for the English Premier League side after joining from Livorno last year -- and has now gone back to Italy for a fee in the region of 2.2 million euros.
