A passenger train rumbling through the Czech Republic slammed into a collapsed overpass, causing the deaths of at least a half dozen passengers and the injuries of a few dozen more, according to a Czech News Agency account.
An areal view shows the scene of the train accident in Studenka, 360 kilometers east of Prague.
The EuroCity train, which was traveling about 140 kilometers, or 87 miles, an hour at the time of the accident, crashed around 10:30 a.m. near the Czech town of Studenka.
It had been headed from the Polish city of Krakow to the Czech Republic capital of Prague, and was carrying people who were planning to attend an Iron Maiden rock concert, the state-run news agency said.
Officials said the engine and its six passenger carriages derailed when part of a bridge under construction fell down as the train approached.
At least six people were killed and 41 others were injured, officials said. Initial estimates said 10 people were killed and around 100 were injured.
Zdenek Nytra, head of Moravian-Silesian firefighters, said rescuers extricated all survivors, according to the agency.
