At least 60 people were killed and dozens more injured in Iraq on Wednesday during a wave of bombings and shootings, police told CNN.
Most of the deaths occurred in Baghdad, where eight car bombs and two roadside bombs detonated in mostly Shiite areas. At least 54 people in the Iraqi capital died in strikes at an outdoor market, outside a coffee shop, near a Shiite mosque, inside a bus station, and at other locations.
Sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shiites and political unrest have festered in recent months. In September alone, nearly 1,000 people were killed in violence across Iraq, according to the United Nations.
