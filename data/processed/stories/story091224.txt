(CNN)  -- Inter Milan beat African underdogs TP Mazembe 3-0 to win FIFA's Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi on Saturday.
First half goals from Goran Pandev and Samuel Eto'o and a late strike from substitute Jonathan Biabiany sealed victory for the European champions at the Zayed Sport City Stadium.
Congolese side Mazenbe had shocked Internacional of Brazil in the semifinals but found themselves outclassed by the Serie A champions.
The win will take a little of the pressure off Inter manager Rafael Benitez, whose side are trailing arch rivals AC Milan in the Italian title race this season.
Inter took the lead after 14 minutes when Pandev was found by Eto'o with the Macedonian scoring neatly.
With three minutes, Inter had extended their advantage after Javier Zanetti's cut-back found Cameroon star Eto'o to fire home.
Mazembe goalkeeper Muteba Kidiaba, one of the stars of their passage to the final, came to the rescue with two fine saves to deny Diego Milito as Inter looked to kill the game off for good.
But Mazembe had few chances, the best falling to Dioko Kaluyituka, who saw a first half stoppage time volley blocked by Ivan Cordoba and was denied by Julio Cesar with time running out.
Maicon hit the post for Inter after the break but sealed victory as Biabiany run on to a through ball to score the third with five minutes left.
Earlier, South American champions Internacional took third place with a 4-2 win over Seongnam Ilhwa Chunma of South Korea with Alecsandro scoring twice.
