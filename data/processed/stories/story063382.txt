Claudio Marchisio's late double gave Juventus a 2-0 win over reigning champions AC Milan Sunday to go back to the top of the Serie A standings.
The game in Turin looked set to end in a draw until Marchisio scored three minutes from time then added a late second to seal three points which put Juve ahead of Udinese on goal scored.
Defeat continued Milan's poor start to the campaign and they lanquish in 15th, two places and a point ahead of arch-rivals Inter.
Juventus created a number of openings to break the deadlock but with the clock counting down made the breakthrough.
Marchisio went for a one-two with Mirko Vucinic but in trying to intercept Milan's Daniele Bonera only succeeded in slamming the ball onto Marchisio's foot and into the net.
In injury time, Marchisio beat Christian Abbiati with a long range strike which the goalkeeper should have saved.
Earlier, Udinese kept pace with a 2-0 win over Bologna as Mehdi Benatia gave them the lead on 29 minutes.
Captain Antonio Di Natale scored the second from the penalty spot after Pablo Armero had been fouled.
Napoli are a point behind in third following a fine 3-0 win at 10-man Inter Saturday.
Meanwhile in the German Bundesliga Sunday, coach Huub Stevens made a winning start for Schalke as they won 2-1 at Hamburg.
Klaas Jan Huntelaar opened the scoring after 13 minutes only for Mladen Petric to level seven minutes before the break.
Dutch ace Huntelaar grabbed the winner with 17 minutes left.
In the other match played, Werder Bremen failed in their bid to join Bayern Munich at the top of the table as they were beaten 3-2 by Hanover.
Mohammed Abdellaoue scored a hat-trick for Hanover, who held on despite a late Claudio Pizarro goal for Bremen.
