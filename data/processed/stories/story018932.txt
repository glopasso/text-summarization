The four Georgia teens accused in the beating death of a fifth teen at a house party appeared in court on murder charges Monday morning.
Horace Damon Coleman, 19, Emanuel Benjamin Boykins, 18, Quantez Devonta Mallory, 18, and Tracen Franklin, 19, face one felony murder count each, according to Lt. Bruce Ferguson with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.
They are accused of killing Bobby Maurice Tillman, 18, at a house party in metro Atlanta early Sunday. Officials said the party got out of control.
A judge at their initial hearing ordered no bail for the suspects until they can speak with an attorney.
All but Franklin asked for court-appointed counsel. His mother told the judge she had already hired an attorney for her son.
Before the attack, one of the teens reportedly told his friends he was going to hit the next person he saw, Ferguson said.
Sheriff Phil Miller told CNN affiliate WSB the assault on Tillman was unprovoked. He was a "little guy, 18 years old, 5-foot-6, weighed 125 pounds," Miller said about the victim.
"And they beat him up and stomped him and killed him," he added.
Police arrived on scene early Sunday. They were called by the mother of the girl who had hosted the party, Ferguson said. Police took 57 witnesses in for questioning.
Ed Stephens, who lives near where the party took place, watched the brutal attack from his bedroom window, WSB reported.
"I just thought he was hurt. I never thought that his life was ending," Stephens said.
CNN's Chuck Johnston and Tristan Smith contributed to this report.
