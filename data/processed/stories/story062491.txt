Australia hold a slender 30-run advantage over South Africa after the second day of the second Test in Johannesburg, despite another dramatic batting collapse on Friday.
The visitors, who were skittled out for an embarrassing 47 on their way to losing the first Test in Cape Town by eight wickets, began their innings brightly as an opening stand of 174 between Shane Watson and Phil Hughes looked to have given them a sturdy foundation for a big score.
But, in reply to the home side's total of 266, Australia collapsed once again, losing all 10 wickets for just 122 runs as they finished on 296 all out.

Pick of the South African bowlers was paceman Dale Steyn -- who took four for 64 -- while leg-spinner Imran Tahir mopped up three wickets towards the end of the innings, his first in Test cricket.
Both Watson and Hughes scored 88 but, apart from an impressive 38 not out from Mitchell Johnson, not one other Australian scored above 20, leaving the match finely poised going into the third day.
Bad light ended proceedings early, with South Africa failing to score from the four balls they faced.
"It didn't go our way this morning, so we had to reassess things and after that the bowlers came out and did a great job," Steyn told reporters.
Meanwhile, Former Pakistan players Salman Butt and Mohammed Amir will begin their appeals against their jail sentences for spot- fixing next Wednesday.
Former captain Butt was imprisoned for 30 months and teenage pace bowler Amir was handed a six-month term for bowling deliberate no-balls against England in August 2010.
A third player, Mohammad Asif, was jailed for a year but has not appealed against his conviction.
