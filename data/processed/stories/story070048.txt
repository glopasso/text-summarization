Kanye West is a suspect in a misdemeanor battery assault probe in Beverly Hills, police said Monday.
The alleged battery happened near Wilshire Boulevard at 12:15 p.m. Monday, a Beverly Hills Police Department statement said.
"Mr. West had left the location prior to officers arrival," police said. "As of this writing, BHPD Detectives are conducting a follow-up investigation."
Representatives for West did not immediately respond to CNN calls for comment.
The police statement gave few other details.
"The named suspect was identified as Kanye West by the victim and several witnesses," police said.
West already faces charges of battery and attempted grand theft in an altercation with a photographer at Los Angeles International Airport last summer.
Photographer Daniel Ramos flagged down police and said he was taking photos of an "individual" when the suspect attacked him.
West's lawyer, Blair Berk, entered a not guilty plea on West's behalf in court in November. The case is set for another hearing on January 23.
Rob Wilcox, spokesman for the Los Angeles city attorney's office, said each of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail.
