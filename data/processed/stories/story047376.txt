Millionaires are ready for Hillary.
According to a CNBC survey, Hillary Clinton -- with 31% support -- would be the top choice for people with "investable assets of $1 million or more" if the 2016 election were held today.
Clinton is followed by former Republican Gov. Jeb Bush with 18%, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie with 14% and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders  with 11%.
In the poll, CNBC notes that "people with investable assets of $1 million or more" make up the top 8% of American households and their poll was "evenly split between Democrats, Republicans and Independents."
Among Democrats, Clinton's lead is massive, with 72% of the 500 people polled stating they support the former first lady. Bush, likewise, is the top choice for Republican millionaires with 36% support.
Despite the fact that millionaire supporters have outsized influence because of campaign contributions and donations to super PACS, this distinction could be one Clinton doesn't want.
Since she last ran 0for president, the Democratic Party has become more populist and in order to win in 2016, many political experts see her needed to reconnect with middle and working class voters. The party has also been overtaken by skepticism of Wall Street and, in some cases, wealth, meaning having the backing of a majority of millionaires may not be a badge of honor in 2016.
What's more, the support of more millionaires has not always been indicative of electoral success. In 2008 and 2012, Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney had support of most millionaires in their respective elections. Both went on to lose to President Barack Obama, who had the support of most people with $30 million or more.
