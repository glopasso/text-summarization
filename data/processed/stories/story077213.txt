Formula One's mid-season break may have only just begun, but McLaren's Lewis Hamilton says he "can't wait" for the competition to resume in Belgium later this month.
The British team have tasted victory in the last two rounds of the world championship, with Hamilton, 26, taking the checkered flag in Germany and his compatriot and teammate Jenson Button claiming maximum points in Hungary last weekend.
Despite their recent form, McLaren are still some way behind Red Bull and their reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel, who currently leads the drivers' standings and is 88-points clear of Hamilton in third position.
"Off the back of two consecutive wins is a great way to go into the summer break," the 2008 champion Hamilton told his official web site.
Button: Red Bull should be worried
"Everyone is now having an important and well-deserved rest and we'll be ready to come back fighting in Belgium.
"We're in a strong position and we will be working hard to maximize that speed when we get back. There are 200 points up for grabs and I enter all of the races believing I can win them. I can't wait for it to get started again."
Hamilton, who has registered two wins so far this season, led for large parts of Sunday's Hungaroring race and battled for first place with Button before slumping to a fourth place finish.
But the Stevenage-born driver insists the competition between the two is healthy for the team.

"Jenson is a great teammate and a great driver. He drove a fantastic race on Sunday and he deserved the win.
"We pushed each other hard as we always do and always will. This sport is all about pushing the limits, and having a teammate that challenges you is part of that."
Hamilton and Button will next take to the track for the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa on August 28.
