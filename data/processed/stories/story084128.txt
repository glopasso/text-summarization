About 390,000 customers in the greater Chicago area were without power early Tuesday morning following massive storms that moved through the area a day earlier.
Full restoration could take several days, said Judy Rader, a spokeswoman with the ComEd utility company.
The swift, severe thunderstorms that wiped out power in Illinois on Monday also killed a 38-year-old man in Michigan when a tree in his backyard fell onto the garage where he and his family had sought shelter, officials said.
The man's wife and six children were unhurt, the Kent County, Michigan, Sheriff's Department said.
Across Michigan, about 96,000 customers were without power Monday evening, said Tim Pietryga, spokesman for Consumers Energy.
CNN's Maria White contributed to this report.
