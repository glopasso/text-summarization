A Syrian soldier was killed in the restive city of Baniyas on Thursday, Syria's official news agency said.
But an activist says he is hearing that the soldier was shot by a secret police sniper in an effort to frame demonstrators in the city.
"An armed group of snipers opened fire today on a number of elements in the army while they were patrolling in the city of Baniyas," the Syrian Arab News Agency said.
The slain soldier was identified as Fadi Issa Mustafa. Another identified as Tayseer Omran, was wounded by a "criminal group," the news agency said.
Activist Rami Nakhle said a doctor in Baniyas claimed that police shot the soldier.
The incident comes as the army has been sent in to replace the secret police and establish order, a move welcomed by many Baniyas residents.
Residents are claiming that the secret police have been firing on the government's own security apparatus to paint the demonstrators as violent, Nakhle said.
The developments reported by eyewitnesses and state media reports in Syria cannot be independently confirmed.
Protests against the Syrian regime have swept through the country and scores of people have died in clashes. Demonstrations have erupted lately in Baniyas, a city of about 40,000 on the Mediterranean coast.
Opposition activists say security forces have fired on and beaten peaceful protesters, but the government claims that armed groups are firing at security forces and citizens.
