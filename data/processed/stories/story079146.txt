Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has admitted he is considering bringing goalscoring legend Thierry Henry back to the club on a short-term loan deal.
The 34-year-old Henry, who is Arsenal's record all-time scorer with 226 goals for the club between 1999 and 2007, currently plays for MLS side New York Red Bulls, and does not need to return to the United States until March.
Wenger is facing a shortage of strikers with Ivorian Gervinho and Moroccan Marouane Chamakh both appearing for their countries in the Africa Cup of Nations in January and February -- and Henry's return could be a viable solution to the problem.
Wenger told the official Arsenal website: "I have to think about it. Short-term is ideal for us, but I haven't made any enquiry yet. Thierry is not with the club at the moment and it has never come up in any conversation.
He added: "January 1 is the vital date for us and I will make a decision in the next seven days on players."
Frenchman Henry, who recently had a spell back training with the club, had a statue of himself unveiled outside the Emirates Stadium earlier this month as part of Arsenal's 125-year centenary celebrations.
In his eight years at Arsenal, Henry won two English Premier League titles and three FA Cups, before being sold to Barcelona in 2007.
