Federal, state and local authorities investigating the deaths of two Texas prosecutors executed a search warrant Friday afternoon at the home of a former Kaufman County justice of the peace, an FBI spokeswoman said.
Katherine Chaumont told CNN that an FBI team was part of the Friday afternoon search at the home of Eric Williams.
Williams last year was convicted of burglary and theft by a public servant, and was sentenced to two years' probation.
Mark Hasse, chief felony prosecutor in the county, was gunned down January 31 outside the courthouse. Hasse prosecuted the Williams case.
Hours after Kaufman County District Attornney Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found dead March 30 at their Forney home, investigators met at a local Denny's restaurant with Williams, his attorney told CNN earlier this month.
Investigators took swab samples from Williams' hand to test him for gun residue, Williams' attorney, David Sergi, said. Results were not made public by authorities but Sergi said the tests were negative.
On Friday, Sergi released a statement saying that Williams "has cooperated with law enforcement and vigorously denies any and all allegations. He wishes simply to get on with his life and hopes that the perpetrators are brought to justice."
Earlier this month, Williams told North Texas TV station KXAS he understood why authorities would want to meet with him after the McLellands' death.
"If I was in their shoes, I would want to talk to me," Williams said. "In the investigators' minds, they want to check with me to do their process of elimination."
Williams said he has cooperated with law enforcement.
"I certainly wish them the best in bringing justice to this incredibly egregious act," he said.
Williams told the station he has no ill will toward prosecutors, saying they were "doing their jobs."
