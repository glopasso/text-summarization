(EW.com) -- FX has greenlit a single-camera pilot called "The Comedians" that will star Billy Crystal as a veteran joke-teller who is paired with a younger and edgier performer for a late-night sketch show.
The pilot, which will begin shooting this summer, is based on a Swedish format of the same name from Stockholm-based Efti AB.
