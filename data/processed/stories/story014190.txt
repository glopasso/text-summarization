He is charged with "arson and related offenses" in connection with at least nine of the fires. Among them was a spree that destroyed 15 homes in late January,
His bail was set at $9 million.
Special agent Mark Porter of the multi-agency task force that has been investigating the fires said the group is still investigating the other blazes and will "continue our efforts until everyone is brought to justice ... and we can bring some sense of peace to the city."
The task force would not comment on a possible motive, but Carroll said he does not suspect Barlow of a hate crime, classified as targeting an individual group or gang-related activity.
