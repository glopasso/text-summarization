An American Airlines plane flying from Costa Rica to Miami made an emergency landing on Colombia's San Andres Island Thursday, the airline said.
The airline said a "mechanical issue" was behind the pilot's decision to divert the flight to the island, located on Colombia's north coast.
CNN affiliate Caracol TV reported that smoke was seen in the cabin.
Flight 1204 was carrying 172 passengers and six crew, American Airlines said.
The passengers disembarked while the aircraft, a Boeing 757, was evaluated.
No one was injured, Caracol reported.
