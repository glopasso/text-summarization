(CNN)It's a hard-knock life, Jay Z, especially on Twitter.
The uber private rapper/entrepreneur broke out of his usually reserved social media shell over the weekend to defend the performance of his new music streaming service, Tidal.
Using the hashtag #TidalFacts, he attempted to refute talk that the company has been doing a less than stellar job in taking on competitor Spotify.
He launched the subscription-based music service last month with a star-studded  news conference in which artists such as Madonna, Kanye West, Daft Punk and Jay Z's wife, Beyonce, came together in support of what singer Alicia Keys told the crowd was "The first ever artist-owned global music and entertainment platform."

But less than a month after its debut, there's been chatter that the service is underwhelming, and Jay Z's "stream of consciousness" tweets denying that were met with some derision.
And, of course, a Tidal Facts parody Twitter account was quickly created to offer some "facts" of its own.
