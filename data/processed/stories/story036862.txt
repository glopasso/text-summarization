Customers of Dish Network's satellite television service were unable to access many channels on Tuesday.
The nationwide outage was caused by a "satellite anomaly," a Dish spokesman told CNN. Affected service was limited in many cases to high-definition service, he said.
Technicians worked overnight to resolve the problem and expect service to be restored by tomorrow morning, the spokesman said. Another spokesman said Wednesday that the issues had been resolved on schedule and that the outage wasn't major.
Tom Tait, a Dish customer who lives in Santa Clarita, California, said he had trouble getting through to telephone support lines and accessing the company's website. Dish was actively responding to customers from its Twitter account.
The company has about 14 million subscribers to its satellite TV network. Dish is currently expanding the scope of its business, having recently acquired Blockbuster in a bankruptcy auction for $320 million and is moving into mobile data services.
