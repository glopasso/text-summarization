Spain's royal family publicly revealed its finances for the first time Wednesday, as the nation faces an economic crisis and corruption allegations bring increased scrutiny to the monarchy.
King Juan Carlos receives 292,752 euros ($382,743) annually, the royal palace said in a statement. Prince Felipe, next in line to the throne, receives about half that amount
Queen Sofia, Princess Letizia, Infanta Elena and Infanta Cristina received a combined total of 375,000 euros for royal duties ($490,274) in 2011, the palace's statement said.
The announcement comes as a corruption investigation reportedly involving the king's son-in-law has fueled public criticism of the royal family.
Authorities are investigating whether a foundation headed by Inaki Undangarin improperly used public funds, according to media reports. No charges have been filed against Undangarin, a former Olympic handball player who married Infanta Cristina in 1997.
Urdangarin's attorney, in an interview with Europa Press earlier this month, said his client was innocent.
The palace pledged its commitment to austerity and transparency in its statement Wednesday.
