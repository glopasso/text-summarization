(RollingStone.com) -- "Glee" creator Ryan Murphy is reportedly Sony Pictures' top pick to direct the forthcoming remake of the musical "Annie" starring Willow Smith.
The movie is being produced by Smith's parents Will and Jada Pinkett Smith and their partners in a joint venture with Jay-Z.

Though it's too early to tell whether Murphy will be interested in the project, much less have the time for it given his schedule as the executive producer of "Glee," Sony's offer cements him as Hollywood's top man for musicals.
He's already been courted by Fox to remake the "Rocky Horror Picture Show" and Universal to make a film adaptation of the Broadway hit "Wicked."
