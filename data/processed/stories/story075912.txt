A supersonic combat jet crashed Saturday afternoon on a training complex in rural Nevada, the Navy said.
The F/A-18C Hornet went down about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada, an hour's drive east of Reno.
The aircraft was conducting a training flight. Navy personnel were en route to the scene Saturday night and had not yet "confirmed the status of the aircraft crew member," according to a news release.
The plane was assigned to the air station's Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center.
Naval Air Station Fallon is a popular training site because of its weather, which provides "more than 300 clear flying days per year" and its facilities, which include four bombing ranges, an electronic warfare range and a 14,000-foot runway, the longest in the Navy, the station's website says.
