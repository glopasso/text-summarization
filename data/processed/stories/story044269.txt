A manhunt is under way in New Jersey as multiple law enforcement agencies search for Arthur E. Morgan III, who is wanted for questioning in the death of a two-year-old girl, authorities said.
The girl is believed to be Morgan's biological daughter.
A group of boys discovered the child's body partially submerged in a stream in Shark River Park in Monmouth County on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
She was still strapped in her car seat, CNN afffiliate WABC reported.
The stream runs directly beneath an overpass, suggesting the child and car seat were thrown from the overpass, said county prosecutor Christopher Gramiccioni.
Morgan was supposed to return the child to her mother Monday night following a custody visit, Gramiccioni. When he failed to return the child, prosecutors in Ocean County charged him with endangering the welfare of a child and interfering with child custody Tuesday morning.
The child was found dead some 20 hours later, WABC reported.
A number of federal and state agencies, including the FBI, are involved in the search, suggesting Morgan may try to leave New Jersey where he and the child's mother live separately, Gramiccioni said.
