The controversy over the Internal Revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status is back in the headlines with two hearings this week.
The House Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services held a hearing Monday where the Treasury inspector general for the IRS testified and Daniel Werfel, the embattled agency's new acting commissioner, appeared before Congress for the first time since taking over the agency at President Barack Obama's request. Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee will hear from groups who say they were targeted.
