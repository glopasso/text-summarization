North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's hair is no laughing matter. Not for the country's embassy employees in London, at least.
Chalk it up to British humor when London barbers hung a poster in their shop of Kim and his signature hairstyle: a longer top, with the sides of his head shaved.
The barbers don't consider that cut too appealing. So they used Kim's hair to try to drum up business for their M&M Hair Academy.
"Having a bad hair day?" asks the sign, which features an image of Kim. "15% off all men's haircuts through the month of April from Tuesday to Thursday."
The day after the sign went up, two men in suits entered the barber shop and confronted the manager, according to the manager's son, Karim Nabbach, 26.
The two men weren't laughing. They told manager Mo Nabbach, "We are North Koreans, and that is our leader on your poster," Karim Nabbach said.
The two men apparently worked at the nearby North Korean Embassy.
Mo Nabbach refused to give his name and told them to get a lawyer if they had a problem. He asked them to leave. The manager then reported the incident to police in case anything happened to his shop, Karim Nabbach said.
Police acknowledged the dispute between the North Koreans and the barbers over what is -- and isn't -- bad hair. They even looked into the matter, but they found no crime.
"We have spoken to all parties involved, and no offence has been disclosed," a spokesman for Scotland Yard said.
Calls to the North Korean Embassy in London for comment went unanswered.
