Emblazoned with a red Iron Cross and calling itself "2083: A European Declaration of Independence," the 1,518-page manifesto alleged to have been written by the suspect in shootings and bombings that left at least 92 people dead in Norway rambles from ways that "Justiciar Knights" can avoid detection by police to relatives' sexually transmitted diseases.
Here are key points from the document, which CNN has not independently confirmed was written by suspect Anders Behring Breivik:
--The writer describes himself as "Justiciar Knight Commander for Knights Templar Europe and one of several leaders of the National and pan-European Patriotic Resistance Movement."
--He anticipates a European civil war taking place in three stages, ending in 2083 with the execution of cultural Marxists and the deportation of Muslims.
--The first stage runs through 2030 and includes "open source warfare, military shock attacks by clandestine cell systems (and) further consolidation of conservative forces."
--Between 2030 and 2070, the author predicts "more advanced forms of resistance groups (and the) preparation for pan-European coup d'etats."
--The final stage -- when the author anticipates Europe being 30%-50% Muslim by country -- features the "execution of cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ... traitors," deportation of Muslims and "implementation of a Cultural Conservative political agenda" following the overthrow of existing governments across the continent.
--The author says he personally has been attacked repeatedly by Muslims: "I've 'only' experienced 8 assaults, attempted robberies and multiple threats. I've never actually been severely ravaged, robbed or beaten my Muslims (a broken nose is the worst thing that occurred) but I know more than 20 people who have. I know at least 2 girls that have been raped my Muslims and I am familiar with two more cases in my broader network (1 gang rape). One girl though was cut badly in the face by Muslims."
--He lists accused Bosnian Serb genocide suspect Radovan Karadzic among the people he would like to meet, denying that Karadzic is "a mass murderer and a racist," saying instead that "for his efforts to rid Serbia of Islam he will always be considered and remembered as an honourable Crusader and a European war hero."
--The author accuses Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and his Labour Party of perpetuating "cultural Marxist/multiculturalist ideals" and indoctrinating youth with those ideals.
--"The situation is just chaotic," the author writes, noting that "thousands of Muslims" are coming into his country annually. "These suicidal traitors must be stopped," the author writes.
--The manifesto speculates about what would happen if the author were to survive "a successful mission and live to stand a multiculturalist trial.... When I wake up at the hospital, after surviving the gunshot wounds inflicted me, I realize at least for me personally, I will be waking up to a world of shit, a living nightmare. Not only will all my friends and family detest me and call me a monster; the united global multiculturalist media will have their hands full figuring out multiple ways to character assassinate, vilify and demonize."
--The author says he prefers fantasy video role-playing games to ones where the player sees through the eyes of someone shooting enemies, writing: "I'm generally more the fantasy RPG kind of person -- Dragon Age Origins etc. and not so much into first person shooters."
--The author states that he was moved to action dating to "my government's involvement" in NATO's 1999 strikes during the Kosovo campaign, claiming this wrongly targeted "our Serbian brothers (who) wanted to drive Islam out by deporting the Albanian Muslims back to Albania."
--"Be extra careful when researching for bomb schematics (fertilizer bombs), as many terms will trigger electronic alerts," he writes, one of several tips that include using an "anonymous laptop and browse free to your local McDonalds" in order to "avoid ending up on any watch list."
--Besides hands-on instructions, the document also functions as a running diary. It also includes references to his relatives' sexual indiscretions, entries on some of his friends' personal lives, and his own off-and-on steroid use.
--From July 2 on, though, the author becomes more business-like and complains that going off his testosterone supplements had ramped up his "aggressiveness." He then digs up his guns and prepares the bombs. It all leads up to July 22, the date of the attacks.
"The old saying 'if you want something done, then do it yourself' is as relevant now as it was then," he writes. "In many cases; you could do it all yourself, it will just take a little more time. AND, without taking unacceptable risks."
--The last entry is dated the day of the attack: "I believe this will be my last entry. It is now Fri July 22nd, 12.51."
