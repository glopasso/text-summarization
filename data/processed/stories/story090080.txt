The vanishing spray used by referees at the recent FIFA World Cup has found a new home in the English Premier League.
The biodegradable foam, which provides a visual 10-yard marker at free kicks to stop defenders encroaching, will make its debut in the 2014/15 season.
"At the Premier League we are open to developments that enhance the competition and it was clear from watching the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil that Vanishing Spray benefited referees, players, and all of those who watched the matches," Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in a statement.
The move follows consultations with both Premier League clubs and referees.
The spray will be used for the first time in the match between Manchester United and Swansea City at Old Trafford on August 16.
Mike Riley, general manager of the Premier League refereeing body -- the Professional Game Match Officials Limited -- welcomed the idea.
"As an assessor at the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil I saw firsthand the benefits of Vanishing Spray for referees, and for the game as a whole," Riley said in a statement.
"The Select Group referees are looking forward to using it during Barclays Premier League matches next season."
The spray, which proved a hit with players, fans and officials at Brazil 2014, has been used in Major League Soccer (MLS) for several years.
