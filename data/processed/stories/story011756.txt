Englishman Oliver Fisher earned his maiden European Tour victory with a two-stroke success in the Czech Open in Ostrava on Sunday.
The 22-year-old, who turned professional at 18 after becoming the youngest-ever Briton to earn a place on the European Tour in 2006, carded a final round three- under-par 69 for a total of 275 (-13).
Halfway leader Mikael Lundberg of Sweden also posted a 69 to finish clear in second place, while Paraguay's Fabrizio Zanotti recorded a superb final round 66 to finish third another two shots behind the winner.
Fisher had started the final round level with Scotland's Steven O'Hara at the top of the leaderboard, but O'Hara slumped to a closing 75 as Fisher held off the challenge of Lundberg -- securing victory with a superb 25-foot birdie putt on the par-five 17th hole.
The victory came as something of a surprise after Fisher missed 20 of his first 21 cuts this season, although he had shown some improvement in recent events in Sweden and Ireland.
"Getting your first win is obviously special, especially as I've struggled so far this season. My form has been horrific, but golf's a funny game," Fisher told the official European Tour website.
"I went through a lot of different emotions out there today. I hit it well on the range this morning, so that gave me confidence," added Fisher.
Meanwhile, Webb Simpson fired a six-under-par 64 to claim a two-shot lead after three rounds of the Wyndham Championship in Greensboro, North Carolina.
Simpson, who hails from North Carolina, lies on a 15-under-par total of 195 to hold an advantage over halfway leader Tommy Gainey, who posted a 69.
