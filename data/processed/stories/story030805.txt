Get your dance shoes on. Korean singer Psy, who became a worldwide sensation with his smash hit "Gangnam Style," is making another attempt at a global phenomenon.
He performs his sequel, "Gentleman," live for the first time Saturday, hoping to avoid the fate of other one-hit wonders.
His video for "Gangnam Style" was the most viewed clip on YouTube with a staggering 1.5 billion views -- and growing.
More than 50,000 fans are expected to pack Seoul's World Cup Stadium on Saturday to see "Gentleman," a performance that will be streamed live on YouTube.
The concert comes against a backdrop of increasing tension in the region amid North Korea's belligerent rhetoric and nuclear threats. But it's business as usual for many in Seoul.
Neither the government nor concert organizers are concerned about any additional security measures for such a massive gathering, and tickets have been selling fast.
"The thought of danger never even occurred to me," said Seoul resident Sungoh Bang, who plans on attending the concert with a group of friends.
"Gentleman" and "Psy" were two of the most searched for keywords on South Korea's biggest online portal, Naver, on Thursday, as Psy posted a snippet of his new dance.
But fans and critics eager to see the rapper's new video in full will have to wait longer.
"We wrapped the music video shoot on Tuesday, and its in the editing phase right now," YG Entertainment public relations representative Hwang Min-hee told CNN. "It's rather difficult to say when it will be released because we don't know how long the editing will take."
The music video was produced by the same team behind "Gangnam Style," and will feature K-pop girl group member Ga-In of Brown Eyed Girls.
The choreographer behind the famed horse dance also dreamed up the moves for "Gentleman."
