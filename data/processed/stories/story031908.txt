Steve McPherson quit his job as ABC Entertainment president this week amid "gossip and innuendo" that "goes with the territory," his lawyer said Thursday.
The network confirmed McPherson's resignation, but would not comment on what McPherson attorney Tom Hoberman described as the "rumors of internal situations" at ABC.
McPherson held the post for six years and had another year on his contract.
"Upon Steve McPherson returning to work from his vacation on Monday, he made a voluntary decision to resign and ABC accepted his resignation," Hoberman said in a written statement.
The statement only hinted at what led to his decision to suddenly depart just days before the network was set to present its fall primetime lineup to television critics.
"It is not uncommon for high level executives to be the subject of gossip and innuendo," Hoberman said. "That would include rumors of internal situations which can easily be misinterpreted or misrepresented. Seems like it goes with the territory, and there is nothing further to discuss."
McPherson said he has "a new entrepreneurial venture in the spirits business" lined up as well as "involvement in a new media company."
ABC said it would announce a replacement for McPherson "shortly."
