There was no bourbon, but Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the incoming majority leader, still sounded upbeat about his White House meeting with President Barack Obama Wednesday.
"We had a good conversation about a variety of different issues where we might possibly find common ground," McConnell told CNN about the meeting, which was only the third private meeting he's had with the President since Obama has been in office.
McConnell, speaking when he returned to the Capitol, said he didn't want to say anymore about the specific issues they discussed or characterize the meeting any further.
The session lasted about an hour, relatively short considering the heavy load of thorny issues the two men must work on together over the next two years.
When he returned to the Capitol, a smiling McConnell was asked by CNN if he was given any bourbon, a drink the President recently joked he'd enjoy having with the senator who represents a state famous for its bourbon whiskey.
"No, this was not the bourbon summit," he chuckled. "But I'm still hoping we'll have it."
