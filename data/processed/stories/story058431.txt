Cameroon joined Ivory Coast and Nigeria as African qualifiers for the World Cup finals with a 4-1 victory over Tunisia in Yaounde Sunday.
Tied goalless from the first leg, the Indomitable Lions took a two goal cushion as Pierre Webo and Benjamin Moudandjo were on target.
But Tunisia were given hope through Ahmed Akaichi's strike after the break until a Jean Makoun brace made it six final appearances in the last seven for Cameroon.
On Saturday, the Super Eagles of Nigeria made the finals for the fifth time after easing to a 2-0 home win over Ethiopia for a 4-1 aggregate triumph, while the Ivory Coast held Senegal 1-1 in Casablanca to go through 4-2 on aggregate in a tense atmosphere.
That match was played in Casablanca, with Senegal punished by FIFA for crowd trouble, but they gave Ivory Coast an uncomfortable time.
Trailing 3-1 from the first leg, Senegal went ahead in the 77th minute after former Chelsea star Didier Drogba fouled Sadio Mane.
Substitute Moussa Sow scored from the spot and another goal would have put Senegal through on their away goal, a last gasp strike from Newcastle's Papiss Cisse's in the first leg, but they could not grab a second.
Kara Modji went close before Salomon Kalou made it safe for the Ivory Coast with a stoppage time equalizer to the relief of his teammates.
Nigeria, leading 2-1 from the first leg, were given a comfortable cushion when Victor Moses, on loan at Liverpool from fellow EPL side Chelsea, scored from the penalty spot after Anyalem Hailu handled.
Ethiopia put up a brave fight but the reigning African champions made sure of their passage when substitute Victor Obinna doubled Nigeria's lead after 82 minutes with a fine free kick.
"I am happy to be part of this history making. My target is now to help my country do well at the World Cup," he told AFP.
Ghana, 6-1 winners over Egypt in their opener, and Burkina Faso, holders of a 3-2 lead over Algeria, are in action in the other two qualifiers Tuesday.
