One simple tweet can help push the start button for action, thanks in part to the viral nature of social media.
Luke Crane, who says he works at Kickstarter and describes himself as a self-publisher of role-playing games, floated out a question on Monday evening: "Why are there so few lady game creators?"

After we at CNN saw this exchange taking place, we were inspired to share it with our reader community and keep the mentoring and leadership conversation going.
Are you a female interested in the video game industry, or do you know someone who is? What female techies and geeks do you admire, and what qualities can best help a woman, or anyone, succeed?
Do you have a mentor, or can you think of a good mentor for women interested in the video gaming world, or science and technology? And what suggestions do you have for those seeking a mentor, or for those who want to become mentors?
