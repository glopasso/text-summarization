After deliberating for 28 hours over four days, a federal jury Friday broke for the weekend without announcing a verdict in the trial of reputed Boston crime boss James "Whitey" Bulger.
The eight-man, four-woman panel will resume work at 9 a.m. Monday to continue processing testimony from more than 70 witnesses and over 800 exhibits compiled during the seven weeks of the trial.
Bulger, 83, is accused of racketeering, including involvement in 19 killings, and also 13 counts of extortion and money-laundering during a 20-year "reign of terror" that defined South Boston from the early '70s through 1995, when Bulger fled Boston.
After the jury was dismissed Friday, Bulger waived his rights to a forfeiture hearing on the nearly $822,000 and 30 weapons found in his Santa Monica, California, home where he had been living under an alias until he was arrested in 2011.
If he is found guilty, the money and weapons will be forfeited to the government.
U.S. District Court Judge Denise Casper asked Bulger if he understood he was giving up his right to have the jury decide whether or not his possessions will be forfeited if he is convicted.
"I understand yes," Bulger replied."
On Thursday, the jury asked to see one of the pieces of evidence in the case, a gun with an obliterated serial number. The last charge in the 32-count indictment accuses Bulger of possession of firearms with obliterated serial numbers.

Outside the courtroom Thursday, Bulger's lead attorney, J.W. Carney, said he was "very, very proud of the service these jurors have provided to us no matter what the outcome of the trial."
Carney added that it was difficult waiting for a verdict "because we invested at this point two years of work to get this case ready for trial."
"The longer the jury stays out the more it shows us they are as conscientious a jury as I have ever seen," Carney said. "I know that the prosecutors also believe that, the judge believes that. We are very pleased at that."
The widow of one of Bulger's alleged victims said separately that she believed "the jurors are looking at the situation and trying to do right by all of us."
Patricia Donahue, who has been at the trial almost every day with her three sons, added, "We been putting our lives on hold since this trial started, it's tough, but it's almost over now."
Still, Donahue said, "If deliberations go for a long period of time I'm going to start to worry about a mistrial."

During the seven-week trial, jurors heard dramatic testimony from convicted gangsters, bookies, extortion victims, a disgraced FBI supervisor, ex-drug dealers, retired FBI agents and relatives of people Bulger is accused of killing.
Prosecutors called 63 witnesses. The defense called 10. Former hit man John Martorano testified for both sides, for a total of 72 witnesses over 35 days.
Bulger never took the stand despite repeated hints from his lawyers throughout trial he would testify. In fact, Bulger seemed to want to testify. Questioned by Judge Casper, Bulger called his decision a "choice made involuntarily."
Bulger was a fugitive for more than 16 years, disappearing after a crooked FBI agent told him he was about to be indicted on federal racketeering charges. The FBI tracked him down and arrested him in 2011 in Santa Monica, California, where he had been living with his girlfriend under an alias.
