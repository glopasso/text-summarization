It's a boy!
Jessica Simpson gave birth to little Ace Knute Johnson via a scheduled C-section Sunday in Los Angeles, her rep told CNN.
It's the second child for the 32-year-old singer/TV personality and her fiance, former NFL player Eric Johnson. Ace has a big sister, 1-year-old Maxwell Drew.
The "Fashion Star" mentor accidentally revealed that she and Johnson were expecting a boy on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" in March.
"It's a total different pregnancy. I just feel awful ... I've been vomiting," Simpson told Kimmel. "The crazy thing is, I never knew a wiener could actually make me nauseous."
After realizing what she said, Simpson clarified, "Well, I guess I just told the world I'm having a boy."
