Michael Jackson's three children will use their father's shoes and sequined glove to make handprint and footprint impressions in the concrete in front of Hollywood's renowned Grauman's Chinese Theatre this month, Jackson's estate announced Thursday.
The January 26 ceremony is part of the promotion for the Los Angeles debut of Cirque du Soleil's "Michael Jackson THE IMMORTAL World Tour."
Prince, Paris and Blanket Jackson have been more public in recent months, a contrast to their lives before their father's 2009 death when they were shielded from public view.
The children attended the premiere of the traveling Cirque du Soleil show with their grandmother, Katherine Jackson, in October.
The "Immortal" show is touring the United States and Canada through this year before taking up residency in Las Vegas.
Show biz legends who left their handprints and footprints in Grauman's concrete courtyard on Hollywood Boulevard include Fred Astaire, Elizabeth Taylor, Judy Garland, Marilyn Monroe, Sidney Poitier, Clark Gable and Mary Pickford. The tradition started in 1928, just a year after the historic theater opened.
Michael Jackson's Hollywood Walk of Fame star is on the sidewalk in front of the theater.
