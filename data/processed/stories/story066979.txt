A train derailed in Florida at the Port of Tampa early Thursday, causing 15 rail cars to topple over and leading to an ethanol spill.
Firefighters used foam on the spill to reduce flammability, said Tampa fire department Capt. Lonnie Benniefield. The operation to upright the cars and clean up the spill are expected to last well into Thursday afternoon.
There was no immediate word on injuries.
