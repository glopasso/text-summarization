(RollingStone.com) -- Prince promised he'd bring his "Welcome 2 America" series of East Coast concerts on "a Purple Day in December," and now we know what that Purple Day will be:
According to New York R&B station WBLS, Prince will kick off a three-night stand at East Rutherford, New Jersey's IZOD Center on December 14th (with the other shows scheduled for the 15th and 17th), then cross the Hudson River for a December 19th concert at New York's Madison Square Garden.
Prince will also play MSG on December 29th (the night before Phish takes over the venue for their New Year's Eve stand). Expect more dates to be announced.

Live Nation, the "Welcome 2 America" promoters, have yet to offer tickets; WBLS writes that all five shows will go on sale October 30th.
Guests Maceo Parker, Cassandra Wilson, Janelle Monae, Sheila E., Mint Condition, Esperanza Spalding, Sinbad, the New Power Generation and more will join Prince at the shows, which the fan site Prince.org hypothesizes guesses will also include a string of after-concert concerts at Harlem's Apollo Theatre, the site of Prince's "Welcome 2 America" announcement.
