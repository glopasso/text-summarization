A Michigan mayor has apologized for anti-gay comments she apparently posted on Facebook over the summer.
"Yes I said it, yes I accept full responsibility," Troy, Michigan, Mayor Janice Daniels told CNN affiliate WDIV on Monday. "Yes I regret it, yes I am sorry."
A group of student demonstrators gathered outside Troy City Hall on Monday in protest of Daniels' comments and had called for her to step down.
According to a screen grab of Daniels' entry, dated June 25, the posting reads, "I think I am going to throw away my I Love New York carrying bag now that queers can get married there."
The posting came after New York became the sixth state in the union to legalize same-sex marriage.
Troy City Manager John Szerlag also chimed in Tuesday to address the scandal.
"The City of Troy is the second most diverse City in the State of Michigan and we are extremely proud of and enriched by our diversity," he said in a written statement. "Personal comments made by the mayor and any individual Council member are just that."
But others continued to express their outrage over the comments.
Denise E. Brogan-Kator, executive director for a Detroit-based gay rights advocacy group, said the mayor's language "shows obvious contempt for gay people."
Daniels, a Tea Party candidate, was elected to office last month.
Her Facebook page has since been removed.
