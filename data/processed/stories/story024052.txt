A California man was arrested Tuesday and accused of running a "revenge porn" website and demanding money through another site to remove the sexually explicit material.
Kevin Bollaert, 27, of San Diego, was charged with 31 felony counts of conspiracy, identity theft and extortion, the state attorney general's office said in a written statement.
Court documents allege that in December 2012 Bollaert created the website ugotposted.com, which allowed for the posting of sexually explicit photographs of people without their permission.
"This website published intimate photos of unsuspecting victims and turned their public humiliation and betrayal into a commodity with the potential to devastate lives," Attorney General Kamala D. Harris said.
The sexually explicit material, primarily of women, was routinely posted by angry former boyfriends and ex-husbands, authorities said.
As part of the public posting, the website required the full name of the person, location, age and Facebook profile link be provided, according to the documents.
Bollaert then allegedly created a second website, changemyreputation.com, that charged up to $350 to remove the content, the documents said.
Authorities allege he made tens of thousands of dollars through the website.
Bollaert was being held at the San Diego County jail in lieu of $50,000 bail. It was unclear Tuesday night whether he had legal representation.
