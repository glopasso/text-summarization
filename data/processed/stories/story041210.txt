IKEA has recalled eight of its children's wall-mounted lamps after one toddler died and another was injured, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday.
In each case, the lamp cord was pulled into the crib by the infant, creating the strangulation hazard. Both incidents took place in Europe.
There are eight different models involved in the recall: a blue star, a yellow moon, a pink flower, a white flower, a red heart, green bug, a blue seashell and an orange seahorse.
Customers who have one of the lamps should immediately check that the lamp and cord are out of reach of children and contact IKEA customer service to receive a repair kit free of charge, the retailer said.
Customers can call IKEA toll-free at (888) 966-4532, or online at www.ikea-usa.com. There's a recall link at the top of the page for more information.
