(EW.com) -- It's true â€” she can't stop.
If you've been foolishly walking around 2014 thinking that The Year of Miley was well behind us, you've been wrong: In an announcement made during Monday night's "Teen Wolf," the world learned that it would be getting a "Miley Cyrus: MTV Unplugged" special on Jan. 29.
"Unplugged," of course, is the 25-year-old MTV franchise that's given us memorable performances from the likes of Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Jay Z, Korn, and dozens more. As with many of those earlier iterations, the network teases in a press release that the Miley edition will "showcase a more intimate side of Cyrus and feature surprise guests for an unexpected re-invention of the songs that have defined her career, including several from her #1 critically acclaimed album, Bangerz."
Should be interesting! "Miley Cyrus: MTV Unplugged" will air Wednesday, Jan. 29., at 9 p.m. ET.
