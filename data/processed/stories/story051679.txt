The headquarters of Mexico's state oil was evacuated Tuesday night -- but it turned out to be a false alarm, the company said.
The Pemex Tower in Mexico City was cleared after an unspecified threat, Pemex said on its Twitter feed.
A short time later, the company tweeted, "It was a false alarm."
In February, a deadly explosion at Pemex headquarters killed at least 37 people. Officials said it was caused by a buildup of gas in the basement.
Pemex is Mexico's powerful and much-criticized state oil monopoly.
Thousands of people work at the company's headquarters, which includes a 54-story building. The annex where the February explosion happened is adjacent to the tower.
