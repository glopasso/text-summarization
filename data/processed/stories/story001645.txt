U.S. troops were among the casualties in the shooting rampage at the Colorado movie theater, including a sailor who was listed as unaccounted for, the Pentagon said Friday.
The Defense Department released a statement that said one sailor was injured and another one, known to have been at the theater, was unaccounted for. Two airmen were wounded in the incident, it said.
Buckley AFB in Aurora, Colorado, is the closest military base to the scene of the shootings. Spokesman Master Sgt. Jill Lavoie said some of the wounded were from Buckley.
About 10,000 troops -- including members of the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps -- are stationed at Buckley. Soon after the shooting, the base initiated a head count, Lavoie said.
One of the units on base is the 743rd Military Intelligence Battalion.
A post Friday on its Facebook page said that the Traumatic Stress Response Team (Mental Health Support) and Emergency Family Assistance Control Center (EFACC) had been activated at the base chapel. "If you or family members need assistance or counseling following the aftermath of the Aurora Movie Theater shooting, you can meet with the teams standing by to help you," the posting says.
The DoD statement also said that the suspect, James Holmes, is not a past or current member of any branch or component of the U.S. Armed Forces.
