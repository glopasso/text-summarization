Former Manchester United star Eric Cantona was arrested and cautioned Wednesday in London on suspicion of assault, Britain's Press Association reported.
London's Metropolitan Police confirmed that they arrested and subsequently cautioned "a man in his mid-40s on suspicion of common assault," but declined to release his name.
Police were called about the incident at about 1 p.m. The alleged victim, a man, did not require medical assistance, police said.
CNN could not immediately reach Cantona's representatives for comment.
Police in Britain can issue a caution to people for minor crimes. By accepting a caution, the suspect admits the offense and is released.
The caution is not a conviction, but it can be used as character evidence in trials for any other crime.
The French 47-year-old Cantona retired from football at age 30 but made his mark at Manchester United. The club's fans voted him as their player of the century in 2011.
