Ottawa (CNN)A third Canadian man arrested this week on terrorism-related charges will remain in custody after making a brief court appearance Tuesday.
Suliman Mohamed, 21, stood watching the court proceedings before being remanded into custody. He wore a brown-colored, hooded jacket and was carefully watched by his parents, sitting in the front row.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police announced Mohamed's arrest Monday, charging him with participating in the activity of a terrorist group and conspiracy to participate in terrorist activity.
Federal prosecutor Roderick Sonley indicated Tuesday that the government would disclose more details of evidence against Mohamed before his next court date, set for February 12.
Outside the Ottawa courthouse, Mohamed's father defended his son, saying he was a devout Muslim and not a radical.
"My son is not involved in this at all," Idris Altahir said. "He's a very normal person, quiet, polite and generous."
Police allege Mohamed's terrorist activity was directly linked to the arrests of Ashton and Carlos Larmond, two Ottawa twin brothers accused of conspiring to commit terrorism offenses.
"My son doesn't participate in these things, but we're going to see the evidence, what they have," Altahir said.
After an investigation dating back to at least August, the Larmond brothers, both 24, were arrested Friday in two different locations. Ashton Larmond was arrested in Ottawa, but his brother Carlos was arrested at Montreal's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, where police allege he was intending to travel overseas for terrorist purposes.
Carlos Larmond was charged with participation in the activity of a terrorist group but also with attempting to leave Canada to participate in terrorist activity abroad, a relatively new Canadian terrorism law.
Through their attorney, the brothers indicated they would be fighting the charges. To date, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have released few details.
