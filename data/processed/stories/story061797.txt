Jennifer Staple runs the Unite For Sight program which started in the U.S., but has branched out into working overseas.
Regarding sight as a fundamental human right that most people take for granted, the program aims to tackle a range of visual impairments that affect people across the world.
Jennifer will be traveling to Ghana and then India, taking volunteers to continue the work of Unite For Sight. Keep up with her experiences in her blogs and video diaries. E-mail to a friend
