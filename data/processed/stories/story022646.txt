The deaths of a father and his two daughters, whose bodies were discovered at Fort Hood, Texas, are being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, Army officials said Wednesday.
The bodies of the 43-year-old man and the two girls, ages 9 and 4, were found in on-post housing Tuesday morning, the Army said in a statement. The three were dependents of a female soldier who recently returned from an overseas deployment, it said.
"Although a final determination has not been made and the investigation is continuing, early indications are the deaths are possibly the result of a tragic murder-suicide involving the husband and the two children," the statement said.
Autopsies are being conducted by the Office of the Armed Forces Medical Examiner, the Army said.
The identities of the dead have not been released pending notification of next of kin.
