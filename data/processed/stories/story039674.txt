Pass the stuffing, and the popcorn. Over Thanksgiving weekend, movie theaters sold an estimated $295 million worth of tickets, breaking the record of $273 million set in 2009.
Knowing that there were going to be several hot movies in theaters and that people love to take pictures of their ticket stubs, we asked readers to tag their Instagram photos of ticket stubs #stubreview and share a brief review. Sure enough, the posts came.
We saw dozens of tagged images representing about a dozen movies and from several countries. Most attendees showed us first-run films, but some went to see older movies. Ticket prices ranged from about $2 for a matinee to $13 for a full 3-D experience.
The posts corresponded with the top five movies in the Thanksgiving weekend box office results, so we compiled a list of movies to feature based on those two sources. We also got reviews about a few others that weren't in that top tier, and we included a few of those right after the list. Did you see any of these?
