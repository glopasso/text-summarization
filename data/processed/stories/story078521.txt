Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak is out of the hospital but when he will return to the team is still in question.
Kubiak, 52, had a transient ischemic attack -- which the Mayo Clinic says has symptoms similar to a stroke -- during Sunday's game against the Indianapolis Colts.
The Texans said in a news release that Kubiak was released Tuesday and is expected to make a full recovery.
"I've been through an ordeal and my focus now is to get back to good health," Kubiak said, according to the team statement.
The coach was walking near the 20-yard line just after halftime started when he slowly bent over and then collapsed, shocking the crowd and members of Kubiak's own team and staff.
In a post-game news conference, defensive coordinator Wade Phillips recalled his confusion in the moments after Kubiak's collapse, describing it as "a shock to everybody."
"I was traveling in, and I saw him on the ground, and I kept asking, 'What happened?'" he said. "And that's kind of what happened with everybody."
The team said Kubiak "experienced dizziness and a light-headed feeling."
On the Mayo Clinic website a transient ischemic attack is differentiated from a stroke as it lasts only a few minutes and causes no permanent damage. It is often called a mini-stroke, the website said.
The Mayo Clinic did warn that 1 in 3 people who have a TIA eventually do have a stroke.
