Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced Sunday that national elections will take place September 7.
It'll mark yet another turn in Australian politics. In June, Rudd returned as prime minister of Australia -- three years after he was replaced in the office by his then-deputy Julia Gillard.
Rudd challenged Gillard for leadership of the Labor Party and won a 57-45 vote among fellow Labor members of parliament.
