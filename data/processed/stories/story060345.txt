(EW.com) -- Perhaps it's just the nature of the cycles of pop music, but doesn't it seem like Britney Spears has been gone for a while?
Her last album, "Femme Fatale," came out in 2011, but for some reason it seems like she's been missing in action for twice that time.
Regardless, Brit is back with a vengeance. Her new album's first single and video, "Work B***h," has already dropped, and yesterday she revealed that the new collection, which will be out December 3, is called "Britney Jean."
Before you go assuming that she's making some sort of awesome meta-allusion to Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean," just know that "Jean" is actually Spears' given middle name.

"It's a personal album, and all my family, they all call me Britney Jean, it's like a term of endearment, and I just wanted to share that with my fans," she told London's Capital FM yesterday.
Other details are relatively scarce, though we do know that Will.i.am is serving as executive producer and that "Work B***h" doesn't necessarily represent the album as a whole.

"That song is a reflection of Britney moreso than the album," Will told Billboard. "The album is what the album is, but we felt that song needed to come out to keep the foundation on what Britney represents. But it shouldn't reflect the albumâ€”an album is a body of work as a collective. If we had to pick a song like, 'Oh, what song fits every color of the record,' you shouldn't do that... We felt that song represents 'Piece of Me,' that Britney oomph."
