(EW.com ) -- FX has given a series order to "Baskets," a half-hour comedy starring "The Hangover's" Zach Galifianakis and hailing from recent Emmy winner Louis C.K.
The comedy tells the story of Chip Baskets (Galifianakis), a man who dares to follow his dream of becoming a professional clown, but must join the local rodeo after failing to get into a prestigious clown school in Paris.

"Zach Galifianakis, Louis C.K. and Jonathan Krisel have created an absolutely brilliant show," said Eric Schrier, one of the presidents of original programming at FX. "To say Zach's portrayal of the lead character Chip Baskets is hilarious/unique/riveting/fascinating would be an understatement. We can't wait for the world to meet him."
The 10-episode first season will begin production next year, with the series expected to premiere in 2016.
