Two lightning-triggered wildfires that have charred 24,000 acres in drought-stricken West Texas threaten 150 homes and 250 other buildings, officials said Wednesday.
"We're going to do everything we humanly, safely can do to protect those homes and residents," Incident Commander Tony Wilder said.
Jeff Davis County officials ordered voluntary evacuations, but residents have not left some neighborhoods, Texas Forest Service spokeswoman April Saginor said.
About 250 firefighters, including "hot shot teams" from Arizona, Nevada and Georgia, are on the scene to battle the two blazes in steep, rugged terrain, Saginor said.
The leading edge of the Livermore fire, which has burned 13,387 acres since last week, is within a mile of the Davis Mountain Resort community, fire officials said in a statement Wednesday. The fire is about 30% contained, it said.
"Winds associated with afternoon thunderstorm activity are making the firelines difficult to hold," the statement said.
The Spring Mountain fire, which is 60% contained, has burned 10,576 acres northwest of Fort Davis since starting April 24, it said.
"We've had about one-fourth of the moisture that we normally get," fire volunteer Kelly Bryan said.
