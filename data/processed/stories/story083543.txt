(CNN)Harrison Ford will reprise his role as Rick Deckard in the "Blade Runner" sequel. "Prisoners" director Denis Villeneuve is in talks to helm the Alcon Entertainment film.
The film is scheduled to start principle photography in the summer of 2016. Hampton Fancher, who co-wrote the original, and Michael Green have written the screenplay, which is based on an idea from Fancher and Ridley Scott.
The story takes place several decades after the conclusion of the 1982 original, which centered on a man (Ford) working as a blade runner who was tasked with chasing down machines called replicants.
Alcon Entertainment acquired the rights to "Blade Runner" in 2011 with the intention of making both prequels and sequels to the iconic science-fiction thriller. Bud Yorkin will serve as a producer on the sequel along with Alcon co-founders Andrew A. Kosove and Broderick Johnson.
Frank Giustra and Tim Gamble, CEOs of Thunderbird Films, will serve as executive producers.
Villeneuve most recently directed the crime thriller Sicario, staring Emily Blunt, Josh Brolin and Benicio Del Toro. He also directed Canada's Oscar-nominated French-language film "Incendies" and "Prisoners," staring Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal.
Ford next will be seen in Lionsgate's "The Age of Adaline" and will reprise his role as Han Solo in "Disney's Star Wars: The Force Awakens." He's repped by UTA.
