A New York nanny who allegedly stabbed to death two children in her care has been ruled emotionally fit to stand trial, prosecutors said on Friday.
Yoselyn Ortega, 50, was indicted on first- and second-degree murder charges in the deaths last October of Lucia Krim, 6, and her brother Leo, 2, court documents showed.
They were found by their mother fatally stabbed in the bathroom of their Upper West Side apartment.
Ortega has pleaded not guilty.
Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro said at a hearing on Friday that two psychiatrists had interviewed Ortega and determined she was capable of participating in her defense, according to a spokesman for the Manhattan District Attorney's office.
Ortega's attorney, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg, plans to contest the findings, the spokesman said.
Calls to Leer-Greenberg were not immediately returned to CNN.
Ortega appeared at the proceeding but did not speak. A Spanish interpreter was provided for her.
A native of the Dominican Republic, Ortega has been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 10 years.
Ortega is expected to appear in court again on May 6.
She faces up to life in prison if convicted.
