Kim Kardashian's 20-carat diamond engagement ring, a remnant of her 72-day marriage to NBA basketball player Kris Humphries, was auctioned Tuesday in New York by Christie's for $749,000, US Weekly reported.
Christie's auction house confirmed the sale of a 20-carat ring to an anonymous buyer. It did not reveal whether it was the ring that Humphries gave Kardashian.
The ring "far exceed the presale estimate" of $300,000 to $500,000, said Gabriel Ford, a spokesman for Christie's.
"This impressive diamond ring was sought out by two bidders in the back of the room, one online bidder and was ultimately won by a bidder on the phone," Ford said.
Humphries, an NBA forward, accused Kardashian of fraud by entering the marriage only to make millions of dollars with their wedding, Humphries' lawyer, Marshall Waller, told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge.
The August 20, 2011, wedding was aired in October on E! Entertainment in a two-part special titled "Kim's Fairytale Wedding: A Kardashian Event."
Kardashian filed for separation in October 2011, beginning a more than 20-month divorce battle.
The couple's divorce was finalized in June just days before she gave birth to a girl fathered by rapper Kanye West. The baby girl was named North.
