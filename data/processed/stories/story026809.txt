Anna Fenninger probably wishes every race was held on December 28th.
The Austrian alpine skier won for the third straight time on that day, taking a women's giant slalom at home in Lienz.
Fenninger overturned a 0.02-second first-run deficit Saturday to follow victories in a giant slalom in Lienz in 2011 and Semmering -- also in Austria -- in 2012.
Sweden's Jessica Lindell-Vikarby finished 0.50 seconds behind Fenninger, with reigning slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin of the U.S. a further 0.01 second adrift.
"I can't explain why I am successful on that specific day," Fenninger told the website of alpine skiing's governing body, the FIS. "It's just amazing to win again. I have good memories of my fist victory here and it helps a bit for sure.
"I really love Lienz and the slope."
Fenninger moved into second place in the overall standings behind Tina Weirather, who was a distant 17th Saturday.
"I was a bit disappointed with my last giant slalom results," said Fenninger, on the podium for the first time in five giant slalom races this season.
"We had a lot of speed events recently and I didn't get much time to train my giant slalom skills. I didn't know I could be able to win today but I was ready to give it all. It is just great it turned out to be such a big day for me.
"Winning in front of a home crowd makes it very special for sure."
Lindell-Vikarby extended her advantage in the giant slalom standings.
"I am glad to be on the podium and to keep the giant slalom red bib," she said. "In Val d'Isere (last week) I finished sixth and was a bit frustrated with myself because of the mistakes I made. Today was different. I am very happy."
Meanwhile, warm weather caused organizers to cancel a men's and women's slalom in Zagreb, Croatia next week.
