Jon Sandusky, son of former Penn State assistant coach Jerry Sandusky, was arrested in North Dakota on suspicion of drunken driving by the Fargo Police Department, a jail official said.
Authorities did not disclose additional information. But the North Dakota newspaper, The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead, said Sandusky was pulled over Tuesday morning for making an illegal turn.
After field sobriety tests, Sandusky was arrested, the newspaper reported.
Jon Sandusky is an executive with the Cleveland Browns football team.
His father, Jerry Sandusky, 69, was convicted in June 2012 on 45 counts of child sex abuse, ranging from corruption of minors to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. He was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison.
Jerry Sandusky's effort to appeal his case was denied last week.
Sandusky's adopted son, Matt, and six other victims of the former Penn State assistant football coach finalized settlement agreements with the university, attorneys said in August.
The amounts of the settlements are confidential.
