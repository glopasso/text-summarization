The two New York police officers shot to death earlier this month in Brooklyn are set to be immortalized in the streets of the city that they swore to protect.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and City Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito announced Wednesday that the city will move to name two streets in honor of the fallen officers, Detectives Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos.
A bill to rename a section each of two Brooklyn streets will be introduced and voted on by the New York City Council in January, according to a statement from the mayor.
"Our fallen heroes will never be forgotten. Their memory lives on in their families, and in the NYPD family. And now it will live on in the streets of the communities these brave men lived in and protected," de Blasio said.
The blocks where the officers lived will bear their names -- a stretch of Ridgewood Avenue for Ramos and of West 6th Street for Liu, the statement said.
The City Council members who represent the two detectives' districts, as well as the chair of the city's Parks and Recreation Committee, will sponsor the bill, the statement said.
Liu and Ramos were shot in their patrol car in Brooklyn on December 20. The body of their killer, 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley, was found shortly afterward. He had shot himself.
The NYPD posthumously promoted Liu and Ramos to the rank of detective.
