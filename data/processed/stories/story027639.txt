Investigators in the case of a missing Indiana University student hope forensic evidence will help them determine whether a decomposing body found in a creek Monday north of Indianapolis is connected with the disappearance of Lauren Spierer.
Bloomington police are in contact with the Indianapolis Metropolitan police, the agency that recovered the body, but there is not enough information for police to "determine the identity or a basic description of the body," Lt. William Parker said in a statement.
Parker hopes a pending forensic examination will provide more information, his statement said.
CNN affiliates reported an autopsy on the female body will be performed Tuesday.
Bloomington police have been searching for Spierer, 20, since June 2, when she was last seen leaving a sports bar in Bloomington after a night out with friends.
In mid-June, police had found possible new clues to Spierer's disappearance -- images of a white pick-up truck caught on a security surveillance video. But they ruled out a connection and were back to square one. Officials have received thousands of tips but none so far have yielded anything concrete.
