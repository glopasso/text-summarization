WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Former Illinois Gov. George Ryan and a co-defendant lost another legal round at the Supreme Court on Tuesday and will remain in prison on federal racketeering and fraud convictions.
Ex-Gov. George Ryan walks out of a Chicago, Illinois, courthouse after his April 2006 conviction.
Ryan and businessman Larry Warner claimed they did not receive a fair trial, but the justices, without comment, refused to intervene in the case.
Justice John Paul Stevens refused last fall to grant bail for the 74-year-old Ryan, a move that would have kept him out of jail to file more appeals.
The disgraced ex-governor reported to a federal prison in Wisconsin in November to serve a 6½-year sentence.
The men were convicted in April 2006 for fraud in a case stemming from bribes paid for various state licenses.
Their lawyers claimed the trial judge improperly removed two jurors while deliberations in the case had commenced, but a federal appeals court upheld the convictions.
Ryan, a Republican, served as governor from 1999 to 2003. He retired following investigations into political corruption in his administration.
He also was noted for issuing a moratorium on capital punishment in his state in 2000 over concerns innocent inmates might be executed.
The case decided Tuesday is Warner and Ryan v. U.S. (07-977).
