Sir Patrick Stewart, perhaps most widely known for his role as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," showed off his stage chops on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" this week in a skit about pesky plane passengers.
Among the portrayed offenses, which were compiled from Expedia's 2014 Airplane Etiquette Study, Stewart feasted on a day-old tuna sandwich and a slice of Camembert cheese as the "stinky snacker" before violating all concepts of personal space as the "seat climber."
The 74-year-old British thespian was promoting a new film, "Match," which opened on Thursday.
