Get ready for a bonus Jonas.
The oldest sibling of the pop trio, the Jonas Brothers, is going to be a dad.
In a few months, he'll be crooning lullabies at home and pop hits on the road.
Kevin and Danielle Jonas shared their happy news on Twitter, lighting up the social media network with a frenzy of responses from fans and celebrities alike.
"So pumped for my mom to be @daniellejonas you are going to be an amazing mom and can't wait!!!!" the daddy-to-be tweeted.
His wife chimed in.
"I am so happy to tell everyone, it's been so hard keeping this news in !!!" she wrote.
Jonas also confirmed the announcement on E!, which airs their reality show, "Married to Jonas."
"It's been the most exciting thing in my life so far," he told the network. "I'm excited and I'm nervous."
Fans on social media joined in on the excitement with the hashtag, #babyjonas.
"Found out about #BabyJonas and I couldn't be more excited if I was having my own baby! Lol," Briana Gibson tweeted.
Danielle Jonas, 25, is a former hairdresser. She met the singer while both were on vacation with their families in the Bahamas.
Two years later, in 2009, they tied the knot in a fairytale wedding in New York, complete with snow and a castle.
Their reality show chronicles their marriage life, the singer's hectic tours as part of a rock band and his wife's transition into the limelight.
During the show, Jonas, 25, has expressed his desire to start a family, but his wife has said she is waiting for the right time. The couple has two other babies of the four-legged kind -- Teacup Yorkies Riley and Macy.
It will be the first child for both.
