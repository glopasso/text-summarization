(CNN)  -- Roger Federer claimed his third title of the season with a 6-4 6-3 victory over Germany's Florian Mayer in the final of the Stockholm Open on Sunday.
It was the world number two's 64th career ATP title, joining Pete Sampras in fourth on the all-time career list.
American legend Jimmy Connors with 109 tournament wins heads the list, with Ivan Lendl (94) in second and John McEnroe (77) third.
The 16-time grand slam winner was always in command as he bounced back from his defeat to Andy Murray in last week's Shanghai Masters final.
His last visit to Sweden had been a decade ago when he was beaten in the second round, but this time around he made no mistake.
"Ten years ago I came here with no expectations and now I'm back as the favourite,' Federer told AFP.
"Anything but a win would be disappointing. I played a great event, it was a tough final. Florian played well a terrific final. I'm very happy to win."
Federer's other two titles in 2010 have come in the Australian Open and Cincinnati Masters prior to the U.S. Open.
Meanwhile, unseeded Serbian Viktor Troicki fought back from a set down to claim his maiden ATP title in the Kremlin Cup in Moscow, beating fourth seed Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus 3-6 6-4 6-3.
Troicki gained the decisive break of service in the decider to claim a 4-1 lead and he served out to win the match as he converted his first match point with a crisp volley.
Earlier, second seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus won the WTA tournament being held at the same arena, beating home home hope Maria Kirilenko 6-3 6-4 in the final.
Unseeded Roberta Vinci of Italy won the WTA tournament in Luxembourg with a 6-3 6-4 victory over eighth seed Julia Gorges of Germany in the final.
