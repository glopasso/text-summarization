A bus accident along the New Jersey Turnpike near East Brunswick killed two people and injured 42 others Monday night, state police said.
The 50-year-old bus driver was killed when he was ejected through the front window, according to Sgt. Stephen Jones. A second person died at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in Brunswick. Five others are in the hospital's trauma unit.
The "driver for some reason lost control ... struck a guide rail and a concrete abutment," Jones said.
The bus "appears to have entered grass on center median & hit overpass support, then hit embankment on right of road," according to the official Twitter account of the state police.
The accident involving a Super Luxury Tours bus took place near Exit 9 on the turnpike, according to Jones. The bus was traveling from New York's Chinatown to Philadelphia.
Super Luxury Tours, Inc. is located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, according to police.
