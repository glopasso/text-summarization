As the first week of the John Edwards federal criminal trial comes to an end, where the former Democratic senator and presidential candidate is accused of using hundreds of thousands of dollars of donations to conceal his affair with a campaign videographer without reporting the money to federal authorities, we wanted to take a look back at some statistics about other politicians in trouble.
Based on these numbers, Edwards certainly isn't the first pol to get himself into some hot water -- personally, politically or legally.

15 - Days between the U.S. Supreme Court ruling against Nixon, that executive privilege of the president is not above the law, and Nixon's resignation.
17 - Guilty verdicts in the retrial of Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges. He was sentenced in 2011 to 14 years.
4 - Governors of Illinois who have been sentenced to prison since 1973.
