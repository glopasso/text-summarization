Prince Philip received a birthday visit on Monday from his wife, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, as he recovered from abdominal surgery at a London hospital.
A Buckingham Palace spokesman said Philip, who turned 92, was "comfortable and in good spirits." The visit lasted about an hour.
The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the hospital on Thursday and is expected to stay there for up to two weeks, according to the palace statement. After that, he likely will convalesce for two months.
The surgery took place Friday, the palace said. It went as planned and Philip is "progressing satisfactorily."
Prince Philip: The man behind the queen
Philip left Greece a year after he was born there, following the 1922 overthrow of his uncle King Constantine I.
Despite his roots, he has a mixed ancestry and, like his wife, is a great-great-grandchild of Britain's Queen Victoria.
A Royal Navy veteran, he met Elizabeth in 1939 and married her in November 1947. They have four children.
In addition to his royal and military duties, Philip has served as president of the World Wildlife Fund and the International Equestrian Foundation.
Philip has had a number of documented health problems in recent years, including treatment for a blocked coronary artery in December 2011 and a hospitalization in June 2012 for a bladder infection.
He was admitted again to a hospital -- this time in Scotland -- for treatment of the latter ailment two months later.
