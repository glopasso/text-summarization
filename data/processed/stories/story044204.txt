Colorado Sen. Mark Udall's brother died on a hiking trip in the Rocky Mountains, officials said.
Randy Udall, 61, went on a hike in the Wind River Range in Wyoming on June 20 and was expected back six days later.
When the experienced hiker did not return, family members reported him missing. Rescue crews and helicopters scoured mountain passes to find him.
A helicopter search team discovered his body in a remote area on Wednesday afternoon, the Sublette County Sheriff's Office said.
It appeared that he died of natural causes, the senator said in a statement, thanking rescuers for their search efforts.
"Randy left this earth doing what he loved most: hiking in his most favorite mountain range in the world. He appeared to be on the obscure, off-trail route that he had proposed to his family," the statement said. "The entire Udall family is touched beyond words by the tremendous outpouring of support from people around the country. Randy's passing is a reminder to all of us to live every day to its fullest, just as he did."
