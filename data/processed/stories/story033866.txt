(RollingStone.com ) -- It's nothing to "whoop whoop" about: The ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit against horrorcore hip-hop act Insane Clown Posse just got a lot more disgusting, and it involves a glass sex toy reportedly owned by Kid Rock. Attorneys for the group's former publicist, Andrea Pellegrini, have subpoenaed the rocker to produce the item as court evidence, Detroit Free Press reports.

The subpoena states that "Dirty Dan" Diamond, a former employee of ICP's label Psychopathic Records, gave the item to Kid Rock after a failed attempt at passing it along to Pellegrini. According to a press release from the publicist's attorneys, Diamond admitted under oath to this disturbing gesture on Friday during his deposition in Las Vegas; he reportedly tried to give Pellegrini the glass phallus after learning she was single. Kid Rock (real name Robert James Ritchie) has 14 days to produce the item in court; both the singer and his manager, Lee Trink, were unavailable for comment for the Free Press as of Tuesday evening.

Pellegrini, a three-year employee with Psychopathic Records, filed the suit in September 2013, alleging "wrongful termination, harassment, retaliation and infliction of emotional distress" against ICP (Joseph "Violent J" Bruce and Joseph "Shaggy 2 Dope" Utsler), Psychopathic Records and the group's manager, William Dale. (She also described her time at the 2012 Gathering of the Juggalos festival as "a living hell.") According to the Free Press, an attorney for ICP denied the allegations last year.
