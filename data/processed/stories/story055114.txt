The National Park Service said Saturday that the National Christmas Tree located just south of the White House has died due to complications from "transplant shock."
The Park Service removed the Colorado blue spruce from the White House grounds early Saturday. The tree had replaced another which was damaged in a wind storm early last year.
The Park Service said it always has a replacement tree lined up to make sure one is in place for the annual National Christmas Tree Lighting event held each December. The new tree is also a Colorado spruce but won't be planted until late October.
