(Mashable) -- We've all done it. Your friend uploads a picture of their new puppy to Facebook, and you somehow manage to leave a comment congratulating them instead on their "new pappy."
So what do you do? Until now, the only thing Facebook would let you do to correct the error was delete the comment and start again.
But starting Thursday the site is also now offering the ability to edit your comment â€” and change that pappy back to the puppy you intended in the first place. The edit option appears in the form of a small pencil icon on the right side of your comment. Clicking on the pencil will bring up a drop-down menu with the option to edit your comment as well as the option to delete it entirely.
Facebook told Mashable the site will also be "showing the editing history for a comment so that subsequent commenters or likers have the full context of the conversation." That way if someone responds to a comment that gets edited commenters in the future can see the history of the conversation and not get lost.
The editing ability went live on Thursday evening, and will be gradually rolling out to all users over the next few days.
Has the comment editing system kicked in for you yet? Let us know in the comments.
