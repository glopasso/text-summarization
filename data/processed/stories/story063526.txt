When do boxes of baby wipes, laundry tablets and kitty litter get you in trouble?
When they're stuffed with marijuana, ammunition and .40 caliber handguns.
A woman was arrested at John F. Kennedy International in New York on Monday for trying to smuggle two disassembled .40 caliber handguns, 350 rounds of ammunition, four magazines for the guns and 33 pounds of marijuana, according to the federal Transportation Security Administration.
TSA officers discovered the contraband after opening two pieces of checked luggage for inspection.
"The officers saw the suitcases were jam-packed with cans and boxes for baby wipes, coffee, floor dusting sheets, lemonade mix, iced tea mix, a box of cat litter and a box of laundry tablets," the TSA statement read.

Upon further investigation, the TSA said they discovered the luggage belonged, not in fact to a thirsty homemaker, but a traveler trying to smuggle weapons and drugs.
The traveler, who was not identified in the statement, was carrying a Canadian passport and headed to Barbados.
She was arrested on state charges, said TSA.
