(Mashable) -- A 56-page document from Microsoft, dating back to mid-2010, reveals company plans for an "Xbox 720" gaming console. The recently leaked document has been removed since its discovery.
Notable features include Xbox SmartGlass, Blu-ray support, 3-D glasses, cloud-based gaming and an improved Kinect system. If the Xbox 720 described in the document is true, Microsoft's next-generation entertainment console could change the future of gaming.
The console will be loaded with a 1080p output with full 3D support, according to The Verge. The image above shows what the follow-up to the Xbox 360 might look like.
The sleek black Xbox 720 portrayed in the documents will seemingly be the only entertainment device you'll need. Microsoft's goal is to sell 100 million units at around $299 each in 2013. New Kinect 2 hardware will incorporate better voice recognition, hardware processing and stereo imaging.
The documents also showcase plans for the "Fortaleza" Kinect glasses â€” which will be sold separately. The glasses will be able to connect to Wi-Fi and incorporate augmented reality into gaming. It's marked for a 2014 debut.
