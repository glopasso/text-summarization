The MTV Video Music Awards nominations are out, and 2014's show is set to be all about Beyonce.
The 32-year-old singer leads this year's group of nominees with a total of eight, including nods for video of the year, best female video, best choreography and best video with a social message.
Two of Bey's nominations are shared with her husband, Jay Z, who appears on the single "Drunk in Love." The sultry black-and-white music video that accompanied the track is nominated for video of the year and best collaboration.
Right behind Beyonce are a pair of MCs: Australian newcomer Iggy Azalea and returned rap giant Eminem received seven nominations each.
The twerking star of last year's MTV VMAs, Miley Cyrus, is up for two awards: video of the year and best direction for her "Wrecking Ball" clip.
