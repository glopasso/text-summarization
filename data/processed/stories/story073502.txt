The former New York nightclub hostess who gained fame when she was named as one of golfer Tiger Woods' alleged mistresses could soon be helping clients track cheating spouses.
Rachel Uchitel graduates from the DGA Detectives Academy in Los Angeles next month, according to school director Dale Gustafson.
"She's smart," Gustafson said Wednesday. "One of her strengths is field interviews and getting information from people."
A job with Gustafson's agency is waiting for Uchitel, he said. "She's expressed an interest in doing that, but it's still up in the air."
Uchitel, halfway through the 10-week course, has already studied asset recovery, criminal defense, family law, skip tracing and missing persons investigations, he said.
"I have a feeling she's going to be specializing in missing persons," he said. "She really does have a strength there."
Next week's classes will focus on personal injury investigations, he said.
In the days after Woods was injured in a November 2009 car crash in his Florida neighborhood, rumors surfaced about an alleged affair between the golfer and Uchitel. She initially denied the relationship and has refused to publicly talk about it.
Before starting the detective training, Uchitel was a cast member of the current season of TV's "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew."
Dr. Drew Pinsky told HLN's Joy Behar last month that he diagnosed Uchitel as a "love addict," an affliction in which a person "mistakes intensity for intimacy."
