Petra Kvitova will face Victoria Azarenka in the final of the WTA Championships in Istanbul on Sunday.
The reigning Wimbledon champion recovered from a set down against Australia's Samantha Stosur to eventually win 5-7 6-3 6-3.
Belarussian, Azarenka enjoyed a more comfortable 6-2 6-3 win over Russia's Vera Zvonareva.
Kvitova started brightly enough against Stosur taking a 4-2 lead in the opening set, but then a series of unforced errors let the increasingly confident Australian back into the contest.
It wasn't long though before the left-handed Czech soon found her rhythm grinding down the spirited Stosur with a series of forehand winners to take the second set and level the match.
Kvitova then raced into a 4-0 lead in the deciding set before Stosur pulled one break back but it was too late to save the match.
The 22-year-old Azarenka, meanwhile, enjoyed much the better of a series of baseline rallies with her Russian opponent, and despite her serve not being in the best order ran out an easy winner.
The victor on Sunday will rise to number two in the world rankings.
Kvitova will start as favourite as she has won the two previous meetings between the pair this year.
