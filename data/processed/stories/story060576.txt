Several boaters are missing after separate incidents on Lake Michigan over the weekend, the Coast Guard said.
Near Chicago, searchers were looking for four people Sunday about seven miles offshore, where rescuers had pulled two boaters from the water.
One rescued person "was in a hypothermic state but reported four or five additional people in the water, reportedly all wearing life jackets," the Coast Guard said.
The boaters entered the water late Saturday night during a voyage from New Buffalo, Michigan, to Chicago. Officials didn't say what happened to their boat.
In a separate incident, rescuers pulled five people from the lake near the Michigan City Lighthouse in Indiana Saturday. They called off the search for a sixth person who was missing Sunday morning.
"The six people reportedly jumped off their boat into the water to escape the heat, but then their boat started drifting away and they could not get back to it," the Coast Guard said. "None of the people in the water were reportedly wearing life jackets."
Temperatures in Lake Michigan are much lower than normal for this time of year, the Coast Guard said, after a long and cold winter.
In southern Lake Michigan, the water temperature is 45 degrees, officials said.
