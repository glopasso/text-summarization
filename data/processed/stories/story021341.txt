A man charged in the alleged hit-and-run death of a 4-year-old girl at a Florida day care center will remain in jail at least until a Monday hearing about bail, a judge in Orlando ruled Friday.
The judge initially set bail for Robert Alex Corchado at $100,000, but prosecutors asked that it be revoked. At a hearing Friday, the judge gave the state until Monday to file a request that Corchado be detained until his trial.
Authorities allege Corchado, 28, was behind the wheel of an SUV that hit a car, sending the car into a Winter Park day care center and killing Lily Quintus, 4, on Wednesday afternoon.
Corchado, who Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Maj. Cindy Williams said had gang ties as well as numerous drug arrests, fled the scene then surrendered at the Orange County jail, according to a tweet from the Sheriff's Office.
He was charged with leaving the scene of an accident with a death.
Thirteen children were injured, as was one adult.
Williams said Corchado rented a black Mazda CX-5 on Wednesday afternoon after fleeing the accident. Corchado's Dodge Durango was found abandoned a few hours after the crash.
Lily's mother, Nicole Quintus, called her daughter "painfully beautiful" and told the New York Daily News, "She was incredible and she deserved so much more."
"I have no idea how I'm supposed to survive after this. I don't know how I'm supposed to go back to a daily routine. I'm wandering about, lost," she told the paper.
Lily's 7-year-old brother aspires to be an engineer and is building a time machine out of his Erector set so he can bring his sister back, the Daily News reported.
Lily's father is a paramedic with the Groveland Fire Department, and one of his co-workers has set up a page so people can donate funds for medical and funeral expenses. As of Thursday night, people had given more than $33,000.
