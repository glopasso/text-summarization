(CNN)Bill Cosby's lawyer has denied the latest sexual assault allegation against the comedian.
Cosby was not in California on the day in 2008 when Chloe Goins alleges the comedian sexually assaulted her at a Playboy Mansion party, Martin Singer, Cosby's lawyer, said Friday in a statement.
"On Wednesday, Chloe Goins and her attorney publicly accused Bill Cosby of assaulting Ms. Goins in 2008 at the 'Midsummer Night's Party' held at the Playboy Mansion in California," the statement said.
"The party took place on August 9, 2008. Mr. Cosby was in New York on that date. We will be providing documentary evidence to the appropriate authorities which conclusively establishes Mr. Cosby's whereabouts on August 9 and for the preceding and succeeding days."
Goins, now 24, told her story to investigating officers of the Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday. Like other women who have accused Cosby, Goins said she was drugged and woke up undressed, said her lawyer, Spencer Kuvin.
More than 20 women have come forward with claims of sexual assault against the comedian. Many of the accusations date back decades.
Kuvin issued his own statement in response to Singer's statement, saying:
"The press should be asking Mr. Singer if Mr. Cosby was at the mansion at 'any' time during the summer of 2008.  If he has proof of his whereabouts during that entire summer then we would like to see it.  If he is willing to prove it, then I can comment.  Otherwise it is just a lawyer talking, which is not evidence."
