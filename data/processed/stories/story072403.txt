A parachutist fell to his death Saturday when his parachute failed to deploy during an air show north of Tampa, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said.
The man, Mark Curto, 62, had jumped from a biplane and died on the scene, sheriff's spokeswoman Melanie Snow said. The pilot landed safely.
Curto was from Tampa.
The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board have been notified, she said.
