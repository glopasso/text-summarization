A new night proved not to be a major hindrance to the Emmys.
According to the Los Angles Times, Monday night's NBC telecast of the 66th Primetime Emmy Awards saw a slight dip in viewership, with 15.6 million tuning in. Last year's CBS show, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris, was Emmy's most watched ceremony since 2005, with 17.8 million total viewers.
Yet even with the decline the show still won its time slot.
TV By The Numbers reports that the Emmys garnered a 4.2 rating in the coveted 18-49 demographic. That made it NBC's most successful Monday night programming in the past two years, excluding the Olympics.

It was the first time the Emmys hasn't aired on a Sunday night since 1976. Last year's show saw robust ratings despite the challenge of going up against series finales of popular cable shows "Dexter" and "Breaking Bad." It also got help from having Sunday night football as a lead-in.
This year's show was hosted by late-night talk show host and former "SNL" funnyman Seth Meyers. On Tuesday, NBC posted footage of Meyers ending the Emmys by participating in the ALS ice bucket challenge.
