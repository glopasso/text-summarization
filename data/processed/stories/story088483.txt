Actor Charlie Sheen cited "irreconcilable differences" when he filed for divorce from Brooke Mueller Monday afternoon, a marriage that apparently hit the rocks when he was arrested last Christmas Day.
Sheen listed December 25, 2009, as their date of separation and the day their twin infant sons began living solely with him. The couple married on May 30, 2008.
The divorce petition, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, requested jointed legal and physical custody of Bob and Max Sheen, the boys who were born to the couple on March 14, 2009.
Sheen was arrested on felony domestic violence charges after Mueller called police to their holiday home in Aspen, Colorado, last Christmas. She claimed he held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her, the police report said.
The felonies were reduced to a misdemeanor third-degree assault count in exchange for his guilty plea in August. The plea deal allowed his time in a a Malibu rehab center to count for his 30-day jail term.
Sheen's three-month probation is set to end Tuesday.
He signed the divorce petition Monday morning, just six days after New York police reported finding him "emotionally disturbed" in a hotel room. Sheen was briefly hospitalized for what his representative said was an allergic reaction to medication.
The New York incident led to tabloid speculation that Sheen's mental and physical health was in danger, but his publicist Stan Rosenfield sought to shoot down the reports.
Rosenfield shared with CNN an e-mail he received Sunday from Sheen manager Mark Burg, describing the reports as "complete bulls--t fabricated lies!!!"
"Charlie is fine and will be at work on Tuesday," Burg wrote.
The son of actor Martin Sheen, Charlie Sheen signed a contract last summer to continue with his hit CBS sitcom "Two and a Half Men."
