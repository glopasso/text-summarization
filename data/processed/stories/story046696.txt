Alex Ferguson achieved it on his Old Trafford debut but David Moyes has had to wait a little longer.
After a mixed start to the Premier League season (win/draw/loss) and a vaguely farcical conclusion to the transfer window, United's new boss can now quietly rejoice after his first home win.
A win was always on the cards. Their opponents -- Premier League new boys Crystal Palace -- last won a league fixture at the "Theatre of Dreams" way back in 1989. And United hadn't lost to a newly-promoted side on home soil for 12 years.
The first of United's two goals came courtesy of a controversial penalty awarded on the stroke of half time when Kagisho Dikgacoi was adjudged to have brought down Ashley Young.
The South African midfielder was giving his marching orders by the referee before Robin van Persie calmly converted the spot kick.

Ten-men Palace did well to deny United more goals for most of the second half, but a decisive second eventually came courtesy of a Wayne Rooney free-kick nine minutes from the end.
The English striker, who returned to action after gashing his forehead in training late last month, fired home from 25 yards to ensure all three points for Moyes' team.

"Like any manager, to win a game, there's always an element of relief. I'm pleased to get the first win out of the way," Moyes said.
"I think if we had lost I don't think I'd have been talking to much about it, but we won today ..."
The victory comes ahead of a vital week for the new manager. Moyes takes charge of United in the Champions League for the first time on Tuesday against Bayer Leverkusen before traveling across town to play Manchester City the following Sunday.
Manuel Pellegrini's City side, who have also made a stuttering start to the season, dropped points against Stoke City on Saturday playing out a goalless draw at the Britannia Stadium.
