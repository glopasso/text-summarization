George Michael spent two days in a London hospital last week, but his representative is not revealing why.
The singer was admitted for treatment on Thursday, May 22, and was "well and resting" after he was discharged over the weekend, according to Michael rep Connie Filippello.
Nothing more will be made public "given the personal nature of this matter," she said.
Filippello used the media spotlight drawn by the illness to make sure fans know the singer has new music coming out this summer.
"He is very much looking forward to the release of his new single in July," she said.
Michael turns 51 in June.
