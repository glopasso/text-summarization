Justin Bieber's neighbors want the teen to slow down when he's driving through their exclusive Calabasas, California, community.
"Somebody's going to beat him up if he doesn't slow down," the bodyguard for one of the many celebrities who live near the singer told CNN on Wednesday.
Retired NFL star Keyshawn Johnson went to Bieber's home Monday to counsel him about the dangers of going too fast on the residential streets, but Bieber wouldn't speak to him, Johnson's rep said.

Although his rep said Johnson did not report Bieber's speeding to law enforcement, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman told CNN that two neighbors did call the local sheriff's station to complain.
Deputies visited Bieber's home in the Oaks, but Bieber refused to talk to them, too, sheriff's department spokesman Steve Whitmore said.
Bieber's representatives have not responded to CNN's calls for comment.
