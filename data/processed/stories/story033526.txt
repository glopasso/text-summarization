Cheick Diabate scored twice as Mali defeated 10-man Ghana 2-0 to finish third in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations on Saturday.
The Bordeaux striker opened the scoring in the 23rd minute stabbing home a rebound after Ghana keeper Adam Larsen failed to hold onto Bakaye Traore's low shot.
Ghana offered little in reply during the remainder of the first period with only a Jordan Ayew shot forcing a save from Oumar Sissoko.
The Black Stars did manage to get the ball in the back of the net when Sulley Muntari fired home but he was ruled offside.
