One Goh, the 43-year-old California man charged with fatally shooting seven people this month at the Oikos University in Oakland, has not eaten while being held in jail without bail, the Alameda County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.
"He came to our custody three weeks ago, and he is drinking water -- liquids -- and he's not eating food. We say 'he is not eating' because a strike would be in protest of something, and he is not," said Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the sheriff's office.
"He says he is not eating because he feels shame, but what that means nobody really knows," Nelson added.
Goh is receiving psychological care, Nelson said.
Goh, who is Korean-American, is charged with seven counts of murder with special circumstances and three counts of attempted murder in a mass shooting earlier this month at Oikos, a small college that caters primarily to the Korean-American Christian community.
His next court appearance is April 30.
District Attorney Nancy E. O'Malley has said Goh voluntarily left Oikos in November because he was upset. Goh "wanted some money back for tuition he had paid, and it is also clear that he focused on one particular administrator at the school who was not present at the school" on the day of the shooting, O'Malley told reporters.
The seven fatally shot victims, all from California, were: Katleen Ping, 24; Judith Ona Seymour, 53, of San Jose; Lydia H. Sim, 21, of Hayward; Sonam Choedon, 33, of El Cerrito; Grace Eunhea Kim, 23, of Union City; Doris Ifeyinwa Chibuko, 40, of San Leandro; and Tshering Rinzing Bhutia, 38, of San Francisco, according to prosecutors.
Goh is also charged with the attempted murder of Dawinder Kaur, 19; Ahmad Javid Sayeed, 36; and Grace Kirika, 43, O'Malley said.
Goh allegedly used a .45-caliber gun with four fully loaded ammunition magazines, and most of the rounds were fired, authorities said.
