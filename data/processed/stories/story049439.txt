(HLNtv.com) -- It took less than an hour for Joshua Young's defense team to call four additional witnesses, including his aunt and social worker, before resting its case Thursday.
Young, who did not testify in his own defense, is charged with complicity to murder for his alleged role in the slaying of his stepbrother, Trey Zwicker, in May 2011.
Prosecutors say the 17-year-old acted in concert with his father, Josh Gouker, to kill Zwicker, 14.
Gouker, who was Zwicker's stepfather, pleaded guilty to a charge of murder, and was sentenced July 26 to life in prison. Young's defense attorneys argue that Gouker acted alone in killing Zwicker.
Young's aunt, Cynthia Guenther, took the stand Thursday in Jefferson County Circuit Court in Louisville, Kentucky, to describe her nephew's demeanor at Zwicker's funeral, calling him "very sad, very distraught, teary-eyed."
The social worker who visited Young's home once every month between 2007 and 2012 also testified Thursday that she witnessed Young and Zwicker together on two occasions.
"They were sitting together on the couch, playing video games. Very relaxed, kind of joking with each other," said Allison Miller about a 2011 visit she made to the home.
Miller told prosecutors during her short cross-examination that she witnessed the pair interacting for only about a minute before Gouker told them to leave the room.
The judge told jurors he expected them to get the case around lunchtime Friday, after attorneys present their closing arguments. The judge also told jurors to pack an overnight bag in case they don't reach a verdict Friday night, in which case they would be sequestered and continue to deliberate on Saturday.
