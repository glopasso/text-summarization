It doesn't matter if you're taking on double black diamond trails, gliding cross country through the woods, or staring at the bunny slope with a sense of doom, you can embrace apres ski life.
Much like the 19th hole in golf, apres ski is a chance to reward oneself after a busy day of relaxation.
It might involve meeting friends for a beer, it might mean a couples massage at a Swiss-style spa, or it could just be going out for dinner to see what bison tastes like, but it's definitely a time meant to be enjoyed.
With winter approaching quickly (and already here in some areas), Kayak.com put together the most popular 4- and 5-star ski destination hotels and resorts in the United States.
Whether it's a spa treatment or a drink by the fire, here's Kayak's list of the perfect places to sit back, kick up your feet or plaster cast, and unwind.
