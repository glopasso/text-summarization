A third victim of last week's shooting at a Washington state high school has died, according to the hospital that treated victims.
Fourteen-year-old Shaylee Chuckulnaskit died Friday night at Providence Regional Medical Center, not far from Marysville Pilchuck High School, where she and four other students were gunned down last Friday as they sat in the school cafeteria.
"The entire Providence family is deeply saddened by this news and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to Shaylee's family," the medical center said, added that the teenager known as Shay "passed away ... as a result of severe injuries from last Friday's school shooting."
The Chuckulnaskit family released its own statement, saying: "Our hearts are broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter. Shay means everything to us.
"In Shay's short life she has been a radiant light bringing us incredible joy and happiness. She has been a loving daughter, a caring sister, a devoted friend and a wonderful part of our community. We can't imagine life without her."
In the hours and days following the shooting, two other Marysville families were thrown into sudden mourning with the deaths of students Zoe Galasso and Gia Soriano.
Shaylee was one of three students hospitalized after a gunman opened fire in the cafeteria.
The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, took his own life, in the school cafeteria.
