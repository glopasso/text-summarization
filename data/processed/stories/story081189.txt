One-time Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole has his candidate for 2016: Mitt Romney.
Dole, a 91-year-old former Senate majority leader and 1996 GOP presidential nominee, said as he introduced Romney, the party's 2012 nominee, during a campaign rally Monday: "I want him to run again."
Dole and Romney were in Overland Park campaigning for Kansas Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who faces a stiff challenge from independent businessman Greg Orman.
Romney brushed off the remark. "You never know what a 90-year-old is going to say, do you?" he said. "I'll tell ya."
