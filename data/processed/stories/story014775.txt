The cause of death for Sage Stallone, the 36-year-old son of actor Sylvester Stallone, won't be officially known for another two months, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Coroner said Sunday.
The autopsy on Stallone, who was found dead in his Los Angeles home Friday, was completed Sunday, the coroner's spokesman said. It normally takes six weeks for toxicology tests to be completed by the coroner's lab.
Sage Stallone's attorney, George Braunstein, told Los Angeles TV station KNBC that Sage Stallone was engaged to be married and was working on various film projects at the time of his death.
"Sylvester Stallone is devastated and grief-stricken over the sudden loss of his son Sage Stallone," his representative said in a statement. "His compassion and thoughts are with Sage's mother, Sasha. Sage was a very talented and wonderful young man. His loss will be felt forever."
He acted in several movies, including "Daylight" and "Rocky V" with his father.
The younger Stallone also co-founded Grindhouse Releasing, a company that describes itself as "dedicated to the restoration and preservation of motion pictures historically held in very low regard."
