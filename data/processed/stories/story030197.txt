A Marine based in North Carolina died during a gun battle with police in Texas after authorities said he killed one person and wounded five others in a shooting spree.
The Texas Department of Public Safety said the suspect, Esteban J. Smith, 23, was stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. He was killed early Sunday when he exchanged gunfire with a state trooper and a game warden, police said.
Smith's death ended a shooting spree that had covered more than 80 miles and lasted more than two hours.
Authorities say Smith killed Alicia Torres, 41, in the town of Eola in Concho County. She was found dead in her car about 6 a.m.
He also shot one person in Eden at 4:30 a.m., two people in Brady, then went back to Eden where he wounded one other victim.
Smith shot a sheriff's deputy who came upon the suspect on the highway just north of Eden, police said.
State troopers and the game warden arrived on scene a short time later.
Two victims, including the deputy, Richard Doane, remain hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Three other people were treated at a hospital and released.
Authorities found an assault rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition in Smith's pickup.
