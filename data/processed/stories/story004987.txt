George Zimmerman, who sold his first painting on eBay for a whopping $100,000, is at it again.
And this time his subject is the woman who charged him with second-degree murder: Special Prosecutor Angela Corey.
The painting, a swirl of bright red and yellow, shows Corey with her fingers pinched.
The caption, in all caps, says, "I have this much respect for the American judicial system - Angie C."
It's an artistic depiction of a much-reprinted photograph of Corey from the news conference when she announced the charge against Zimmerman.
CNN left phone and email messages with the prosecutor's office for a response.
Zimmerman's brother, Robert, posted a photo of the painting on Twitter on Wednesday night.
"Very proud to introduce @TherealGeorgeZ 's latest..."Angie". Sale info & details available tomorrow."
Last month, the former neighborhood watchman listed an original painting on eBay: An 18-by-24-inch canvas featuring a blue, waving American flag with the words, "God, one nation, with liberty and justice for all" emblazoned across it.
The winning bid on it was $100,099.99.
"Everyone has been asking what I have been doing with myself. I found a creative, way to express myself, my emotions and the symbols that represent my experiences," the item description for that painting read. "My art work allows me to reflect, providing a therapeutic outlet and allows me to remain indoors."
Zimmerman has been in and out of the spotlight since his July acquittal in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012.
In December, Florida prosecutors said they would not charge Zimmerman after a domestic dispute with his girlfriend in November resulted in his arrest. Previously, he was stopped several times for speeding.
Zimmerman told a judge in November he had $150 to his name and was $2.5 million in debt.
Zimmerman won't be charged in domestic dispute, prosecutor says
