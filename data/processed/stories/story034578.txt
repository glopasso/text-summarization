Disney star Demi Lovato left the treatment center she voluntarily entered three months ago and returned to her home in Los Angeles this week, a source close to her family said.
Lovato, 18, dropped out of a world tour with the Jonas Brothers and sought help for "emotional and physical issues" in early November after an "altercation" with a dancer on her concert tour, a source close to Lovato's camp said at the time.
With her prescribed treatment and an outpatient program completed, Lovato is getting back into her regular routine and spending time with family and close friends, the family source said.
Her treatment for issues she was working on at the inpatient facility will continue with doctors in Los Angeles, the source said.
Little information had been made public about the issues, but a statement by her publicist in November described them as "emotional and physical issues she has dealt with for some time." The publicist cautioned against describing the treatment as "rehab."
"Demi has decided to take personal responsibility for her actions and seek help," the November statement said. "She is doing just that."
Last year, Lovato also suffered a public end to a short romance with Joe Jonas, one of the three brothers she had been traveling the world with.
The 18-year-old singer-actress has talked extensively about being bullied while in middle school.
"People say sticks and stones may break your bones, but names can never hurt you, but that's not true," Lovato wrote on a anti-bullying website in October. "Words can hurt. They hurt me. Things were said to me that I still haven't forgotten."
Along with her solo music career, Lovato co-starred in Disney's "Camp Rock" movies with the Jonases. She also has the lead role in Disney's TV series "Sonny With a Chance."
