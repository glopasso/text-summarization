CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta was near the scene of a small plane crash Saturday afternoon on the campus of the University of Florida.
Maj. Brad Barber of the University of Florida Police Department told Gupta the plane had been carrying a banner above the area around the school's football stadium.
According to Barber, the plane crash-landed into a truck parked adjacent to a field being used by tailgaters before Florida's football game against the University of Arkansas.
No one on the ground was hit or injured, and the pilot and passenger -- who emerged from the cockpit under their own power -- were taken to a local hospital with minor injuries, Gupta said.
Alachua County Fire Chief Mike Cowart told CNN the plane had mechanical problems and attempted an emergency landing in Flavet Field just hours before the scheduled kickoff.
