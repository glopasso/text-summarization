Police gave the all clear Tuesday after investigating a suspicious package found at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The package was found in the lobby of a building at the CDC's Roybal Campus, located near Emory University northeast of downtown Atlanta, according to DeKalb County Police spokeswoman Mekka Parish.
She later said the scene was clear. Police did not indicate what the package was.
Aerial footage from CNN affiliate WSB showed fire and other emergency vehicles responding to the incident.
Offices near the package were evacuated, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said before the all clear was given.
The CDC is a federal agency that works to promote public health in the United States and around the world.
CNN's Saundra Young contributed to this report.
