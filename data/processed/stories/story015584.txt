"Real Housewives of D.C." star Michaele Salahi hit the road with Journey guitarist Neal Schon and was not kidnapped as her husband suspected, according to a representative with Schon's management company.
She told a sheriff's deputy late Tuesday that she was "with a good friend and was where she wanted to be," Warren County, Virginia, Sheriff Danny McEathron said in a statement to CNN Wednesday afternoon.
The reality show personality traveled to Memphis on Tuesday, where Journey was performing, to be with Schon, the representative with Scoop Marketing confirmed to CNN Wednesday afternoon.
Tareq Salahi, speaking through his manager on Wednesday morning, told CNN his wife had been missing since Tuesday morning and may have been kidnapped.
"It is our belief as of last night Michaele Salahi may have been kidnapped or abducted and is being held under duress and forced to tell persons, including authorities, she is OK," manager Gina Rodriguez said.
CNN's Carol Cratty, Rachel Wells and Jack Hannah contributed to this report.
