Iran hanged two men Monday for their actions during post-election unrest in 2009, state media reported, months after the United States' secretary of state called for Iran to drop the "imminent" executions.
Iran's Press TV described the men as terrorists and members of the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO).
Jafar Kazemi and Mohammad Ali Haj Aqaei were hanged on Monday "for distributing placards and photos of the terrorist group, making videos and images during the post-election unrest in Iran in 2009 and chanting slogans in favor of the MKO," the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
In an August 2010 statement, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged the Iranian government to halt the executions of the men who were "exercising their right to free expression."
"The United States is deeply concerned that Iran continues to deny its citizens their civil rights and intimidate and detain those Iranians who seek to hold their government accountable and stand up for the rights of their fellow citizens," the statement read.
"... We are also concerned about the fate of Iranians who are in danger of imminent execution for exercising their right to free expression after the June 2009 elections, including Jafar Kazemi, Mohammad Haj Aghaei, and Javad Lari. The United States urges the Iranian Government to halt these executions in accordance with its obligations to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and calls for the immediate release of all political prisoners and imprisoned human rights defenders."
