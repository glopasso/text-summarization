Miley Cyrus has a message for the haters: You are overthinking it.
The singer has broken her silence regarding the MTV Video Music Awards performance that set tongues wagging (and some other parts shaking as folks tried to imitate her twerking).
Cyrus, in an interview feature on that network's site, said she doesn't "pay attention to the negative."
Wait, Miley did what?!
"Me and Robin (Thicke) the whole time said, 'You know we're about to make history right now,' " Cyrus said in a clip provided to MTV.
Cyrus' dance routine and provocative outfit were the talk of the VMAs, and the former child star is fully aware they have garnered her what most celebs covet -- the public's attention.
Opinion: Miley is sexual, get over it
She points out in the clip that what she did is nothing new.
Let's not let Robin Thicke off the hook
"How many times have we seen this play out in pop music?" Cyrus asked. "Madonna's done it, Britney's done it. Every VMA performance. Anyone that performs, that's what you're looking for. You are wanting to make history."

She goes on to say in the clip, which was reportedly recorded three days after the performance, that it's amazing how much buzz the whole thing has garnered.
"You are thinking about it more than I thought about it when I did it," Cyrus said. "I didn't even think about it when I did it because that's just me."
