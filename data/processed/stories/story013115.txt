The call girl involved in the sex scandal with former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer filed a lawsuit Monday suing the founder of the "Girls Gone Wild" video series for more than $10 million.
Ashley Alexandra Dupre says she posed for "Girls Gone Wild" as a teen.
In the complaint filed in Miami, Florida, Ashley Alexandra Dupre says she was vacationing in Miami Beach when she was approached by agents and representatives of the defendant, Joe Francis, and offered alcoholic drinks.
While intoxicated, Dupre was persuaded to expose her breasts and then told to sign a release form, according to a statement from her legal counsel, Richard C. Wolfe. Wolfe contends that Dupre "was 17 years old and therefore not legally competent to enter into a contract with the defendants."
Dupre was the high-priced call girl, known as "Kristen," documented in court papers as the woman Spitzer arranged to meet at Washington's Mayflower Hotel in February. Spitzer's involvement turned up in a federal investigation of suspicious transfers from his checking account.
The investigation led agents to the alleged organizers of a prostitution ring, four of whom were charged in a criminal complaint in March. Spitzer resigned when a leak identified him as a client of the ring.
In March, Francis was negotiating to pay Dupre $1 million to appear in the "Girls Gone Wild" magazine and on the company's touring bus. The deal fell through when Francis found he already owned video footage of Dupre.
Francis said Monday he and his company "have nothing to worry about."
"But I think it's ironic that she charged Gov. Spitzer $2,000 for sex and she wants to charge me 10 million for taking some naked pictures of her," Francis told CNN. "I feel like I'm getting a raw deal." E-mail to a friend
