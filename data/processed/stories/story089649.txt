(CNN)A Colorado woman whose fetus was cut from her womb in a stabbing attack last week has been released from the hospital, relatives say.
Michelle Wilkins thought she was answering a Craigslist ad for baby clothes on March 18 in Longmont.
Instead, when she arrived at the purported seller's home, authorities say, she was attacked, beaten and her fetus was surgically removed. The baby did not survive.
Dynel Lane, 34, has been held on $2 million bond as authorities weigh charges against the former nurse aide.
While the attack on Wilkins has shocked her community for its brutality, many have also remarked on the 26-year-old's strength.
Bleeding and stunned in a stranger's basement, Wilkins managed to lock herself in a room to prevent any further violence, called 911 and did what she could to stem the bleeding.
Police officers Billy Sawyer and Phil Piotrowski, who responded to the call, told CNN affiliate KDVR they weren't prepared for the grisly scene.
"She was covered from head to toe in blood," Sawyer said.
Piotrowski told the station that Wilkins "saved her own life," describing her as " probably one of the strongest people I've ever had the pleasure to meet."
Wilkins is now out of the hospital, according to a family statement posted on their GoFundMe page, and she's "in a safe location" and "surrounded by family and friends."
More than $65,000 has been raised so far.
