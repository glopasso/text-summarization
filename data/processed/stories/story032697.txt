As mobile devices get increasingly slimmer, so too will their corresponding USB connectors.
Even better, you won't have to flip the cable when you try to slip it in upside down. Finally.
Development for the next-generation USB connector, called the Type-C, is underway and will be thinner and sleeker than current USB 3.0 cables (pictured above), according to the USB 3.1 Promoter Group, which is made up of industry heavy hitters including Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard and Intel.

To pack the powerful punch of the USB 3.1 standard, which can move data at 10 gigabits per second, into a smaller cable, it will closely resemble the USB 2.0 Micro-B.
But it has a few advantages over existing models: Specifically, it's reversible, meaning users no longer need to worry about plug orientation.
The plug design is similar to Apple's Lightning cables and will take away one of USB's main frustrations. The downside is that the new cables won't work with existing connectors.
The Type-C connector is built on existing USB 3.1 and USB 2.0 technologies and will have scalable power capabilities, meaning it will be able to charge a wide range of gadgets.
"While USB technology is well established as the favored choice for connecting and powering devices, we recognize the need to develop a new connector to meet evolving design trends in terms of size and usability," said Brad Saunders, USB 3.0 Promoter Group Chairman, in a statement. "The new Type-C connector will fit well with the market's direction and affords an opportunity to lay a foundation for future versions of USB."
The organization said the Type-C connector will be completed by mid-2014.
