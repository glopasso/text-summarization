It might feel like a throwback to the 1990s at this year's Lollapalooza.
Eminem and Outkast are set to headline the annual massive music festival held in Grant Park, Chicago, along with acts including Kings of Leon, Lorde, Calvin Harris, Arctic Monkeys and Skrillex.
It will be just one of the stops for the members of Outkast, who recently announced they would be reuniting. Other acts for 2014's Lollapalooza include Zedd, Nas, Broken Bells, Fitz & the Tantrums, Chvrches, Childish Gambino, Bombay Bicycle Club, and Chicago's own Chance the Rapper, featured in the CNN original series "Chicagoland."
Last year's festival drew hundreds of thousands of visitors.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of Lollapalooza's revival -- the festival ran for seven years in the 1990s and was brought back in 2003. In celebration there will be more than 130 acts performing on eight stages. The festival runs August 1-3. By Wednesday most tickets were already sold out.
