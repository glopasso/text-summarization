An airstrike targeted a key Palestinian militant involved in numerous rocket attacks on Israel, the latter's military said Sunday.
Abdallah Kharti is a key operative for the Popular Resistance Committees, according to the Israel defense forces. The group opposes peace talks with Israel.
The Israeli air force conducted the airstrike on Gaza on Sunday, the military said.
Conflicting reports emerged on Kharti's condition. The Israeli military said Kharti was killed, but the Popular Resistance Committees group said one of its members survived an attack in Gaza. It did not identify that person.
Thirty-three rockets have been launched from Gaza into Israel this year, according to the Israeli military.
CNN's Talal Abu-Rahma contributed to this report.
