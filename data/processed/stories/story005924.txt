Former British pop star Gary Glitter was arrested Thursday and charged with committing eight sex offenses against two teenage girls more than three decades ago.
Glitter, 70, whose real name is Paul Gadd, was known as a "glam rocker" in the 1970s for his flamboyant clothes and performing style. He sold 18 million records with hits like "I'm the Leader of the Gang," "I Love You Love Me Love" and "Rock 'n' Roll."
He was charged with six counts of indecent assault, one count of administering a drug to facilitate sexual intercourse and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under age 13, the Crown Prosecution Office said.
The offenses happened between 1977 and 1980 when the girls were 12 to 14 years old, the Crown Prosecution Office said.
There was not sufficient evidence to prosecute five allegations made by two other complainants, authorities said.
Glitter is scheduled to appear June 19 in court.
Glitter has been prosecuted previously on sex charges.
In 1999 he admitted possessing child pornography and was jailed for four months. While living in Vietnam he was convicted of sex offenses against young girls and jailed nearly three years before being deported to England.
Another British pop culture figure was accused of sex crimes in recent years.
In 2012, women came forward to allege television disc jockey and television star Jimmy Savile had sexually molested them decades earlier when they were in their mid-teens. Savile died in 2011 at age 84.
