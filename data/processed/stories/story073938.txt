Locksmiths have realistic personalities. They are results-driven, hands-on people who like problems and solutions.
Everyone knows how hard it is to get along with others when there's a personality clash -- so imagine how hard it is to be happy in career that does the same thing.
Similar to when you're looking for a mate, you want to find a career that complements your character, not conflicts with it.
For example, if you're active and outgoing, you might not do well sitting behind a desk all day. On the same token, if you're shy and soft-spoken, you might not do well in a job that requires a lot of social interaction, and if you like working alone, you wouldn't thrive in a team setting.
Here we have six personality groups which seem to encompass the majority of people. From there, we've listed what jobs might be suited to best fit your needs. Please note that each requires different education, training and qualification requirements.

What you're like: Artistic personalities are creative by nature, with imaginations that stretch further than others can conceive.
