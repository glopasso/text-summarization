The search of a pond in Bristol, Connecticut, in connection with the murder investigation involving Aaron Hernandez failed to turn up any new evidence, authorities said Tuesday.
"No evidence was recovered and, at the present time, no more dives are planned," Lt. Kevin Morrell told CNN's Susan Candiotti.
Investigators have refused to say what they were searching for, but a law enforcement source previously told CNN they were searching for the .45 caliber handgun believed to have been used to kill Odin Lloyd.
Authorities have conducted an extensive search at Pine Lake without success. They turned their attention to a small retention pond directly across the street from the lake on Tuesday.
Hernandez, the former New England Patriot, is charged with Lloyd's murder in Massachusetts last June and has pleaded not guilty.
