Police have arrested Scotland international striker Garry O'Connor on suspicion of possessing cocaine, according to the UK Press Association.
The striker, who is currently without a club, has recently been training with Glasgow side Celtic and has played for Birmingham City in the English Premier League and Lokomotiv Moscow in Russia.
He was allegedly caught with the Class A drug in the early hours of Saturday morning in the Scottish capital Edinburgh.
O'Connor, who is from Edinburgh, was reportedly detained by police but released without charge pending further enquiries.
After being released by Barnsley, who play in the second tier of English football, O'Connor has been training with Neil Lennon's Celtic, who narrowly missed out on the Scottish title to city rivals Rangers on Sunday. He has 16 Scotland caps.
The UK Press Association also reported that two players from Edinburgh club Hearts were allegedly caught with an illegal substance.
It said Ian Black, 26, and Robert Ogleby, 19, had been detained on suspicion of possessing a Class A drug and later released.
A spokeswoman for Lothian and Borders Police said: "We had two people detained, both were cautioned and charged."
