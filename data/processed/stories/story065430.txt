Former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt tells the story of her six-year captivity in a book due to hit the shelves Tuesday.
Betancourt, a former presidential candidate in Colombia, was held for more than six years by Marxist rebels before the Colombian military rescued her and 14 others in 2008.
"Meme le Silence a une Fin," or "Even Silence Has an End," will go on sale around the world, the publishing house Gallimard said.
In June, Betancourt filed a suit, asking for about $7 million from the Colombian government for the years she spent as a hostage.
Betancourt and her family members say the government did not do enough to protect her.
Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members.
In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp.
