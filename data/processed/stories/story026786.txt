(Rolling Stone) -- The Voice, indeed.
Javier Colon, the inaugural winner of NBC's hit talent contest "The Voice," has several pop star assets-pretty face, megawatt smile, rakishly-angled trilby.
But it's his pure-toned tenor voice, sitting cozily between an old-fashioned soul croon and a Mayer-Mraz-style sensitive-dude simper, that sets him apart.

"Come Through For You" is thoroughly catchy, from "Life is Getting Better" to "Stand Up," with guest vocals from his "Voice" mentor (and audible model) Adam Levine.

The music is pro forma radio pop; the lyrics lean towards insipid inspiration. ("Good things come in spades/To those who wait.") But it's hard to be cynical about music this pleasantly well-sung.
