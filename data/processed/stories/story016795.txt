A 32-year-old man was arrested and charged Friday in the beating of two New York Rangers fans outside a landmark restaurant after the Winter Classic hockey game on January 2.
Dennis Veteri, of Glassboro, New Jersey, is charged with aggravated and simple assault, conspiracy and recklessly endangering another person, according to the Philadelphia district attorney's office. Veteri turned himself in after an arrest warrant was issued and was arraigned shortly after 2 a.m., according to Philadelphia police.
The brawl occurred outside Geno's Steaks about an hour after the New York-Rangers Philadelphia Flyers game at the Wells Fargo Center. It was caught on video and posted on YouTube. Police are still looking for additional alleged assailants.
The video showed two males in Rangers jerseys being punched and kicked by three males wearing Flyers jerseys. The assault left Neal Auricchio, an off-duty Woodbridge, New Jersey, police officer and Iraq war veteran, unconscious and requiring stitches.
"It is a vicious beating with the conclusion of a knockdown punch which knocks the police officer unconscious to the ground upon which he's further assaulted on the ground," said Capt. Laurence Nodiff.
Veteri is out on $100,000 bail. He is scheduled to appear in court on January 31.
The district attorney's office will appeal the bail amount in court next week and seek an increase, according to spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson.
