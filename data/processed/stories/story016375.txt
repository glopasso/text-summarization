(CNN)Go, go, Gadget reboot!
"Inspector Gadget" is one of five kids' shows on tap for streaming giant Netflix, the company said in a release Wednesday. A remake of the super-popular '80s animated series is coming to the U.S. as part of the company's strategy to attract younger viewers.
"It's one of those shows where we're able to hit a few different audiences," said Erik Barmack, the company's VP of global independent content. "We think that kids are going to love the show ... but it's also going to get some co-viewing because there is a generation of parents who grew up on the original."
"Gadget" inspired a live-action movie starring Matthew Broderick in 1999. The new show promises an updated Gadget, with technological advances.
And the accident-prone mechanical detective is not the only one being revived.
Netflix has also ordered a revamp of the cartoon "Danger Mouse," about a secret agent rodent.
The 26 episodes of "Inspector Gadget" will premiere in the U.S. in March.
