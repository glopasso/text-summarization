A man who police said was 107 years old was killed in a confrontation with SWAT officers Saturday night.
Police were called to a home in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, where suspect Monroe Isadore was.
"When they arrived, they were able to determine that an aggravated assault had occurred against two people at the residence," Lt. David E. Price, a Pine Bluff police spokesman, said in a statement.
The two victims were led out of the house.
It was not clear what role the suspect had in the aggravated assaults or what they were.
When officers approached a bedroom where Isadore was hiding, he fired through the door, authorities said.
None of the police officers was hit by the gunfire. They retreated to a safer area and called for additional help, including SWAT officers who started negotiations with the suspect.
SWAT officers slipped a camera into the room where Isadore was holed up and saw he was armed with a handgun, Price said.
After unsuccessful negotiations, officers slipped gas into the room through a window, he said, and Isadore fired rounds at them.
The officers broke the bedroom door and hurled in a distraction device, and Isadore fired at them again, according to the spokesman's statement.
Officers returned fire, killing him.
It's unclear what distraction device was used. No more information was immediately available. CNN called the police department, but could not reach anyone.
In 2010, there were about 53,000 people over age 100 in the United States, according to the latest Census numbers. Only 8% of them were older than 104.
