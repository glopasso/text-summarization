Comedian Craig Ferguson says he's leaving his gig as host of "The Late Late Show" to pursue other projects.
"CBS and I are not getting divorced, we are 'consciously uncoupling,'" Ferguson said in a statement released by the network Monday, employing the infamous phrase actress Gwyneth Paltrow used to describe her recent split from singer Chris Martin.
"We will still spend holidays together and share custody of the fake horse and robot skeleton, both of whom we love very much," he added.
The Scottish-born comic announced his plans to step down as the show's host in December during a taping of the show Monday.
Nina Tassler, chairman of CBS Entertainment, said in a statement that it was Ferguson's choice to leave.
"We respect his decision to move on," she said, "and we look forward to celebrating his final broadcasts during the next eight months."
Tassler praised Ferguson's "versatile talents as a writer, producer, actor and comedian."
"He infused the broadcast with tremendous energy, unique comedy, insightful interviews and some of the most heartfelt monologues seen on television," she said.
Ferguson has hosted the show since 2005. When David Letterman announced this month that he would retire from "The Late Show" in 2015, some suggested Ferguson might be the man to replace him. But that job went to Comedy Central funnyman Stephen Colbert.
