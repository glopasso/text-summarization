The "Frozen" and "House of Lies" actress is taking the same approach with Delta, her second daughter with husband Dax Shepard, who was born in December 2014. As you might remember, that's when measles reached the outbreak stage in the United States.

More and more parents in parts of California, especially around cities such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, choose to opt out of vaccinating their children under the "personal belief exemption." Dr. Nina L. Shapiro of Mattel Children's Hospital UCLA told The Hollywood Reporter that schools with large numbers of unimmunized children compromise what's known as herd immunity.
"The non-vaccination rates in schools are astounding, and it is very dangerous," Shapiro told the magazine. "I think a school that has less than 90% of its children immunized is at very high risk for these diseases to start cropping up."
She's referring to diseases that have previously been eradicated or greatly reduced by the use of vaccines, including measles and whooping cough.
