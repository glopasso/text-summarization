It's here again -- the tournament that sees Africa's finest battle for footballing glory. South Africa is hosting the 29th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), welcoming 16 teams from across the continent.
Holders Zambia will be looking to defend last year's fairytale triumph when they won their first-ever AFCON title after beating a star-studded Ivory Coast team in a dramatic penalty shootout.
The tournament kicks off on 19 January, with the host nation taking on debutants Cape Verde in Johannesburg. The final takes place on February 10.
