Watch out Bermuda, here comes Hurricane Gonzalo.
The powerful system strengthened to a Category 4 storm early Thursday as it churned through the North Atlantic with wind speeds of 140 miles per hour, the National Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
The storm is expected to brush Bermuda on Friday, but Gonzalo's path could still vary enough that officials aren't ruling out a direct hit on the island.
Bermuda is now under a hurricane warning. Gonzalo is expected to cause powerful, gusty winds, heavy rains of up to 6 inches and flooding as it closes in.
The storm hit the Virgin Islands on Monday, causing some property damage and power outages.
Meantime, Tropical Storm Ana in the Pacific also is on the radar.
The storm could reach hurricane status by this weekend, according to forecasters.
Ana's winds measured 60 miles per hour, under hurricane strength. It is forecast to intensify into at least a Category 1 hurricane with wind gusts up to 100 miles per hour by Friday, officials said.
If it stays on its current track, it will directly impact the Hawaiian Islands by this weekend into early Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center.
Hurricanes are a rare occurrence in Hawaii, the agency said. Only three storms have made a direct landfall on the islands in the past 55 years.
