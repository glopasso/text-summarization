(CNN)  -- Female suicide bombers detonated explosions that rocked two subway stations in central Moscow during rush hour on Monday morning, killing dozens of people, officials said.
A Web site associated with Chechen separatists, who have long fought for independence from Russia, claimed responsibility for the attacks. Immediately after the explosions, officials had cast suspicion on the separatists.
