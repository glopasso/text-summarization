(EW.com) -- Gordon Ramsay is expanding beyond cooking and setting his sights on a new makeover target: Hotels.
Fox has ordered a new Ramsay series where the reality kingpin will partner with a team of hospitality experts, traveling across the country to try and fix every aspect of struggling hotels, motels and bed & breakfasts. The working title: "Hotel Hell."
The series is both familiar territory for Ramsay and a real departure, combining the business makeover format of "Kitchen Nightmares" with the internationally known chef moving beyond a cooking-centric show on Fox for the first time. Ramsay has hotel experience, having studied hotel management as a young man, and having worked and owned hotel-based restaurants throughout his career.

With this series, and presuming his other franchises continue, Ramsay will have four shows on the air, more than any other broadcast network reality TV personality -- including "Hell's Kitchen," "Kitchen Nightmares" and "MasterChef."
"Gordon is amazing to work with and no matter what the premise, he delivers every time," said Mike Darnell, president of alternative entertainment at Fox. "With an unprecedented three shows already on the air, Gordon is an incredible television success, and we're really thrilled to put him through 'Hotel Hell.' "

Added Ramsay in a statement: "These are stories that everyone can relate to, because virtually all of us have had a bad hotel experience that's turned a holiday or business trip into a total disaster. It's time to put the hospitality industry to the test."
Ramsay, Adeline Ramage Rooney, Patricia Llewellyn and Ben Adler are executive producers on the project, which does not yet have an air date.
