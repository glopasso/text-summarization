On Thursday, DC Comics gave the first close-up look at Affleck's caped hero, offering a profile photo of the newest Bruce Wayne as part of a montage honoring Batman's 75th anniversary.

Affleck himself hasn't been spotted, but he's probably busy with director Zack Snyder's production schedule. Work on "Batman v Superman" is under way, with plans to shoot in Detroit and international locales.
Also starring Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor and Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Snyder's "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice" will open May 6, 2016.
