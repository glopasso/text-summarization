(CNN)So, you'd like a "Full House" reunion and spinoff? You got it, dude!
Co-star John Stamos announced Monday night on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" that Netflix has ordered up a reunion special, followed by a spinoff series called "Fuller House."
The show will feature Candace Cameron Bure, who played eldest daughter D.J. Tanner in the original series -- which aired from 1987 to 1995 -- as the recently widowed mother of three boys.
"It's sort of a role reversal, and we turn the house over to her," Stamos told Kimmel.
Jodie Sweetin, who played Stephanie Tanner in the original series, and Andrea Barber, who portrayed D.J.'s best friend Kimmy Gibbler, will both return for the new series, Netflix said.
Stamos will produce and guest star. Talks with co-starsBob Saget, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Dave Coulier and Lori Loughlin are ongoing, Netflix said.
The show will be available next year, Netflix said.
"As big fans of the original Full House, we are thrilled to be able to introduce Fuller House's new narrative to existing fans worldwide, who grew up on the original, as well as a new generation of global viewers that have grown up with the Tanners in syndication,"  Netflix Vice President of Original Content Cindy Holland said in a statement.
The show starts with Tanner -- now named Tanner-Fuller (get it ... Fuller?) -- pregnant, recently widowed and living in San Francisco.
Her younger sister Stephanie -- now an aspiring musician -- and her lifelong best friend and fellow single mom, Kimmy, move in to help her care for her two boys and the new baby.
On Monday, Barber tweeted Cameron Bure to ask whether she was ready to resume their onscreen friendship.
"We never stopped," Cameron Bure tweeted back.
Fans were over the moon at the news.
