South African golf was handed another boost on Tuesday when the country was awarded the right to host one of the lucrative World Golf Championships events for the next five years.
The news comes after Charl Schwartzel joined 2010 British Open winner Louis Oosthuizen as a reigning major champion with his dramatic victory at the Masters on Sunday.
"This is, without doubt, the most significant milestone in the history of professional golf in South Africa," Sunshine Tour commissioner Gareth Tindall said on his return from Augusta following meetings with the U.S. PGA Tour and the International Federation of PGA Tours.
"It is something that we have been working on for a long time, and the unanimous support that we have received from the other professional tours around the world confirms the major standing of our players and the Sunshine Tour in world golf.
"What is even more significant is that we have the commitment that we will host this World Golf Championships event for a period of five years. That has enormously positive implications for the game and for our country as a whole."

The three of the four WGC events held in the U.S. have prize money higher than the season's four major tournaments, while the HSBC Champions in China is comparable.
The date and venue for South Africa's first staging next year have yet to be announced, but it will feature the top 70 players in the world.
Meanwhile, this year's South African Open has been moved back a week to ensure the tournament will not clash with the President's Cup in Australia due to be held from November 17-20, with several players from the country expected to feature in the International team to take on the United States.
The Alfred Dunhill Championship will be played during the week of the Melbourne event.
