The security chief at One World Trade Center in New York City has stepped down after embarrassing security breaches at the site.
David Velazquez, a former FBI agent, resigned Friday, said Jordan Barowitz, director of external affairs for the Durst Organization. The Durst Organization handles security on the inside of the building and the Port Authority is in charge of the grounds.
A few weeks ago Justin Casquejo, 16, sneaked past security and made his way to the 104th floor of the 1,776-foot building, the tallest in the United States.
On Monday, four men were arrested for a base jumping stunt at the building. Authorities said three men slipped through security September 30 and parachuted from the building while a fourth man stood lookout on the ground.
Velazquez had been with Durst since 2013 and took the top security job in January 2014. Barowitz said the resignation is not immediate. A successor has not been named.
