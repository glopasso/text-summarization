The Mockingjay lives.
On Monday, fans eager for more Katniss Everdeen got a sneak peek of the heroine in action in the first official trailer for "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I."
In the trailer, the "Hunger Games" heroine, played by Jennifer Lawrence, is seen fanning the flames of a rebellion while on a quest to save her Games partner, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson). And since this is Katniss, she does it all while toting a bow and arrow and teaming up with childhood friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).
"I never wanted any of this," Katniss tells her enemy President Snow in the nearly two-minute clip. "I never wanted to be in the Games. I just wanted to save my sister and keep Peeta alive."
"Ms. Everdeen, it's the things we love most that destroy us," Snow, played by Donald Sutherland, ominously replies.
The star-studded cast of "Mockingjay" also includes Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Julianne Moore, Sam Claflin and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, the leader behind the dark rebellion against the privileged Capitol.
"Mockingjay -- Part 1" is the second to last "Hunger Games" movie based on the popular young adult books by Suzanne Collins.
The new trailer started trending on Twitter on Monday, with fans sharing their excitement about the movie's November 21 debut.
"I should calm myself down first bc the tears in my eyes are not allowing me to watch clearly the trailer," tweeted one fan, while another asked, "Is it November yet?"
Let the countdown to "Mockingjay -- Part I" begin.
