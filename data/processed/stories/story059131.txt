He left it late but Sergio Garcia finally won his first tournament of the year.
The Spaniard beat the world's hottest golfer, Henrik Stenson, to claim the Thailand Golf Championship on Sunday.
Struggling in the past to close out events, this time Garcia protected his overnight advantage and downed the Swede by four shots at the Amata Spring Country Club in Chonburi.
The secret to his success? Maybe it was his girlfriend, Katharina, acting as his caddy.
"It was great, an amazing week ... obviously being the last week of the year and for having Katharina caddie for me," Garcia told the Asian Tour's website.
"I knew Henrik was going to make it difficult for me. He's been playing so amazingly great, and he did. He kept hitting good shot after good shot."
But Garcia wouldn't be caught.
He carded a four-under-par 68 in the final round and ended at 22-under overall.
Stenson, the Race to Dubai and FedExCup champion, admitted he was running on "fumes" after a tiring season.
"I've had a great year but coming here really on the fumes left in the tank, not too much going for me to perform in that sense," Stenson said. "But I played really nicely yesterday and I was hanging in there today. I was just coming up a couple short."
France's Alexander Levy completed the top three, with U.S. Open champion Justin Rose tying for fourth.
