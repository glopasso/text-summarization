Lowe's has pulled its advertising from the reality TV show "All-American Muslim," which the retail store called a "lightning rod."
"All-American Muslim" is an eight-part series that follows five Muslim families living in Dearborn, Michigan.
"Lowe's has received a significant amount of communication on this program, from every perspective possible. Individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic, and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views. As a result we did pull our advertising on this program," the company said in a statement Saturday.
"We believe it is best to respectfully defer to communities, individuals and groups to discuss and consider such issues of importance."
The conservative Florida Family Association, which is pushing advertisers to drop "All-American Muslim," cheered Lowe's decision. The group called the TLC show "propaganda that riskily hides the Islamic agenda's clear and present danger to American liberties and traditional values."
But the company's decision was decried by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and at least one of the show's cast members.
Both CAIR and Shadia Amen-McDermott, who is featured on the show, posted links on their Facebook pages to a petition, calling on advertisers to continue their support.
Late Saturday night, the petition had some 2,300 signatures.
"This is NOT about standing up for All-American Muslim - This is about Standing Up Against Bigotry and Hatred in this Country Founded on Peace, Justice, and Equality. Let's Stand United against Bigotry," Amen-McDermott wrote.
