Twenty-six year old Brazilian footballer Kaka is at the subject of negotiations about a salary that could see him earn nearly 95 times more than what Barack Obama will be paid when he enters the White House.
Pay rise: Kaka could soon be earning $726,000 per week
Reports circulated Wednesday that the AC Milan midfielder is being offered a £500,000 ($726,000) per WEEK salary by English Premier League club Manchester City.
A statement on Italy's Mediaset Web site appeared to suggest he will turn down the offer, however Manchester City officials insist the talks are ongoing.
Even if he declines the move, the offer is far beyond the pay for many other high-profile jobs.
For example, the U.S. President receives about $7690 per week, while British Prime Minister Gordon Brown receives around $5233.

A comparison of a variety of salaries shows just how highly footballers, and professional sportsmen and women are paid in relation to other jobs. Even current football salaries dwarf the pay for most executive positions and public offices.
WEEKLY INCOME (approximate)
U.S. President:                $7690
British PM Gordon Brown: $5233
Band 5 nurse in Britain:     $567
Director-General of BBC:   $22,800
Average U.S. teacher:       $915
Cristiano Ronaldo:            $177,345
Lewis Hamilton:                $391,593
Kaka's reported offer:        $726,881
If Kaka's deal does proceed, he will earn more than triple the Premier League's current highest-paid player, Robinho. The Brazilian, also with Manchester City, earns approximately $232,580 per week.
Manchester City is owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan of Abu Dhabi, a man believed to be worth about $22 billion -- so funding the salary shouldn't be a problem.
Kaka's current salary at AC Milan was believed to be about $208,000 per week.
