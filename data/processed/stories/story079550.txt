As Parisians head to the polls for a second round of municipal elections this Sunday, one of two women could become Paris' first "Madame le Maire".
On the left is the Socialist candidate, Spanish-born Anne Hidalgo, 54, the deputy mayor under Paris' incumbent Bertrand Delanoë.
On the right is Natalie Kosciusko-Morizet, 40, a former minister in Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right government.
As women have long been underrepresented in French politics, this upcoming local election is expected to be an historic one.
Today, women make up 26.9% of National Assembly députés, while in local politics they account for just 13.9%.
