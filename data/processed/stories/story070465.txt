(EW.com) -- Any existing physical copies of Nora Ephron's "Crazy Salad: Some Things about Women" and "Scribble, Scribble: Notes on the Media" are probably well-worn, underlined, and doggy-eared by now.
"Crazy Salad" and "Scribble, Scribble" have been out-of-print as solo volumes since 1991 and 1984, respectively. Vintage will give these two landmark books a fresh printing as a single volume come October 16. They will also be available in their entirety as e-books for the first time on that date.
"Crazy Salad," originally published in 1975, contains Ephron's famous, oft-quoted essay, "A Few Words About Breasts."
After Ephron died in June, did you go looking for her backlist only to have trouble finding these two titles?
