A Cirque du Soleil performer was in stable condition after falling from the "Wheel of Death" during a Las Vegas performance Friday night, the acrobatic circus company said Saturday.
The Montreal-based company did not identify the performer, but spokeswoman Ann Paladie said he is expected to be released from a hospital in the next few days.
The performer slipped during a performance of "Zarkana" at the Aria Resort and Casino, Paladie said.
The "Wheel of Death" is a large rotating apparatus with a ring about 8 feet in diameter at each end. Performers walk in, and even outside, the rings as the entire device rotates.
On Tuesday, the Nevada Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed fines of more than $25,000 for Cirque du Soleil for safety violations in the June 29 death of a performer Sarah Guillot-Guyard, who fell nearly 100 feet after a wire broke during a performance of the "Ka" show at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. The agency proposed fines of $7,000 for the casino.
Both companies defended their safety procedures and said they would appeal the fines.
