Fourteen people were killed in a fire at a rehabilitation center on the outskirts of Lima, Peru, the state-run Andina news agency reported Saturday.
It was not immediately clear what started the blaze, which was the second of its kind in the country this year.
"We found 14 bodies. The majority were on the second floor, in rooms and in hallways. ... It's possible that they were trying to escape, but the doors and windows were closed," said fire chief Fernando Campos, Andina reported.
The blaze at the Sacred Heart of Jesus center was controlled by firefighters, he said.
Twenty-nine people were killed and others were injured in January when a fire broke out at another rehabilitation center in Lima, according to Andina.
Some 40 people were housed in a small space with only one exit that was locked with a chain, the news agency reported at the time, citing a fire official. Bypassing a heavy metal door was the biggest challenge in that rescue.
