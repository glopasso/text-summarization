A Taliban attack near Kabul International Airport ended Thursday morning with all six insurgents dead, the Afghan interior ministry said.
The gunmen had taken over a half-completed building in an assault that included explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and machine-gun fire, police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said
The building where the firefight took place was located in a settlement a few hundred meters outside the grounds of the airport.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying the militant group was targeting the military side of the airport.
The assault temporarily halted operations on the civilian side of the facility.
There were no casualties among Afghan security forces or civilians, the ministry said.
