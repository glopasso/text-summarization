Now that Amy Poehler and Tina Fey have secured their spot on the Golden Globes stage through 2015, what do they have to say about how things went last year and what audiences can expect in the future? Well, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association talked with Poehler this morning about her initial hosting experience and what her job as co-host really means.

"Well last year was really fun! We didn't know what to expect. It was exciting to work with Tina, as always, and it was a strange experience," Poehler said. "We had a lot of fun so we said maybe we can try it again and like fools we are giving it another shot. Looking forward to understanding more of how the night goes and what works and what doesn't. In all honesty — just setting the tone for a really fun evening. I think as a host that's your job. Telling some jokes, getting everyone excited and then stay out of everyone's way."
And now that the gig is booked, when will Poehler and Fey get together and start working on their best jokes? Believe it or not, not right away. "I can't stress enough how little we will prepare until very close to the show. We'll treat it like Weekend Update — its a little SNL style and have to work backwards. We get a lot of jokes, write our own, talk bits and we work through them. You can't really do this kind of stuff too early and you can't overthink it," Poehler said.

But planning aside, the highlight of Poehler's hosting duties last year (a.k.a. the thing that probably helped get her back) will surprise absolutely no one. "My highlight was sitting on George Clooney's lap. But it all felt like a highlight."
Everyone saw that answer coming, right?
