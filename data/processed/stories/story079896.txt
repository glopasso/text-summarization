A U.S. military aircraft suffered a pressurization loss Saturday morning over the Atlantic Ocean, prompting it to be diverted "as a precaution," an Air Force spokesman said.
The C-5, a military cargo plane carrying 25 passengers and crew, was 34,000 feet high "when the aircraft experienced a loss of pressurization shortly after 11 a.m.," said 1st Lt. Andre Bowser, a spokesman at Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts.
The plane was supposed to go to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, but instead was redirected to Westover, Bowser said. The C-5 was diverted to that base, where it is currently assigned, "for maintenance," he said.
"No injuries were reported, and no in-flight emergency was declared," Bowser said.
Video footage shot after 2 p.m. showed the C-5 on the ground in Massachusetts, with people leaving the aircraft.
