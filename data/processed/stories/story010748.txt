The era of "Breaking Bad" is truly coming to an end -- and one of the stars is having some fun with it.
Aaron Paul announced on Instagram Wednesday night that he will be hosting a "Breaking Bad" scavenger hunt in Los Angeles on the day of the Primetime Emmy Awards in honor of the show's final nominations.
"There will be signed 'Breaking Bad' scripts, posters, dolls, action figures and some really cool 'Breaking Bad' art hidden all over the Hollywood area," Paul wrote. "Just wanted to do a little something to say 'Thank You' to everyone that has supported us thru out the years. We couldn't have done it without you!"
The acclaimed series, which aired its final episode on September 29, 2013, garnered 16 Emmy nominations this year, including outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for Paul for his portrayal as Jesse Pinkman.

While the show is gone, it is in no way forgotten. From oddsmakers picking it to do well at the awards to an Emmys "Breaking Bad" spoof, the series seems to be as beloved as it ever was when it was still airing.
The 66th Primetime Emmys will air August 25 on NBC.
