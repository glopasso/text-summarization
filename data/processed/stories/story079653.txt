"The sea, once it casts its spell, holds one in its net of wonder forever." -- French explorer Jacques Cousteau
It's said that the ocean is like space: Vast and filled with life, most of which we have yet to discover. The aquatic frontier captivates those who dare to explore its depths, by offering a new realm filled with color and mystery.
In 1968, with the advent of color TV, French explorer Jacques Cousteau introduced viewers to the deep blue sea with his show, "The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau," which used underwater cinematography to bring the beauty and wonder of the ocean to viewers around the globe.
