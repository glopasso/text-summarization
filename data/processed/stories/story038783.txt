A storm over southwestern Mexico weakened further Saturday to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said.
Carlotta was expected to continue to drench the area for another day or two, but all warnings and watches were discontinued.
The tropical depression was located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north-northeast of the resort town of Acapulco, the center said in its 11 a.m ET advisory.
It was moving toward the northwest at about 12 mph (19 kph), and the depression or its remnants would "meander" in the area for up to two days, the hurricane center said.
At least two children were killed when Carlotta slammed southern Mexico at hurricane strength, unleashing fierce winds and dumping intense rains over Oaxaca state.
The storm destroyed a clay house Friday night in Pluma Hidalgo, killing a 13-year-old girl and her 7-year-old sister, said Cynthia Tobar, a spokeswoman for Mexico's civil protection agency.
The girls' mother was seriously injured and taken to a hospital in the city of Huatulco, Tobar said.
According to preliminary reports, Carlotta ripped off the roofs of homes and caused widespread power outages and small landslides, Tobar said. Authorities will survey the area once daylight comes and and the weather conditions are favorable.
In the mountain community of Pluma Hidalgo, about 1,200 people are in shelters, Tobar said. Many more evacuated to stay with relatives or friends, she said.
Carlotta is expected to leave total rainfall accumulations of 4 to 8 inches through Monday over parts of southern Mexico, with as much as 15 inches of rain in isolated areas, the hurricane center said.
"These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides," the hurricane center said.
