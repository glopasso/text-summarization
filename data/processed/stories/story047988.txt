Austin, Texas (CNN)  -- "The State I'm In" columnist Brendan Newnam recently spent time in Austin, Texas during the SXSW conference and festival.
Here are his Austin essentials:
Eat
Franks  Don't let the font and the word "artisan" distract you. This place is about hot dogs and cold beer.
Barley Swine One of Austin's top food trailers, Odd Duck, has grown up and become a tasty, local gastropub.
Olivia The best non-sushi restaurant in Austin. Everyone tells you so and everyone is right.
Franklin Barbecue Yes, Iron Works is good, Stubb's is more than adequate and, if you have a couple hours, the Salt Lick experience is divine, but none of their BBQ is any better than Franklin's.
Drink
Lala's -- The best dive bar in Austin celebrates Christmas every day. 2207 Justin Lane; (512) 453-2521
Bar Congress Cocktailian Adam Bryant knows more than you about booze. Try to find a better martini in Texas. I did, but failed each time.
Mohawk Bar This is the real place. The spot where visiting cool kids and local kids unite, consume beer and nod to music.
Stay
The Driskill Pole position for everything Austin, with a touch of cowboy glamour.
Hotel San Jose A boutique hotel where I wish I stayed.
Courtyard Marriot, Austin  Where I stayed. The people were wonderful and never judged me for my 2 a.m. microwavable chimichanga attacks.
Play
