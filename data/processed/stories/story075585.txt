Debate all you want about a white guy from Minnesota using a fake Jamaican accent to capture the "Get Happy" spirit of Jamaica in Volkswagen's Super Bowl 2013 advertisement.
While debates about racism abound (see this debate on CNN), the Jamaica Tourism Board seems thrilled with the attention.
In response to the ad, Jamaica's tourism officials put together a "Get Happy in Jamaica" package for visitors to enjoy savings on travel April 1 through June 30.
Jamaican musician Jimmy Cliff, whose recording of "Come On, Get Happy" serves as background music, asked people to focus on the song's message via his Facebook page.
"I chose to record the song that's part of the Volkswagen Super Bowl campaign because it has a great message and it is something that people can apply to everyday life," Cliff wrote.
"I have personally seen the positive effects of Reggae music and Jamaican culture. I am a proud Jamaican and stand by this campaign, I feel like people need to focus on peace and unity. Blessed Love!"
The Jamaica Tourism Board deal offers a free hotel night at 20 participating hotels, contingent on the purchase of three to five nights. Book by March 15 at Visit Jamaica, click on the "Get Happy in Jamaica" link and use the code GET HAPPY. Seasonal surcharges and blackout dates may apply.
