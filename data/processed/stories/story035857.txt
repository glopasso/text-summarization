President Barack Obama will join Stephen Colbert as one of the final guests of "The Colbert Report" during a taping in Washington, D.C. on Monday.
With just eight episodes left before the satirical news show comes to a close, Colbert will interview Obama at The George Washington University's Lisner Auditorium. The appearance will be Obama's first on the show, minus a cameo appearance in 2009 via video "ordering" U.S. Army General Ray Odierno to shave Colbert's head.
Obama might have to brace for some post-midterm gloating from the faux-conservative host as the episode is titled, "Stephen Colbert Presents: Mr. Colbert Goes to Washington D.C. Ya Later, Legislator: Partisan is Such Sweet Sorrow: A Colbert Victory Lap, '014."
Colbert -- very much in character -- noted in a university release that "The Colbert Report" is no stranger to Washington, D.C., though the city may need to brace itself.
"Washington has been the Report's second home, and I will be returning on Monday to show it the same affection the British did in 1812," Colbert said.
Obama will be the second member of the first family to be interviewed by Colbert: Michelle Obama appeared on the program in 2012.
GW students got the chance to vie for free tickets to the taping this week, before Obama was announced as the show's guest.
Obama's visit to the university's campus will be his sixth, according to a university release.
Colbert previously appeared at the university's Lisner Auditorium in 2007 to discuss his book "I Am America (And So Can You!)" with the late Tim Russert of NBC News.
"The Colbert Report" is ending this year as Colbert takes over "The Late Show" from David Letterman in 2015.
