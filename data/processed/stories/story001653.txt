Friends and family of Holly Bobo, last seen in 2011, waited three years for news. Their worst fears have now been confirmed.
A man has been indicted on charges of kidnapping and murder in the case of the Tennessee woman, authorities announced Wednesday.
Zachary Adams, 29, is being held without bond.
A Decatur County grand jury handed down a two-count indictment of especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree murder.
"As this investigation continues, we are still asking for the public's help and support to help us continue to seek out justice regarding the disappearance of Holly Bobo," Mark Gwyn, director of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, told reporters.
Because the investigation is ongoing, Gwyn declined to comment on whether any human remains have been found.
Bobo, a nursing student, was last seen in April 2011. She was 20 years old.
Her brother told authorities he saw a man in camouflage leading her away from their home in the small town of Darden.
The Bobo case rocked the largely rural swath of central Tennessee, from those who knew the young woman to others who rallied behind the effort to find her.
Hundreds of volunteers -- some on horseback and foot, others on all-terrain vehicles -- turned out to hunt for clues in Decatur, Henderson, Henry, Carroll and Benton counties. Many more attended memorial services or offered supportive thoughts online via groups on Facebook.
The TBI and local and federal authorities have spent hundreds of manpower hours on the case, Gwyn said. More than $450,000 has been offered in reward money.
Adams, who is being held at the Chester County jail, is set to appear in court on Tuesday. Prosecutors are evaluating whether they will seek the death penalty.
"Obviously, they're devastated," Gwyn said of the Bobo family.
"They've been devastated for three years. But, hopefully, this is the beginning of closure for the Bobo family, and they deserve that."
