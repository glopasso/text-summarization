Baseball Hall of Famer Bob Feller died Wednesday night in Cleveland, Ohio, of acute leukemia, according to a statement from the Cleveland Indians. He was 92.
Feller was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in August and underwent surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to implant a pacemaker in October. In mid-November, Feller was hospitalized with pneumonia.
The major leaguer was an icon for Indians fans.
"We in Cleveland have been blessed to have had him with us these many years," said Indians owner Larry Dolan. "To say he will be missed is such an understatement."
Feller spent 18 years in a Cleveland Indians uniform. He started 484 games, winning 266 of them. Feller had a lifetime ERA of 3.25, threw three no-hitters, including the only Opening Day no-hitter in Major League Baseball history, on April 16, 1940. In 1946, he pitched 36 complete games.
"Since 1936 he has been with us. For 75 years he has been a contributing citizen, a model for all athletes, and friend of thousands," Dolan said. "As so it shall be in the larger sense, Bob will be with us always. Not at Opening Day, not at Fantasy Camp, not in the Press Box, but in our hearts."
Indians manager Manny Acta said Feller was a special person.
"There has never been a great one with such an affiliation to his original franchise," Acta said. "When you think Cleveland Indians, you think Bob Feller and vice-versa. He was a genuine patriot and a big-time Hall of Famer. Boy, he loved the Indians and we all loved him back."
