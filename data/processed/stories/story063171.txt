(CNN)How will the new "Fantastic Four" differ from the original movie of a decade ago?
For starters, as a new trailer shows, Sue and Johnny Storm's father initiates the project that ends up giving the foursome their powers.
They also end up in another dimension, and we see the early flirtation between Sue Storm and Reed Richards as well.
The movie, due out August 7, promises a very different take on the classic Marvel comics characters, played this go-round by Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Bell.
We also get our first glimpse of the villainous Dr. Doom in this new trailer, released Sunday. Fans on Twitter had mixed reactions.

The trailerpalooza of "Star Wars," "Batman v. Superman" and "Fantastic Four" kept sci-fi and superhero fans chattering all weekend.
Not to be outdone, the new trailer for "Jurassic World" came out Monday morning. It features even more of star Chris Pratt.
Pratt's scientist character knows dinosaurs better than anyone. After a genetically modified mutant dinosaur escapes from an island theme park along with others, he takes charge of a mission to contain the dangerous creatures.
(The trailer also includes part of a scene that caused controversy after Joss Whedon called it "sexist" last week.)
The movie is first in the rampaging-dino franchise since "Jurassic Park III" in 2001. And, as we see for the first time, the dinosaurs have learned to communicate with each other. Uh-oh.
Early word on Twitter was pretty good.
Here's the new trailer for the movie, out June 12:
