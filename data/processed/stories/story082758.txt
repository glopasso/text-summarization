(CNN)Like most young people, Bobbi Kristina Brown communicates a great deal via social media.
From her desire to launch a career in music and acting to her grief over the loss of her mother, singer Whitney Houston, the 21-year-old shares much with her followers.
Here is Brown in her own words.
From before her mother's death:
After Houston's death, she and Nick Gordon got matching tattoos with Houston's initials. The singer had reportedly taken Gordon in when he was 12 years old and raised him alongside her daughter.
Brown and Gordon became romantically involved after her mother's death, and in January 2014, she tweeted a picture of the pair with wedding rings, saying they were "happily married." He makes frequent appearances on her social media accounts, and she often speaks of her love for him.
In March, she was criticized for appearing too thin after tweeting a picture of herself in a bikini.
Brown defended her slim frame.
In August, she paid tribute on what would have been her mother's birthday, tweeting birthday wishes and a picture of a cake with candles.
In July, Brown reportedly went on a Twitter rant, expressing unhappiness with the Lifetime biopic "Whitney," directed by actress Angela Bassett.
The Houston family decried the family's lack of involvement in the project, and the singer's sister-in-law, Pat Houston, posted on Facebook, "I say this to all Whitney's family, friends and fan base: If you watch this movie, watch it knowing that Lifetime is notorious for making bad biopics of deceased celebrities and brace yourself for the worst."
Brown tweeted an apology after insulting Bassett.
Her communications sometimes center on her dislike of the attention paid to her life and decisions.
She also often speaks of missing her mother.
Brown's last tweet before she was found unresponsive in the bathtub at her Roswell, Georgia, home Saturday was one of optimism and excitement about her future.
