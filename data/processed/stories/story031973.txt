Children playing in a Texas suburb made a gruesome discovery Monday -- the decomposing body of a child on a residential street.
Authorities aren't sure who left the body under a tarp in Saginaw, a northern suburb of Fort Worth.
So far, police have very few clues.
"We are looking for a red truck. We don't have a model or a make," Saginaw police spokesman Damon Ing told CNN.
He said the truck has green paint splattered on its right rear quarter panel.
Police said they don't know the child's identity and would not disclose the child's gender.
CNN affiliate KTVT said no children from the area have been reported missing. KTVT said the body was decomposed, making it difficult for officials to determine the child's gender.
