New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will speak at U.S. Rep. Steve King's annual pheasant hunt in Iowa this month -- but he won't be shooting game himself.
Ann Trimble-Ray, an advisor to the King reelection campaign, said Christie will be present at a fundraising luncheon in Iowa on Saturday, but he won't be hunting because he's on a campaign swing visiting other candidates.
"His schedule doesn't allow him to do more with the congressman," she said.
Christie would 'rather die' than serve in U.S. Senate
Christie, who is widely considered to be mulling a 2016 presidential bid, hasn't broken through in Iowa, a state known for the large role its caucus plays in presidential elections every four years, at least according to recent polls.
In a Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll out Tuesday, just 6 percent of likely Republican Iowa caucus-goers chose Christie as their first choice for president. He came in seventh in a pack of Republicans led by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney.
Christie gets compassionate as he eyes 2016
King's pheasant hunt has been a popular stop for conservative politicians looking to boost their own profiles over the years, including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum. Unlike Christie, however, these prominent Republicans have toted shotguns.
