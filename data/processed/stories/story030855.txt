(Mashable) -- Dropbox has launched a major redesign, simplifying many file management tasks and bringing a new video and photo viewer.
The first thing you'll notice in the new Dropbox UI is the action bar which lets you sort files by name, date, size and type.
Click on a file, and the action bar will get new options -- for example, you can download, delete, rename, move or copy a file from there.
You can also perform these actions by right-clicking on a file, which makes Dropbox more similar to Microsoft's Windows Explorer than ever.
Dropbox now also has a new video and photo viewer, which lets you view these types of content on your entire screen. Photos and videos (this includes Photoshop and Illustrator files) now also have thumbnails, which makes them easier to preview.
Finally, new Dropbox supports drag-and-drop, simple multiple file selections, and keyboard shortcuts (hit "?" for a full list). Dropbox search now also instantly pulls results as you type.
According to Dropbox, this redesign is only the first step in a complete overhaul of the service, with more new stuff coming in the "next few months".
