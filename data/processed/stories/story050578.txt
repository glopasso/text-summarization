Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan faces a no-confidence vote in parliament on Thursday, a major political setback that could cost him his leadership position.
The opposition Liberal Democratic Party filed a no-confidence motion Wednesday, and needs a total of 240 votes for it to pass in parliament. It cited his handling of the March 11 earthquake, tsunami and ensuing nuclear crisis as a reason for the motion.
Opposition members need 80 votes from Kan's party, the Democratic Party of Japan. So far, at least 50 members of his party say they will vote for the no-confidence motion.
If the no-confidence vote passes, Kan would be forced to step down within 10 days.
A devastating tsunami struck Japan's Pacific coast after the massive earthquake in March, triggering the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl as the cores of reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overheated and spewed radioactive chemicals.
Kan, who was unpopular before the disaster, has come under fire as the nation battles to contain the nuclear and economic woes. Adding on to the problems, ratings agency Moody's Investors Service placed the country's local and foreign currency bond ratings on review for possible downgrade.
Political in-fighting remains a problem in Japan, which has seen six prime ministers in the past five years.
Last year, after only a few months in office, his main political opponent within his own party attempted to take control of the Democratic Party of Japan, effectively taking over the premiership. Kan managed to hold onto the title of party leader.
Kan's one-year anniversary in office is June 8.
