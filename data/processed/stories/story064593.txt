(EW.com) -- Jennifer Lopez has inked a deal to join "American Idol's" judging panel for its upcoming 10th season, an industry source tells People.
The news dropped just hours after Ellen DeGeneres confirmed her exit from the show, despite having only served one year of a reported multi-season deal.
Lopez served as an "Idol" mentor on Latin night during the show's sixth season, garnering generally positive reviews for her warm, candid style, and her ability to extract a not entirely terrible performance of "Bésame Mucho" from widely maligned contestant Sanjaya Malakar.
A Fox spokesperson declined to comment on the reported deal with Lopez. Calls and emails to Fremantle Media, "American Idol" spokespersons, and Lopez's reps were not immediately returned.
