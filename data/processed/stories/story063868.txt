Thai police have arrested and detained another Iranian suspect in connection with a series of bombs that went off in Bangkok this month, a law enforcement official said.
Madani Seyed Mehrded, 33, was taken at a rental house, where authorities also confiscated a computer and a mobile phone, said the official, who was not authorized to talk to the media.
The Bangkok blasts did not kill anyone. Their intended targets are not clear, although authorities have said they were intended for Israeli diplomats.
They went off a day after a device attached to an Israeli Embassy van in New Delhi, India, exploded, wounding several people. Another device, found on an embassy car in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, was safety detonated.
The Thai National Security Council has drawn a tentative link between the bombs in Bangkok and those in India and Georgia, saying the materials used in the explosive devices were similar.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has blamed Tehran for the attacks. Iran has denied the accusation, saying that "Israeli agents are often the perpetrators of such terrorist acts."
Iran has also suggested that it would be willing to provide some assistance in investigating the Bangkok bombings.
Arrest warrants have been issued for five suspects, all identified as Iranians. Three of the five were already in custody.
