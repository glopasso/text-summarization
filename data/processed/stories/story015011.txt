The IRS filed a tax lien against Vanessa Williams, saying the singer-actress owes the federal government $369,249 for her 2011 earnings.
The lien was filed at the New York City register office on August 13, 2014, according to a document on that website.
The publicist for Williams did not immediately respond Wednesday to requests for comment.
Williams, 51, was the first black Miss America, but her reign soon erupted into scandal when nude photos of her appeared in Penthouse magazine.
Her career soared in the aftermath, with music, television and Broadway performances that earned her Grammy, Emmy and Tony nominations.
A mother of four children, Williams lives in New York.
