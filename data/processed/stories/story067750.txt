Britain's Queen Elizabeth II reflected on a year of personal and Olympic celebration in a Christmas message Tuesday that emphasized serving others.
"This past year has been one of great celebration for many," the 86-year-old monarch said in a videotaped message, reflecting on her Diamond Jubilee, which she called "especially memorable for me and my family."
She added: "It was humbling that so many chose to mark the anniversary of a duty which passed to me 60 years ago."

Her message also cited "a splendid summer of sport" with the London Olympic and Paralympic Games, which she called inspiring and filled with excitement and drama.
The queen noted that Christmas celebrates God sending his only son "to serve, not to be served."
"He restored love and service to the center of our lives in the person of Jesus Christ," she said. "It is my prayer this Christmas Day that his example and teaching will continue to bring people together to give the best of themselves in the service of others."
