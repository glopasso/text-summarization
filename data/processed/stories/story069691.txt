(CNNGo) -- Your choice of hotel probably shouldn't be based purely on the merits of its cocktail menu. But these places have so much more than a great selection of drinks.

Guests ride a special cable car down a dramatic cliff face to get to this brilliantly engineered bar perched just 46 feet above the Indian Ocean.
