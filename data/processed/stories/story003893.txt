Pakistan's former cricket star turned politician, Imran Khan, has returned home after hospital treatment for injuries suffered in a dramatic fall two weeks ago, he said Wednesday via Twitter.
Khan suffered spinal fractures and a head injury when he toppled from a forklift that was raising him up to a stage as he campaigned in Lahore for elections held on May 11.
"By the grace of Allah I am now home. Want to thank everyone 4 their prayers," Khan tweeted Wednesday.
Khan, who heads the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, added that he hoped to continue political meetings to "plan future strategies."
The party's information secretary, Shireen Mazari, told CNN that Khan had left the hospital Wednesday morning and was now at home with his family in Lahore.
"He is walking around on and off, however he still needs a lot of rest," she said.
Khan is wearing a back brace for support and is hopeful he will make a full recovery very soon, Mazari said.
The party said Tuesday that Khan had been able to stand unsupported and walk for the first time since the injury two weeks ago with the help of the specially fitted back brace.
X-rays showed his spine was healing well, the PTI statement said.
"He will continue to receive regular physiotherapy and is likely to need to wear the spinal support for some weeks to come," it said. "Imran will gradually increase physical activity over the next few weeks with a return to his full functional capacity expected in approximately six to eight weeks."
Victory in the elections went to Nawaz Sharif, a two-time former prime minister, and his party, the Pakistan Muslim League.
