(Rolling Stone) -- Following Nicki Minaj's no-show at the Hot 97 Summer Jam, Lauryn Hill took to Twitter to clarify her situation and "an innaccuracy."
Some reports have claimed Minaj had planned to bring out Nas and Hill during her performance, but after Minaj was told not to perform by YMCMB label chief Lil Wayne, the guests took the stage in her absence. Many assumed since Hill was apparently tapped by Minaj, filling-in was sort of a given.
"I was not scheduled to be a special guest on her set at Summer Jam, I was invited by Nas to perform with him," says Hill in the Twitter post. "I don't have details on exactly what transpired between the station and the artists, but I do support artists standing by their beliefs, and walking with integrity."
Hill also had some remarks for the music industry, saying, "We have to find a better way to commercially exploit music, while giving artists their proper respect. This cannot be done while taking their contributions for granted, or trying to control the scope of their growth and power through threats and fear tactics."
This past weekend, Hill performed at NYC's Highline Ballroom for a one-night-only show.
