NAPLES, Italy -- Udinese remained in fifth place in Italy's Serie A after suffering a 3-1 defeat away to Napoli on Saturday, with both teams having a player sent off.
Ezequiel Lavezzi inspired Napoli to victory against Udinese, netting twice and setting up the first goal.
Ezequiel Lavezzi scored twice in two minutes to end a goal drought lasting two and a half months, netting on 74 and 75 as Napoli moved up to ninth in the table.
The Argentine also provided the cross that Udinese defender Cristian Zapata put into his own net to leave the visitors playing catch-up from just the third minute.
Pepe leveled the score on nine minutes, and then Napoli played with 10 men from the 36th minute after Paolo Cannavaro was expelled for a last-man foul.
But the teams were even in numbers again after Pepe was ejected for a second yellow card on 60 minutes.
Udinese are still four points behind fourth-placed Fiorentina and the last Champions League berth.
Fiorentina hosts AC Milan, which has 30 points, on Sunday.
In Saturday's other match, Fabrizio Miccoli scored the only goal to give Palermo a 1-0 victory over Livorno.
Miccoli struck in the 76th minute with a shot from just outside the area with Livorno goalkeeper Marco Amelia partially unsighted by several players.
Palermo keeper Alberto Fontana saved a penalty by Francesco Tavano at the end of the first half, and had to make several vital stops in the first opening period.
Palermo had lost their last three Serie A matches and dropped down the table, but the win put them one point above Napoli in eighth.
