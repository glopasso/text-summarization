(CNN Student News) -- November 25, 2014
On our last show before the Thanksgiving break, we have a lot of big stories to cover: The U.S. defense secretary has resigned, a grand jury has reached a verdict in a tense Missouri town, and a nuclear deal involving Iran has been postponed. We're also defining earthquake swarms, and we're giving tips for how you can stay safe online. Teachers, please note that our daily program will return on Monday, December 1.
On this page you will find today's show Transcript and a place for you to request to be on the CNN Student News Roll Call.
