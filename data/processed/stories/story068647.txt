The Transportation Security Administration on Thursday extended through at least the weekend heightened security measures in the aftermath of a failed attempt to blow up a U.S. jetliner, the agency said.
"Out of an abundance of caution, the [TSA] is extending the current security measures through the busy holiday weekend," the agency said in a statement. "TSA will review and update these measures to keep the traveling public safe."
The current security directive requires airlines to physically pat down all passengers boarding planes bound for the United States and inspect their carry-on bags.
It also gives airlines the discretion to take other measures to prevent people from secretly assembling or igniting bombs on aircraft.
Those measures include prohibiting people from keeping pillows or blankets on their laps during the final hour of a flight.
The added security measures were implemented after Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, 23, allegedly tried to set off a bomb aboard a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit, Michigan, on December 25.
