Remember the look on Mike Rowe's face on CNN's "Somebody's Gotta Do It" when he was presented with the world's largest human colon?
Ew, yes -- but like a train wreck -- it was hard not to watch.
And how about that episode when Rowe made a "hair flower" at the "world's only" human hair museum?
What about when he busted a few moves with a marching band?
Mike connected with his fans in a Reddit "Ask Me Anything" online chat, saying, "Why the Mob has such a rich history in garbage-related industries and rendering-related industries is a conversation beyond my pay grade." During a CNN Facebook Q&A, he talked about his past, saying, "I crashed an audition for the Baltimore Opera. I got in. Then I got hired to sell stuff on QVC in the middle of the night. One thing (led) to another, and I eventually worked my (way) up to the sewer."
If you missed these and other priceless moments, here's where you can catch up.
