(EW.com) -- During an appearance Wednesday morning on "LIVE with Kelly and Michael," Jon Hamm announced that he will be hosting the 2013 ESPYS.
"The ESPYS is designed to showcase the year's best sports moments in a sharp, fun and entertaining manner, and Jon's the perfect host for this year's show. His appearances on shows like '30 Rock' and 'SNL' show that humor and creativity are two of his main strengths," ESPYS executive producer Maura Mandt said in a statement. "The combination of Jon's dry wit with his passion for sports will give fans a unique and original view of the year in sports."

The 2013 ESPYS will air live on ESPN on July 17 at 9 p.m. ET from Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles. Previous hosts for the show have included Justin Timberlake, Seth Meyers and Samuel L. Jackson.
Ever-ready with the jokes, Hamm said of his hosting gig, "I'm very excited to be hosting the ESPYS. As a longtime sports fan and a marginally successful high school athlete, I feel my skill-set jibes well with a host's duties. I now have to figure out what cleats to wear with a tuxedo."
