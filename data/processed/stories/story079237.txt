Los Angeles police are investigating a sexual assault claim against Bill Cosby, a police spokeswoman said Friday.
The woman is a "possible victim" of sexual assault by Bill Cosby, Officer Jane Kim said, adding it is an open case but declining further comment.
Cosby is coming under increasing scrutiny as more and more women accuse him of sexual misconduct. At least 21 women have made claims against him in recent weeks.
The 77-year-old comedian and actor has vehemently denied most of the accusations that he drugged and sexually assaulted young women. He has never been charged with a crime.
One of the latest accusations comes from former Playboy bunny P.J. Masten, who says there are 12 more ex-bunnies with similar stories who don't want to come forward.
Masten told CNN's Alisyn Camerota that Cosby drugged and raped her at a Chicago hotel. She said she told her supervisor soon afterward and was told no one would believe her because Cosby and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner were good friends.
Hefner responded to the allegations in a statement Friday, saying "Bill Cosby has been a good friend for many years and the mere thought of these allegations is truly saddening. I would never tolerate this kind of behavior, regardless of who was involved."
The new accusations could further sully the reputation of Cosby -- the man behind children's programming such as "Fat Albert" and "Little Bill," and whose eponymous No. 1 sitcom, "The Cosby Show," cast him as a wisecracking, doting family man.
