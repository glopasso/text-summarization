(CNN)Everyone's favorite nonagenarian, Betty White, got the surprise of a lifetime for her 93rd birthday -- a hula-dancing flash mob!
The actress, who played the lovably clueless Rose on "The Golden Girls," responded with glee Friday when folks on the set of her sitcom, "Hot in Cleveland," greeted her with a choreographed dance number and a banner reading "Happy Birthday Betty."
The surprise was caught on video: White is being driven in a golf cart on the "Hot in Cleveland" set by co-star Dave Foley, who casually says, "I think there might be a little bit of a celebration for your birthday."
The pair is greeted by a woman in Hawaiian regalia performing a hula-style dance. Suddenly she's joined by dozens of others wearing Hawaiian shirts, grass skirts and leis -- dancing in unison to a techno song.
White's assistant greets her daily with a little hula dance, according to People Magazine.
The flash mob culminates in a "Happy Birthday, Betty!" salutation from the crowd.
After some hugs and kisses, a stunned and smiling Betty responds: "At 93, you shouldn't be doing this!"
