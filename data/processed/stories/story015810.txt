(CNN)  -- An altercation between a South Carolina high school student and a school resource officer ended tragically Friday with the student dead of a gunshot wound and the officer hospitalized after being stabbed.
Police officers in body armor vests are on the scene after violence at a school near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.
The incident took place about 8:25 a.m., and both the officer and the 16-year-old student were transported to Conway Medical Center, where the student died, said Sgt. Robert Kegler of the Horry County Police Department.
The resource officer, who was a Horry County police officer assigned to the school, remains hospitalized, he said.
Kegler had no other information.
"Anytime anything happens with a police officer like this, we ask an outside agency to come in to investigate," he said. "In this case, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is taking the lead."
Teal Britton, a spokeswoman for Horry County Schools, said the student had asked to see the officer at Carolina Forest High School in Myrtle Beach.
"They went into his office, and the door was shut, and then the struggle began," she said. School officials have "no clue in terms of what might have brought that about."
Britton also had no further information and said the Law Enforcement Division had asked that the high school refrain from discussing details.
Neither Britton nor Kegler named the officer or the student.
The state agency has not responded to requests for comment.
Myrtle Beach is a popular vacation destination in northeast South Carolina, on the Atlantic coast.
