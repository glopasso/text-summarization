Amanda Bynes has nothing to hide.
The actress has returned to Twitter after a rough 2013, and confirmed that she's posting all social media messages from @amandabynes, not through pseudonyms as some have speculated.
"FYI This is my only twitter account, I have no secret twitter accounts. Xoxo Amanda," Bynes posted along with a sketch that appears to be of herself.
The 27-year-old's Twitter account was once the place where headlines were made, as she would post questionable and at times disturbing messages occasionally involving other celebrities. But since her release from an in-patient treatment facility in December, where she spent four months under involuntary psychiatric hold, Bynes has cleaned house.
All of the old tweets have been banished, and in their place are brief, run-of-the-mill updates along with a smattering of older photos.
"Hi everyone! I'm busy studying at (the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising) but I want to say I love you to my fans!" she shared on March 1.
It's a marked change in tone and topic since March 2013, when she became infamous for sending Drake a lewd tweet. That July, after accumulating various run-ins with the law, Bynes was initially detained for a mental health evaluation when she was involved in a residential disturbance. That detainment turned into a psychiatric hold that lasted until December, when she was released into her parents' custody.
Bynes' mother's lawyer, Tamar Arminak, said at the time that Bynes was continuing treatment as an outpatient several times a week, and was "excited to be home ... and especially happy to re-establish a loving relationship with her parents."
