This week we're going beyond the continent's borders to explore the African Diaspora.
Forced to flee Somalia, refugees are rebuilding communities in the United States.
We visit America's largest Somali neighborhood, in the state of Minnesota, and take a look at the medical community's attention to Somali health.
We also look at how a Somali chef is on a mission to share the flavor and fusion of East African cuisine with the people of Minnesota.   Rebuilding Communities
In Somalia, an ongoing civil war has caused instability throughout the country and displaced countless people. Now, tens of thousands of those refugees live in Minnesota. The team go into the local East African neighborhood and find out how Somalis are adjusting to their new home.
Somali Health Care
We look at how Minnesota's Somali community is benefiting from access to local healthcare.
Safari Express
One Somali emigrant, 28-year-old Jamal Hashi, is enjoying the sweet smell of success. He's the owner of Safari Express -- a fast-food take on African food. He tells us about his mission to share his country's cuisine.
