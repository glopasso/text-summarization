Veteran Spanish full-back Michel Salgado has joined English Premier League side Blackburn Rovers on a two-year deal.
Salgado won two Champions League and four Primera Liga titles during his 10 years at Real Madrid.
Salgado, who has been capped 53 times by his country, had his Real Madrid contract cancelled by mutual consent earlier this month.
During his time at the Bernabeu, the 33-year-old helped the club to two Champions League triumphs and four Primera Liga titles.
Blackburn are now waiting for international clearance before Salgado can make his debut.
He is heading back to Madrid next week to say goodbye at a match arranged in his honor against Rosenborg on Monday.
Salgado said he is relishing the challenge that lies ahead after revealing he almost moved to England five years ago.
Talking to the official Blackburn Web site, Salgado said: "I had a chance to come to Chelsea but I was lucky too because my team was Real Madrid.
"I love the club, I was there 10 years -- it is a lifetime. I am proud of playing for them for so long.
"Now I want to enjoy the next two years, playing in the Premier League. It is one of the best in the world, with fantastic games and a fantastic atmosphere," he added.
"This will be a good experience for me, my wife and children. I have joined an historic club."
