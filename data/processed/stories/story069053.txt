Burt Reynolds checked into a drug rehab clinic "to regain control of his life" after becoming addicting to painkillers prescribed following back surgery, his manager said.
Reynolds won Golden Globe for his role as a porn producer in the 1997 hit movie "Boogie Nights."
A short statement, issued by manager Erik Kritzer on Wednesday, did not say when or where Reynolds entered rehab.
"After a recent back surgery, Mr. Reynolds felt like he was going through hell and after a while, realized he was a prisoner of prescription pain pills," Kritzer said. "He checked himself into rehab in order to regain control of his life.
"Mr. Reynolds hopes his story will help others in a similar situation," Kritzer said.
"He hopes they will not try to solve the problem by themselves, but realize that sometimes it is too tough to do on their own and they should seek help, as he did."
Reynolds was an Academy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner for his role as a porn producer in the 1997 hit movie "Boogie Nights."
His film career, which started in 1961, also included starring roles in the classic movies "Deliverance," "Smokey and the Bandit" and "Cannonball Run."
