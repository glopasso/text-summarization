(CNNMoney) -- Here's one way to make your iPhone hacker-proof: Ask hackers for advice.
I recently caught up with security researchers at the online security conference Infiltrate. At dinner one evening, I placed my iPhone on the table. I was surrounded by ethical hackers whose jobs are to find vulnerabilities before the bad guys and exploit security flaws.
"I could hack your phone pretty easily," security researcher Tomi Tuominen mentioned. Obviously, I took notice.
For the next 20 minutes, Tuominen and information security researcher Robert Lee gave me a tutorial on making my iPhone settings hacker-proof. Some of them are basic -- like changing your four character password to something more complex. Others take a bit more work, such as using settings to limit ad tracking.
