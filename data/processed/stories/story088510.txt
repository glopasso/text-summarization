At least three people were killed and scores injured in a blast in downtown Mombasa on Saturday, the Kenyan Interior Ministry said.
The explosion was caused by a grenade that was hurled at a crowd, the ministry said via Twitter.
Eleven of the injured were taken to Coast General Hospital, according to the ministry.
A second explosion was reported near the tourist area of Nyali Beach, also in Mombasa, the ministry said.
Several people at the Reef Hotel were injured in the Nyali Beach explosion, CNN affiliate KTN reported.
The Interior Ministry, however, said there were no casualties in the second explosion. An improvised explosive device was discovered at the Reef Hotel gate when a bag was noticed and people took cover, the ministry said.
The Nyali area is home to resorts and hotels along the coast.
