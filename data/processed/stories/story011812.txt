There is less of Roseanne Barr to love these days.
Barr showed off her new svelte figure Tuesday at the NBCUniversal Summer Press Day. The comedic actress was there as part of her new gig as a judge on the network's show "Last Comic Standing."
Fans praised Barr for her new look and she responded by tweeting "hey, THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH FOR ALL OF THE NICE WORDS ABOUT MY WEIGHT LOSS! I'm inspired 2 keep going!"
Barr's trim reveal comes weeks after her ex-husband, Tom Arnold, showed off his 90-pound weight loss. No competition we are sure as the pair have more than made up after a Twitter squabble a few months ago.
Barr was most recently in the news after the parents of George Zimmerman announced they were suing her for allegedly tweeting their home address.
