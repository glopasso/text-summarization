"Love 99, Happiness forever" was the theme as 163 couples married in Taiwan's capital on Thursday.
Thursday was the ninth day of the ninth month of the 99th year since the founding of Taiwan. Also, the number nine is auspicious in Chinese, because it sounds like the word "longevity."
The mass wedding ceremony was held at 8 a.m. at a pavilion of the Taipei International Flora Exposition.
Taipei's Mayor Hau Lung-bin served as the chief witness, and sent out his blessing at 9:09 a.m.The couples also received blessings from area temples, where bells were rung to celebrate the event.
Among the couples married, according to the Taipei mayor's civil affairs department: one couple who have been in love for 16 years; one couple who've had a three-year long-distance relationship; and people with birthdays on September 9.
