A California doctor has been accused of negligence in the case of a woman who gave birth to octuplets in January 2009, according to a complaint filed by the state medical board.
Michael Kamrava, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Beverly Hills, is accused of gross negligence and repeated negligent acts in the treatment of a patient named in the complaint only by her initials, N.S.
Octuplet mom Nadya Suleman has identified Kamrava as her doctor in interviews. Suleman has six children in addition to the octuplets -- all conceived through in-vitro fertilization.
In filing the complaint in December, the medical board's executive director, Barbara Johnston, says Kamrava, while his patient was undergoing in-vitro, transferred a number of embryos that was "far in excess of [American Society for Reproductive Medicine] recommendations and beyond the reasonable judgment of any treating physician."
The society recommends no more than two embryos for women under 35 years old and no more than five for women over 40, for whom it is harder to get pregnant, according to guidelines published on its Web site. Suleman was 33 when she gave birth to the octuplets. The reproductive society expelled Kamrava from the group in September.
Additionally, the complaint says Kamrava should have referred his patient to a mental health physician after she repeatedly returned to him for additional in-vitro treatments shortly after each of her pregnancies.
"[Kamrava] failed to exercise appropriate judgment and question whether there would be harm to her living children and any future offspring should she continue to conceive," the complaint says.
Efforts to reach Kamrava on Monday were unsuccessful.
No hearing date has been set in the case.
