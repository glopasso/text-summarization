Fans of the HBO hit series "The Wire" have two ways to revisit the streets of Baltimore this week.
Coinciding with a five-day marathon of the complete series remastered in high definition, Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton is visiting locations from David Simon's critically acclaimed drama.
Wondering what the fictional neighborhood of Hamsterdam looks like in real life? How has Marlo's spot withstood the test of time? Time permitting, Fenton has been taking fan requests to visit locations on his lunch break, take pictures of them and share them on Twitter.
Here are a few of the spots Fenton has hit so far.
At least one fan joined in the fun by sharing past and present images of the bar where Frank and Nick Sobotka spent time with fellow longshoremen. "Good but points deducted for Zillow," Fenton said.
