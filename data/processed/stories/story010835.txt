(CNN Student News) -- October 20, 2014
What are the risks, and what's the potential payoff? These are questions you'll find throughout today's show. We explain the tremendous risks that venture capitalists take and how those risks may or may not pay off. We explore why some countries might withdraw their bids to host the Olympic Games. And we feature a Character Study on a cross-country runner who risked a higher placement to help a rival.
