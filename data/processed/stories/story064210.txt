A 20-year-old Florida woman was in critical condition Friday after she shot and killed her 6-month-old son and then turned the gun on herself, police said.
Authorities found Melanie Reyes and her baby after performing a welfare check at the request of Reyes' family, who called 911 to report a statement on her Facebook page in which she "indicated she was going to shoot her child and herself," according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office.
Both were transported to a hospital, where the infant was pronounced dead.
Police recovered the handgun believed used in the shootings from the home.
The incident comes roughly two weeks after Reyes was arrested for aggravated domestic battery after her boyfriend said she struck him with a baseball bat, according to a police report. Her next court date had been scheduled for January 22.
