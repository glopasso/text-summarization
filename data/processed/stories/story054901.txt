Jessica Simpson is a married woman -- again.
The star married her beau, retired NFL player Eric Johnson, on Saturday in Santa Barbara, California. The couple, who began dating in 2010, are the parents of 2-year-old daughter Maxwell and 1-year-old son Ace.
According to People, which snagged an exclusive portrait of Simpson in her custom Carolina Herrera wedding gown and veil, the event proved to be "the happiest moment of our lives," according to Simpson.
"The whole weekend was magical for us," she told People. "We feel complete."
E! reported that according to a source, the groom got choked up while reciting his vows, while the bride had to start her vows over after inserting her name for his.
Simpson was previously married to singer Nick Lachey, with whom she starred in the very successful MTV reality series "Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica." The pair split in 2005 and Lachey later married actress and former MTV personality Vanessa Minnillo in 2011.
