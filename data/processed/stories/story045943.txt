Anna Gordy Gaye, the sister of Motown's founder and ex-wife of late legendary singer Marvin Gaye, has died.
She was 92.
She died early Friday surrounded by relatives, her family said in a statement.
Her 14-year marriage to Gaye ended in divorce, but not before she inspired some of his songs, including "Pride and Joy" and "You're a Wonderful One."
The couple divorced in 1977 but remained friends until his death seven years later, the family said. He was shot by his father with a gun he'd given him for safety.
She is survived by a son, Marvin Gaye III, and two brothers, including Berry Gordy, who founded the Motown record label.
