The teenage niece of golf superstar Tiger Woods has failed to make the cut in her first professional tournament.
Cheyenne Woods was handed entry into the Wegmans tournament on a sponsor's invite.
Cheyenne Woods was four strokes shy of qualifying for the weekend rounds of the LPGA Tour's Wegmans event at Locust Hill in Rochester, New York.
The 18-year-old had to complete her second round on Saturday along with half of the 140-player field due to delays of almost five hours following thunderstorms in the area.
Competing on a sponsor's invite, the college amateur followed up her opening 75 with a two-over-par 74 to be well down the field.
She had been two-under for the round after 10 holes on Friday, but fell back again with a triple-bogey at the par-four 12th before finishing strongly with a birdie.
Cheyenne is the daughter of world No. 1 Tiger's half-brother, Earl Jnr.
Defending champion Eun-Hee Ji also missed the cut after completing a 71 which saw her seven over the card.
South Korean Shin Jiyai had led by three strokes overnight after posting a 68 which gave her a 36-hole total of  11-under-par 133.
However, Morgan Pressel reduced that advantage to just a single stroke when she picked up two birdies to complete a 66, leaving her one shot ahead of third-placed fellow American Stacy Lewis.
