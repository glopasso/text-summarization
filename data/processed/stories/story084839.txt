(Rolling Stone) -- Iggy Pop has announced a new album of mostly French covers set for May 9.
"Après" will feature the singer's versions of songs by Serge Gainsbourg, Edith Piaf, the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, Yoko Ono and more.
"I wanted to sing some of these songs myself, hoping to bring the feeling I felt as a listener to my listeners through my voice," said Iggy Pop in a press release. "Many of these songs are in French, probably because it is French culture which has most stubbornly resisted the mortal attacks of the Anglo-American music machine."
"Après" follows Iggy Pop's 2009 English/French album "Préliminaires," which was inspired by the Michel Houellebecq novel "La Possibilité d'une Ile" ("The Possibility of an Island").
Track listing:
"Et Si Tu N'Existais Pas" (Joe Dassin)
"La Javanaise" (Serge Gainsbourg)
"Everybody's Talkin'" (Harry Nilsson)
"I'm Going Away Smiling" (Yoko Ono)
"La Vie En Rose" (Edith Piaf)
"Les Passantes" (Georges Brassens)
"Syracuse" (Henri Salvador)
"What Is This Thing Called Love?" (Cole Porter)
"Michelle" (The Beatles)
"Only the Lonely" (Frank Sinatra)
