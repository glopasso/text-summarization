(EW.com) -- Some day, someone will figure out how to parlay's Jeff Probst's talent for talk into something that doesn't involve a deserted island: CBS Television Distribution today decided to not go forward with a second season of his daytime talk show.
"We believe Jeff is an incredible talent, and that he and his dedicated producing team delivered quality episodes throughout the season," according to a studio statement. "Unfortunately, the audience isn't there to support a second year. We are grateful to the entire staff, our affiliate partners and advertisers for their ongoing support of The Jeff Probst Show. Production and broadcast of original episodes will continue through the current season."

Added Probst in a statement: "I'm super bummed but extremely proud. The truth is all shows come to an end. Ours just ended a decade sooner than we had hoped."

The news comes a week after Twentieth Television decided to pull the plug on Ricki Lake's freshman talk show, which also failed to garner enough ratings for a second season. One other new talk show will see another year: Katie Couric's show has been renewed.
