Lance Armstrong's Radio Shack team has been involved in a doping case after Chinese rider Fuyu Li tested positive for the banned substance Clenbuterol.
In a statement confirming the news, Radio Shack said: "We have been informed by the UCI that our rider Fuyu Li has had an A-sample positive test for the banned substance Clenbuterol.
"The sample was collected on March 23 in Belgium and Fuyu Li has been immediately suspended pending the outcome of his B-sample test in the next few weeks.
"If that test is positive the rider will be removed from the team.
"Team RadioShack and its management take this incident very seriously. We will respect the rights of our rider but will enforce our zero tolerance policy should his B-sample test positive."
Fuyu, the first Chinese to take out a professional cycling licence, is the second rider to have failed a drugs test in as many days after Italy's Mattia Gavazzi of the CSF team tested positive for cocaine following a test in March.
