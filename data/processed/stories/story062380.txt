The GOP's efforts to portray independent Kansas Senate hopeful Greg Orman as a Democrat in disguise haven't yet knocked him out of contention, a new poll shows.
Orman and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts are tied at 46% each, according to the Monmouth University survey of 429 likely voters. The survey, which was conducted October 16-19, has a margin of error of plus-or-minus 4.7 percentage points.
The results suggest Orman -- who had surged into the lead a month ago after the Democratic candidate dropped out -- has remained competitive despite an onslaught of attacks from Republicans whose hopes of winning Senate control could depend on their ability to keep the seat in deep-red Kansas.
Roberts still has work to do winning over conservatives, the poll shows. Just 76% of Republicans said they plan to vote for Roberts, and 8% were undecided.
It also shows that a big chunk of the electorate -- 30%-- says it makes "no difference" whether Republicans or Democrats control the Senate.
The survey is the latest of several in recent weeks to show a right race. A CNN/ORC poll earlier this month found Roberts leading, 49% to Orman's 48%.
The Monmouth poll also found Republican Gov. Sam Brownback in deep trouble. He trailed Democratic challenger Paul Davis, who earned 50% of likely voters' support to Brownback's 45%.
"The Kansas polls have been volatile ever since the Democratic nominee withdrew from the Senate race. There may be enough ticket splitting to give the Republicans a win in one contest but not the other," said Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute in West Long Branch, New Jersey.
