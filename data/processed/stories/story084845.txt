At least 361 people have died and 600,000 were living in refugee camps because of flooding in Pakistan, the country's national disaster authority said Tuesday.
The flooding in Sindh and Balochistan provinces has destroyed 1.5 million homes in 41,000 villages, the government said.
The United Nations World Food Program has been distributing food, starting in the hard-hit city of Badin. As of Friday, more than 15,000 people have received assistance, the agency said.
The agency estimated that 73% of food crops in the flood zone and 36% of livestock were lost or destroyed.
The United Nations said Monday that it is seeking donors to build a $357 million fund to help the Pakistani government's flood response efforts.
It is meant to provide food, water, sanitation, health care and shelter for some flood victims for up to six months.
"More than five million people are struggling to survive massive flooding across southern Pakistan, and the rains continue to fall," said Valerie Amos, the U.N. under-secretary-general for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
Last year, Pakistan was also the site of massive and deadly flooding.
In August 2010, weeks of flooding caused $9.7 billion in damages to homes, roads and farms in southwest Pakistan.
More than 1,700 people died in the 2010 flooding, and more than 20 million were displaced.
