A man serving 74 life sentences for kidnapping two Missouri boys and holding one of them for more than four years was assaulted by another inmate, officials said Wednesday.
Michael Devlin, 45, received superficial puncture wounds from a homemade weapon, said Chris Cline, spokesman for the Missouri Department of Corrections. Cline said he could not identify the other inmate, a motive or other matters related to an investigation of the April 9 incident.
Devlin is being held in "administrative segregation" from other inmates at Crossroads Correctional Center in Cameron, Cline told CNN. He was taken to a hospital and was returned to the maximum-security prison, Cline said.
The parents of one boy, whom Devlin is accused of abducting in 2002, told Oprah Winfrey in a show that aired in 2007 that they suspected their son was sexually assaulted by Devlin.
Prosecutors alleged that Devlin produced Polaroid photographs and videos of the youth, then 11, and took him to Illinois and Arizona.
The two boys were discovered in January 2007. The second victim, 13 at the time, was abducted a few days before Devlin's arrest.
Devlin, a former pizzeria manager, has two reported conduct violations since his 2007 incarceration, according to Cline, who would not describe them.
The inmate's 79 convictions include attempted murder, forcible sodomy, attempted forcible sodomy, armed criminal actions and kidnapping.
