Sharon Stone's former maid filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against the actress on Monday, contending Stone fired her because she was injured carrying groceries.
Angelica Castillo's complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, comes less than a year after Stone's former nanny sued accusing her of violating labor laws and and making derogatory comments about her ethnicity.
The suit says Castillo suffered severe pain when she hurt her back while carrying Stone's groceries in June. Although a doctor ordered her not to lift heavy objects and to get bed rest, Stone told her to return to work, the complaint said.
"Plaintiff was required to perform her regular duties, including but not limited to grocery shopping, lifting and moving heavy items as part of cleaning the residences," the complaint said.
"While the plaintiff was still in severe pain, Stone repeatedly yelled at plaintiff for performing her duties more slowly, and called her 'crazy' and 'stupid,' " the suit said.
Stone fired her the same day, the lawsuit said.
The complaint accuses Stone of wrongful termination and failure to provide accommodation for her injury.
The lawyer for the actress did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.
The former nanny's lawsuit, filed in May, said she was fired because she refused to return overtime pay that Stone told her she did not deserve. Stone told her she learned from her accountant in January 2011 that she was paying the nanny overtime when she worked holidays or traveled to care for her three children, the suit said.
Erlinda Elemen, a Filipino, worked as a live-in nanny for the actress for more than four years until she was fired in February 2011, the lawsuit said.
Stone called it "an absurd lawsuit" with "made-up and fabricated" claims, filed by "a disgruntled ex-employee who is obviously looking to get money any way she can."
