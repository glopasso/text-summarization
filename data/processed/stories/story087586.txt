Fugitive Italian mobster Antonio Iovine has been arrested in the country's south, Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said Thursday.
Iovine, 46, was on the ministry's list of the country's 30 most-dangerous fugitives and was apprehended in a Naples Police operation.
"It is a beautiful day for the fight against the mafia," Maroni said. "The capture of the boss constitutes a fundamental threshold in the context of the biggest contrasting operation started against the Camorra clans that operate in Campania."
A Naples court in 2008 sentenced him to life in prison for his mafia activities.
While a fugitive for more than 14 years, Iovine is believed to have managed the Camorra clan's financial affairs as its "boss manager."
