The Miami Heat's "Big Three" rode to the rescue as the 2012 NBA champions leveled the 2013 series at 2-2 with a 109-93 away win against the San Antonio Spurs in Game Four.
LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh scored 85 of Miami's points, having struggled to impose themselves on the three previous games.
"It was on our shoulders," James told reporters after finishing with 33 points and 11 rebounds, the first time he has passed the 20-point mark in this year's finals.
"We had to figure out how to win the game for us and play at the highest level. When all three of us are clicking we're very tough to beat."
Wade scored 32 points with Bosh scoring 20 and 11 rebounds, while the Spurs conceded 19 turnovers which led to 23 points.
"When Bosh, Wade and James score the way they did tonight and shoot it the way they did tonight, a team is going to have a difficult time if you help them like we did," said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich.
"When those guys are playing like that, you better be playing a perfect game."
San Antonio's star man Tony Parker recovered from a hamstring injury to play on Thursday, finishing the game with 15 points and nine assists.
It was a far cry from the dominant Spurs display during Tuesday's 113-77 win in Game Three.
"They play very aggressive defense," said the Frenchman. "They gamble and they take a lot of chances, and tonight it worked."
Wade bettered his previous high score in this postseason by 11 points.
"It was all about myself, Chris and LeBron coming out and leading this team to a victory," he said.
"The thing we talked about is we all have to make an impact in this game, somehow, some way."
Sunday's Game Five will be the last at San Antonio's AT & T Center, with the series returning to Miami for Game Six on Tuesday.
