At least one person has died and 14 are injured after part of the roof collapsed at a soccer stadium in the Netherlands Thursday, local officials have said.
Sniffer dogs are being used to search for any others who may be trapped in the wreckage, Moniek Eberhard in the mayor's office for the town of Enschede told CNN.
Those injured are thought to be construction workers. It is not known how many people were working in the area when the collapse occurred, at midday local time.
Two people were seriously injured and have been taken to hospital, while three were treated at the scene, Eberhard said.
The club has grown over recent seasons, and was working to expand the seating at its stadium.
Building work was being carried out on the roof above the stands at the FC Twente soccer club's De Grolsch Veste stadium.
Speaking at a televised news conference, the club's general affairs manager, Jan van Halst, urged fans not to come to the stadium to see the damage as it might hinder the work of emergency responders.
The club, founded in 1965, finished second in the top Dutch league, the Eredivisie, last season, having won it the year before. FC Twente also made its first appearance in the Champions League, a major European tournament, last season.
Enschede is to the east of the Netherlands, near the border with Germany.
