Hugh Jackman revealed Thursday that he had a cancerous growth removed from his nose.
The actor posted a picture of his bandaged nose on his Instagram account with a message to fans:
"Deb said to get the mark on my nose checked. Boy, was she right! I had a (basal) cell carcinoma. Please don't be foolish like me. Get yourself checked. And USE sunscreen!!!"

Deb is Deborra-Lee Furness, his wife of 17 years.
Jackman, 45, didn't share any other details about the procedure.
