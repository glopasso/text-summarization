The U.S. State Department has issued a warning to American citizens traveling or residing in Uganda to maintain a high level of vigilance as a major African Union summit gets underway Monday.
The security warning comes a week after a trio of bombings killed 74 people in Uganda's capital, Kampala, during the World Cup final. Many of those killed and injured had gathered to watch the match. A Somali Islamist militant movement claimed responsibility for the July 11 bombings at two venues.
"All U.S. citizens should consider the possibility of similar terrorist attacks occurring in conjunction with the African Union Summit," officials said in a statement released Friday.
The summit, which will focus heavily on maternal and child health, began Sunday and continues through July 27, according to the African Union website.
Officials are encouraging Americans to take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness in large public gatherings, which they say can be vulnerable targets for extremist or terrorist groups.
The travel alert expires August 15.
