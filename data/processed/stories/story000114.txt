Bomb blasts in Pakistan rocked three police buildings near Lahore, police told CNN on Wednesday.
Police chief Ghulam Mehmood Dogar said the three bombs were planted on Tuesday night at a police station, an office of a senior police official and a police barracks.
They were detonated by remote control this morning in the city of Gujranwala, 70 kilometers northwest of Lahore, Dogar said.
Three police officers were injured and parts of the buildings were damaged.
The first two explosions happened within 30 minutes of one another, and the third bomb was detonated about three hours later.
Gujranwala has been largely free of the militant violence plaguing parts of Pakistan.
Police said there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attacks.
On Monday, two people were injured when in back to back explosions at police stations in the southern port city of Karachi.
