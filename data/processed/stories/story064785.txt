(EW.com) -- NBC's "Celebrity Apprentice" live final couldn't withstand ABC's telecast of the Billboard Music Awards.
The three-hour music awards telecast delivered 7.4 million viewers and a 2.7 rating among adults 18-49. That's tying with Billboard's lowest-rated telecast ever and down 10 percent this year. Still, it was enough to win the night for ABC.
The two-hour "Celebrity Apprentice" (6.8 million, 2.2) closer was the reality competition's lowest-rated finale ever, down a sharp 27 percent from last year (here's Dalton Ross' interview with the winner). Fox's animation lineup also had its finales, including "The Simpsons" (4.8 million, 2.1) and a one-hour "Family Guy" (5.3 million, 2.5).
