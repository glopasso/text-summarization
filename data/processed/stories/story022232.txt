Birdies are one thing but baboons on the golf course are not quite so welcome.
Luke Donald had to dodge a baboon that cut across play at the Nedbank Golf Challenge in Sun City, South Africa.
The former world No. 1 jumped out of the way as the large primate bounded between the bunkers during the second round.
Donald tweeted afterwards: "Couple of things happened to me that haven't happened in a while....one I shot 63, and two I let a baboon play through on the course.
"The fact that my caddy Johnnie didn't even flinch makes my reaction look even more pathetic!!"
At least the Englishman can say he was not put off his stroke by the monkey business.
Donald holds a one-shot lead over countryman Danny Willett going into the final round.
It is not the first time that baboons have made an appearance at the Sun City event and animals on the golf course are nothing new in the global game.
A three-legged alligator at last year's Zurich Classic in New Orleans gave a new meaning to the golfing term water hazard.
A herd of hopping kangaroos at the 2013 Ladies' Australian Open in Canberra provided an interesting wildlife distraction for spectators.
Swiss golfers had to contend with a golf ball eating fox, whose antics made worldwide news.
