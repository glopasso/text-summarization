"The Big Lebowski," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and "Saving Private Ryan" have long been national treasures, but the Library of Congress just made it official.
Every year, the library's National Film Registry selects 25 movies to be added to its roster with the intent of preserving them for "all time." The idea is to collect the projects that best represent "the extraordinary diversity of America's film heritage" and are "culturally, historically or aesthetically significant."
This year's additions range from those aforementioned comedies to Pixar's first short, "Luxo Jr.," to the classic horror flick "Rosemary's Baby." Interestingly enough, given John Hughes' prolific career and how many seminal projects he had a hand in, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" is the first Hughes film to be added to the registry.
These 25 films bring the total number of movies in the National Film Registry to 650. Check out the gallery above to see 21 of this year's inductees.
