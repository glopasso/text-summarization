Maria Sharapova boosted her hopes of winning a first French Open title next month by beating last year's runner-up Samantha Stosur in the final of the Rome Masters on Sunday.
The Russian, who counts clay as her least favorite surface, triumphed 6-2 6-4 in just 83 minutes in a match delayed by rain.
It was the former world No. 1's first title since winning a minor event in Strasbourg a year ago, and her first in a top-level clay tournament. She had lost her previous four WTA Tour finals.
Sharapova, seeded seventh, followed up her semifinal win over current top-ranked woman Caroline Wozniacki as she beat the Australian for the eighth consecutive time in their first encounter on the red dirt.
"I'm so happy to be the champion. It means so much to me to add this title to the ones I already have," she told the crowd after collecting her 23rd career crown.
"Rome is such a special place and I've dreamed of holding up this trophy. There are a lot of tournaments coming up, and this is a great start to everything. I can't wait to be back next year."
The 24-year-old has won three of the four grand slams, but this year could be her best chance to succeed at Roland Garros with the Williams sisters Serena and Venus not playing, Justine Henin retired and Kim Clijsters recovering from injury.
Stosur will again be one of the contenders, having reached her first final since losing to Francesca Schiavone in Paris nearly 12 months ago.
Seeded sixth in Rome, she beat the Italian before eliminating China's Australian Open runner-up Li Na in the semifinals on Saturday.
However, Stosur made a poor start against Sharapova as she won only one of the first 15 points and quickly found herself 4-0 down.
She had a double break-point at 5-4 down in the second set on Sharapova's serve but hit the net, then returned long before her opponent won it with a forehand.
