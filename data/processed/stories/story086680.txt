(CNN)It seems iPads hold their value pretty well, especially if they have papal connections
One that Pope Francis once owned just sold for $30,500, according to Castells, an auction house in Uruguay.
The Apple tablet had all the personal touches.
"His Holiness Francisco" and "Vatican Internet Service, March 2013" were engraved on the back in Spanish and Italian. It also came with a keyboard and a certificate signed by the Pope's personal secretary.
The proceeds will go to a school in Montevideo, Uruguay.
It's not the first time a papal hand-me-down has gone for big bucks.
Last year, the Pope donated a Harley-Davidson that he was given to charity.
The motorcycle sold for $284,000 at auction, more than 10 times its normal sales price. A Harley motorcycle jacket signed by Francis sold for nearly $68,000.
