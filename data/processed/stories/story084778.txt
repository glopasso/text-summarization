Miley Cyrus, forget what you've heard. Suzanne Somers wants you to know she is having plenty of sex, thank you very much.
The 66-year-old former "Three's Company" star told the ladies of "The Talk" on Tuesday that she and her husband have sex "a couple times a day."
"He's on hormones; I'm on hormones," Somers said, to the delight of the show's co-hosts.
Somers' comments came after Miley Cyrus told Matt Lauer on "Today" on Monday that it was her understanding that people in their 40s aren't having sex.
"I heard when you turn 40, things start to go a little less sexual," she said. "Probably around that time, I heard that's when people don't have sex anymore."
Not according to Somers.
The actress has revealed that she and her husband of 36 years, Alan Hamel, usually start the day off well.
"There's some level at 4 in the morning, and then I'm really awake around 8 or so," she said. "We have busy mornings."
The actress and breast cancer survivor has been making the rounds promoting her new book, "I'm Too Young for This."
