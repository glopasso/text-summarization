North Korea fired two short-range missiles off the coast of the Korean Peninsula early Wednesday, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said.
North Korea did not declare a no-fly zone prior to the launch, the official said. No damage or injures were reported.
The projectiles, assumed to be short-range ballistic missiles, flew more than 310 miles (almost 500 kilometers), the official said.
The official said the missiles were launched from North Korea's western Hwanghae Province and flew northeast toward the water.
