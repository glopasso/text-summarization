A truck carrying fuel for NATO forces was set ablaze Tuesday by suspected militants in Pakistan's southwestern province of Balochistan, police said.
The truck was on its way to NATO forces in Afghanistan when unknown assailants ambushed it and set it on fire near Quetta, the provincial capital near the Pakistan-Afghan border, said police official Muhammad Khalil.
Trucks carrying fuel and supplies for NATO forces have become frequent targets of militants opposed to American presence in the region.
