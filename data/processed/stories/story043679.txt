French first lady Valerie Trierweiler has left the hospital where she had checked in for stress and fatigue after a tabloid's allegations of an affair between President Francois Hollande and an actress, Paris Match magazine reported Saturday.
The same magazine -- where Trierweiler is a longtime correspondent -- reported that she will recover for "several days" in an official residence in Versailles.
CNN affiliate BFM-TV also reported the departure from the hospital, citing unnamed sources close to the first lady.
"Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all who sent messages support and recovery via twitter, SMS or email," Trierweiler wrote from her verified Twitter account on Saturday, hours after her reported release. "Very touched."
Trierweiler has been Hollande's partner for several years.
The Elysee palace told CNN on Saturday that there was "no comment" on Trierweiler's departure.
Hollande is visiting his home district this weekend and made his first visit to see his live-in partner Friday, just over a week after she checked into the hospital.
New claims emerged Friday about the reported liaison between the President and French actress Julie Gayet, including allegations that it has been going on for two years.
In its online edition, the French magazine Closer, which first published reports of an affair a week ago, says the "couple" also made use of a second apartment near the Elysee Palace for romantic trysts and went on weekend breaks in the south of France.
The tabloid's latest allegations come a day after it said that Gayet is suing the magazine over its earlier report. Her lawyers want 50,000 euros for invasion of privacy plus 4,000 euros in legal fees, according to the magazine.
