Five people were killed when their boat struck a barge in southern Louisiana, the Terrebonne Parish sheriff said Thursday.
The accident occurred Wednesday night in the Falgout Canal in Dularge, Louisiana, Sheriff Vernon Bourgeois said.
The bodies were not discovered until Thursday morning, when people began arriving on the barge for work and saw the boat and one body, Bourgeois said. The barge is being used to repair damage to the canal from past hurricanes.
The victims' damaged boat was partially submerged under the barge, he said. The barge was slightly damaged, he said.
The victims were last seen about 10 p.m. Wednesday leaving the Dulac, Louisiana-area en route to Bayou Dularge, the sheriff's office said.
The victims were identified as: Michael J. Carrere, 43, of the Bayou Blue area, Louisiana; Carey Meche, 52, of Metairie, Louisiana; Lawrence Flak, 54, of Conroe, Texas; Rene Gauthier, 59, of Houston, Texas; and William Voss, 49, of Katy, Texas.
They were entered in a fishing tournament that begins Friday, the sheriff said.
Additional details were not immediately available.
The accident occurred about 75 miles southwest of New Orleans.
