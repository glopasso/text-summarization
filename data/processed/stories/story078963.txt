It's pretty hard to be a standout actor if you're working with a bad script, so it's no surprise that some of the year's strongest performances came from screenplays nominated for a Writer's Guild award.
The East and West branches of the Writer's Guild of America announced their nominees for outstanding achievement in writing for the screen on Friday. Among the titles are some very recognizable names, including "American Hustle" filmmaker David O. Russell, "Her" director Spike Jonze and venerated Hollywood figure Woody Allen.

If you're surprised by the names missing from this list, Entertainment Weekly notes that only union members or scripts crafted under the guidance of a guild agreement are eligible for nomination. That left "12 Years A Slave's" John Ridley and "Philomena's" Steve Coogan and Jeff Pope, three screenwriters who worked on two of this awards season's big hits, disqualified from receiving an honor.
The awards will be handed out at simultaneous ceremonies held in New York and Los Angeles on February 1. Check out the nominees in the three screen categories below:
