On the same day voters head to the polls in Kansas, independent Senate candidate Greg Orman — who's hoping to oust incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts — said Tuesday his campaign feels confident about his chances, but he again refused to say which party he would caucus with if he wins the election.
"We feel confident. Voters obviously are attracted to what we're trying to get accomplished," he said on CNN's "New Day." "They realize Washington is broken and that ultimately we're not going to solve the problems in Washington by sending the same people back there."

Frustrated critics say Orman has not been transparent about who he would vote with in Congress — a crucial unknown factor with the Senate majority hanging in the balance.
"I'm not going there to represent the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, I'm going there to represent Kansas," he said, adding that he plans to work with senators from both parties.

He gave a few examples Tuesday of where he would stand on the issues, saying he would have voted in favor of the farm bill and the Veterans Affairs reform bill.
Orman's campaign surged earlier this fall after the Democratic candidate dropped out, suddenly making the Kansas race more competitive than expected. Recent polls show Orman and Roberts in a dead heat.
