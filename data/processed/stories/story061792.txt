A 4-year-old boy was killed after being mauled by his family's dog inside their Brooklyn, New York, apartment, according to police spokesman Joseph Gallagher.
Jayelin Graham was bitten multiple times in the head, neck and torso by his family's Cane Corso Mastiff, a large muscular breed of canine commonly used as a guard dog or hunting companion.
The deadly attack Friday night sent the boy to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival, according to Brookdale Hospital spokesman Andrew Rubin.
Two other small children, a 2- and 5-year-old boy, were in the home at the time but were unharmed.
Police say they are continuing to investigate the incident and that New York's Animal Care and Control have removed the dog as well as another dog -- a German shepherd -- from inside the apartment.
