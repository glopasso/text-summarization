(EW.com) -- Fox may have passed up the chance to develop "Modern Family" a few years back, but they still have Ed O'Neill's other big sitcom hit in the vault.
Fox is going to re-air the pilot to "Married ... with Children" as part of its 25th-anniversary celebration.
The episode will be followed by an encore of "The Simpsons'" 500th episode and then the network's 25th Anniversary Special.
The caustic family sitcom starring O'Neill as a lazy, bitter husband launched in 1987 and was a game-changing hit for Fox during its early years. The comedy also helped brand the network as having more of an edge than its more traditional broadcast rivals. The episode will air Sunday, April 22 at 7 p.m.
