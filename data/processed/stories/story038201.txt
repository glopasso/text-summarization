(CNN)Can't see Harry Potter's  Albus Dumbledore as gay? Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling has a terse message for you.
Rowling revealed that the Hogwarts School headmaster was gay after "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final book in the boy wizard series, was released in 2007.
Fan Ana Kocovic started the exchange by asking the author, "I wonder why you said that Dumbledore is gay because I can't see him in that way."
"Maybe because gay people just look like ... people?" Rowling wrote in her March 24 reply.
Rowling's fans loved it.
