Alana "Honey Boo Boo" Thompson and her family came out of a car crash without serious injuries Monday night, but "Mama June" says they're "really sore today."
The reality TV stars' Chevrolet Suburban collided with a pickup at an intersection in Milledgeville, Georgia, Police Maj. John Davis told CNN Tuesday.
"It was really scary for us, since it was the first time any of us had ever been in a wreck," "Mama June" Shannon said in a statement sent to CNN by TLC, the channel that carries the series. 
"Sugar Bear" Thompson -- Alana's father -- was driving the SUV when the crash happened, Davis said.
None of the family was taken to a hospital although there were complaints of pain, he said. Paramedics checked them out at the wreck scene, he said.
"We are definitely really sore today, but our top priority is to celebrate Pumpkin's birthday," the mother said.  "She turned 14 today, and no matter how sore we feel, we are going to go out and celebrate.  As always, we want to thank everyone for their support and well wishes."
Pumpkin is one of Alana's older sisters.
Police in Milledgeville, which is about 20 miles north of their hometown of McIntyre, Georgia, were still investigating, Davis said.
