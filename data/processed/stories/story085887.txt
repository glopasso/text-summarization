The Olympic Games have grown dramatically since 1908 when they were first held in London.
Then just a little more than 2,000 athletes -- nearly all of them men -- competed for 110 gold medals.
But this summer, more than five times that many athletes, 10,500, are expected to compete for 302 gold medals.
All gold medals, however, are not alike.
The ones that will be awarded over the next two weeks contain just 6 grams of gold. They're mostly silver.
A century ago, the gold medals were entirely gold.
As the 2012 Games get under way, here are some other interesting facts and figures to consider:
