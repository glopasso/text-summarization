An off-duty fire department official in Columbus, Ohio, had to be resuscitated Saturday after being struck by lightning, Columbus Fire Battalion Chief Tracy Smith told CNN.
The lieutenant with the Columbus Division of Fire went into cardiac arrest after the lightning strike at the Columbus Crew Stadium, Smith said.
He was transported to Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center where he remains in critical condition, Smith said.
According to the firefighters union's Facebook page, the man who was struck is Lt. Stu Tudor, and firefighters as well as Columbus Police Department personnel are keeping watch at Tudor's bedside.
The man was attending a charity soccer event, Smith said. The game was postponed because of the storm, according to the Columbus Crew Facebook page.
Brad Williams, who was attending the game with his 5-year-old son, said he didn't see Tudor get hit, but was among the thousands caught up in the intense storm.
"It was huge, we could literally feel it," Williams said of the lightning. "I could easily see everyone jump back gasping, 'Oh my God.'"
