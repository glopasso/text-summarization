A sun-powered egg-frying tutorial video posted by the Death Valley National Park sparked an egg-frying frenzy that left park officials cleaning up the mess.
The video posted on the Park's YouTube account featured a park employee demonstrating how to fry an egg using the sun and a skillet.
But now park officials are pleading for the video copycats to clean up after they have cooked their eggs. They said park grounds have become littered with egg shells and cartons.
A post on Death Valley's official Facebook page read, "An employee's posting of frying an egg in a pan in Death Valley was intended to demonstrate how hot it can get here. ... However, the Death Valley NP maintenance crew has been busy cleaning up eggs cracked directly on the sidewalk"
If you wish to try the egg-frying stunt for yourself, park officials request that you "use a pan or tin foil and properly dispose of the contents"
Temperatures in Death Valley this week have peaked at 129 degrees. Park officials have warned the public the extreme temperatures can have serious effects, "including hospitalization and potentially death."
