Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad is scheduled to visit Lebanon areas bordering  northern Israel  on Thursday as the Iranian president faces threats by a member of Israel's leadership.
Ahmadinejad is on a Lebanon tour, his first state  visit to the country.
Many Lebanese applaud Iran for helping rebuild parts of their country.
But the visit to Beirut and now the scheduled tour of the border area has sent alarm bells for some in Israel.
Israeli Knesset member Arieh Eldad has suggested that military  action might be needed.
"It   is our responsibility to stop anyone  who publicly calls for our   destruction," said Israeli Knesset member Arieh Eldad  from the   far-right National Union party.
"That responsibility means us  doing something and  not waiting for the  world to do something. If a  situation arises in which  Ahmadinejad is in  the cross-hairs of the IDF  (Israel Defense Forces), he should  be  killed."
The Iranian president is scheduled to visit Hezbollah stronghold villages such as Bint Jbeil and Maroun al-Ras, places that were at the heart of fighting in the 2006 war between  Hezbollah and Israel.
The debate has raged in Israel on what to do when Ahmadinejad gets to those areas.
"I think the best thing Israel can do is to make sure President Ahmadinejad goes back to Iran safely and he continues to be the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran because he himself is causing more damage to the regime and helping Israel than any other Iranian president could," said Meir Javendanfar, a Middle East analyst.
