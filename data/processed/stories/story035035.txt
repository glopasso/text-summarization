If only Mitt Romney could turn the Olympic torch on the newspaper headlines in London.
He's the "Party Pooper" in the Daily Mail, "Nowhere Man" in the Times of London and "Mitt the Twit" in The Sun.
This was not the storyline Romney and his team wanted when they journeyed overseas for a trip designed to burnish the GOP contender's foreign policy credentials.
Romney has yet to publicly acknowledge the outrage he set off in London when he appeared to question the city's "disconcerting" problems in gearing up for the Olympic Games.
In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan on Thursday, Romney chuckled when he was asked about the criticism.

"Well, I'm delighted to see the kind of support that has been around the torch for instance. I watched last night on BBC an entire program about the torch being run across Great Britain. And the kind of crowds. I guess millions of people that turned out to see the torch. That's what you hope to see," Romney told Morgan.
Asked about the controversy on NBC's "Today" show, Romney again sidestepped the question but declared London prepared.
"After being here a couple of days it looks to me like London is ready," Romney said.

"There's this guy called Mitt Romney who wants to know if we are ready. Are we ready? Yes we are," Johnson shouted at what sounded like a political rally, for President Obama.
Meanwhile on Twitter, the hashtag #RomneyShambles was trending on both sides of the Atlantic.
