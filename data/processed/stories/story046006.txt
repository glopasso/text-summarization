(CNN)  -- Embattled former Detroit, Michigan, Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was released from jail early Tuesday.
Kwame Kilpatrick appears for his sentencing October 28, 2008, in Detroit, Michigan.
Kilpatrick, his beard overgrown and bushy, was escorted out of Michigan's Wayne County jail as he dodged a crowd of reporters before getting into a car and was driven away, according to television footage from CNN affiliate WXYZ.
Kilpatrick spent 100 days in jail as part of a plea agreement connected to a sex scandal that rocked Detroit and caused the city council and governor of Michigan to push to impeach him.
Kilpatrick also agreed not to run for public office during his five years of probation.
He was expected to immediately leave the state for a job interview, WXYZ reported.
Kilpatrick pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair.
He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case.
He was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up the affair.
