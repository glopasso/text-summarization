A New York Police Department helicopter made an emergency landing in the water off Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn Wednesday afternoon, according to NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne.
Six people were aboard the aircraft. All got out safely but all six suffered minor back and neck injuries, according to Browne.
"They  were flying during our coverage of the presidential visit and  were on standby  for that and the United Nations General Assembly," said Browne, referring to President Barack Obama, in New York to speak at the United Nations.
Browne says the crew was coming in  for a landing at the time of the  crash. "They had some time and they were coming  in to top off their  fuel. They were not out of  fuel," he said.
"About 30 to 35 yards from the   (landing) field, there was some kind of mechanical difficulty which  caused them  to make an emergency landing on the water, " Browne said, adding that inflatable pontoons on the aircraft deployed around its skids.
Police  and private boats quickly  approached the chopper. "They (the crew)  stepped off the chopper onto the boats.  They were never in the water, "  Browne said.
Browne says there was a pilot and  co-pilot, a crew chief, a crew chief in training, and two scuba  divers on the helicopter.
Police Commissioner Ray Kelly met  with the crew at a local hospital. None of the crew was admitted to Lutheran Medical Center.
The National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the incident.
