Detroit Tigers outfielder Delmon Young was arrested in Manhattan on Friday and charged with aggravated harassment after a dispute with another man, New York police said.
Young appeared intoxicated when police arrived at the scene outside the Hilton New York hotel, and he was treated and released from a hospital Friday morning, police Detective Martin Speechley said. The other man, who was not identified, sustained minor injuries but refused treatment, Speechley said.
The aggravated harassment charge is a misdemeanor, but Speechley said the case is being investigated as a possible hate crime because of "religious statements made" during the dispute. If there is evidence to support a hate crime, the seriousness of the charge would be "elevated," he said.
A criminal complaint states Young made an anti-Semitic remark, according to CNN affiliate WABC.
Young did not speak to reporters on camera, but issued a statement.
"I sincerely regret what happened last night," Young said, according to WABC. "I take this matter very seriously and assure everyone that I will do everything I can to improve myself as a person and player."
The team issued a brief statement Friday afternoon.
"We are aware of the situation, however it is our club policy not to comment on pending legal matters," the statement said. "As we understand it, this is an allegation and we need to allow the legal process to take its course."
The Tigers are in New York for a three-game series against the Yankees. Detroit lost the first game Friday to the Yankees.
