Former Mexican President Felipe Calderon says he was several kilometers from the area where two explosions went off in Boston on Monday.
"We were watching the marathon a few kilometers from the finish line," Calderon wrote in a Twitter post.
"My solidarity is with the victims of the explosions of today in Boston and with the American people that unjustly suffers these acts," Calderon wrote.
Moments earlier, the former president had congratulated Mexicans who participated in the race.
Calderon, who governed Mexico from 2006 to 2012, is spending this academic year as a fellow at Harvard University.
