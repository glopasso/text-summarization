The current coach of Argentina's national team was staying at a clinic in northern Italy in a bid to lose weight when finance police swooped, Reuters.com reported.
The jewelry was said to be worth €4,000 ($5,888).
Italian tax authorities say he owes the country €31 million ($45 million) in back taxes from when he played for top league club Napoli between 1984 and 1991.
But Maradona says the Serie A club should have paid the taxes.

The 48-year old is under intense pressure in his native Argentina after a dismal World Cup qualifying campaign left his star-studded team in danger of missing their first tournament since 1970.
After a recent defeat against Paraguay he was quoted by FIFA.com as saying, "I am not afraid of criticism. I am afraid of nobody. I am doing my job, I have my team and I am going to go forward.  "I have been battling critics since I was 15 years old. Now I am 48 and I am going to continue to battle with them [the press]."
