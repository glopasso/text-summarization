Three people were shot to death in Chicago on Friday and Saturday, one week after a spate of Fourth of July violence left nine dead in the city.
Chicago Police Department News Affairs Officer Veejay Zala said the most recent death occurred when a man, 28, was shot in the back on West Devon Avenue about 3:20 p.m. Saturday.
Police said he was standing on the street when an unknown person killed him. That killing may be gang-related, Zala said.
On Friday, a 27-year-old man was killed and a woman wounded in domestic violence on South Rockwell Street, he said.
Also Friday, a man, 32, was killed on West Quincy Street in a possible drive-by shooting, Zala said.
Over the Fourth of July weekend, nine people were killed and more than 60 wounded, police said.
Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said in eight incidents, police fired guns at suspects or were fired upon. In two incidents, police shot and killed the suspects, both of whom were 16, he said.
McCarthy said lax state and federal gun laws played a part in the high rate of violence.
