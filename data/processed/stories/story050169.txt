The FBI is offering a $25,000 reward in the case of a Washington, D.C., man who was last seen with a missing 8-year-old girl and is now wanted in connection with his wife's killing.
The FBI released new photos and video surveillance of Kahlil Malik Tatum, 51, and Relisha Tenau Rudd, who disappeared from a homeless shelter where she lived.
Washington's Metropolitan Police Department issued an Amber Alert for the girl last week.
After the girl's disappearance, police discovered the body of Tatum's wife, Andrea Denise Tatum, 51, at a suburban Maryland motel.
Police in Prince George's County have issued a warrant for his arrest in his wife's slaying.
