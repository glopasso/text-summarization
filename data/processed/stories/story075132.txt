In New York and looking for excellent dining experiences that won't land you on your accounting department's blacklist when you file expenses?
You may want to check out the Michelin Guide's just-released Bib Gourmand picks, part of its 2015 New York City restaurant guide, which hit shelves October 1.
The list features a whopping 126 New York restaurants in the city's five boroughs singled out for offering high quality meals at moderate prices.
Michelin says eaters at these venues can enjoy two courses and a glass of wine or dessert for $40 or less (tax and gratuity not included).
The restaurants haven't been awarded Michelin stars, but are selected by the same anonymous food inspectors who dole out the highly coveted designations to New York City restaurants.
The 2015 list of Michelin-starred restaurants can be found online here.
Of the 126 restaurants awarded Bib Gourmand status there are 19 new additions, listed here in alphabetical order.
