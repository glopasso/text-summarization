After duking it out in 2012's often nasty presidential race, the campaign managers for Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama have joined forces.
Jim Messina, who ran the president's re-election, and Matt Rhoades, a veteran of the Romney operation, are working behind the scenes of Washington's bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.
The duo's specific project -- a small part of the overall mission -- is to convince the U.S. Olympic Committee, that yes, sometimes both parties can come together for a common purpose, and that Washington is not just a hotbed of partisan warfare all of the time.
To make the case, the Washington bid's team put together this video, posted online Tuesday featuring a bipartisan cast. Making cameo appearances are CNN contributor Newt Gingrich, the Republican former House speaker; Virginia's Democratic Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine; Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis; DC Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton; Mayor-elect Muriel Bowser; and to press the point, a losing presidential hopeful from each party, Democrat Howard Dean and Republican Bob Dole.
The trio of other remaining cities don't have to concern themselves with the political consideration. Boston, Los Angeles and the San Francisco bay area also are taking part in the bid selection process. The committee will choose early next year which of the remaining four American cities will be the finalist to compete in 2017 to be the International Olympic Committee's choice for the 2024 games.
