The sole survivor of a 2007 Connecticut home invasion has remarried, his father said Tuesday.
Dr. William Petit Jr. and photographer Christine Paluf were married Sunday, Petit's father told CNN in a telephone interview. They met while she was volunteering for the Petit Family Foundation, he said.
The couple became engaged shortly after Christmas, family friend Ann Baldwin told CNN in January.
The foundation was established after Petit's first wife and their two daughters were killed in the family's home in Cheshire, Connecticut. To honor their memories, the foundation funds programs for education and for those affected by chronic illness and violence, according to its website.
In the 2007 incident, two men entered the Petit home, beat and tied up William Petit and forced Jennifer Hawke-Petit to go to a bank and withdraw $15,000. The men then raped and strangled Hawke-Petit, 48, and molested 11-year-old Michaela before tying her and 17-year-old Hayley to their beds and setting the house afire.
The girls died from smoke inhalation but their father managed to escape from the basement.
Joshua Komisarjevsky and Steven Hayes, who had met at a halfway house, were tried and have been sentenced to death.
