(EW.com) -- We're not messing with you: ABC is canceling "Mind Games."
Effective immediately, the freshman drama series starring Christian Slater and Steve Zahn as psychologically manipulative problem solvers will be pulled from the network's schedule.
Repeats of Sunday night freshman drama "Resurrection" will air the next two Tuesdays at 10 p.m. instead, then "Celebrity Wife Swap" will take over the slot starting April 15. "Mind Games" debuted five weeks ago and has performed lousy in the ratings, the last episode averaging only 2 million viewers and a 0.7 rating among adults 18 to 49.
For Slater, it's been rough sledding on broadcast TV these past six years. "Mind Games" was his fourth TV show since 2008 and only one has made it to a second season (Fox's "Breaking In," which still didn't make it to a standard 22 episodes).
