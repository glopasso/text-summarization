Authorities evacuated more than 3,000 students from a California high school Wednesday after military officials at a nearby base said they found information related to a possible bomb threat.
The suspect -- a 22-year-old Navy medic who had been listed as AWOL -- turned himself in to authorities Wednesday afternoon, a military spokesman said.
Writings officials allegedly found in Hospitalman Daniel Morgan's quarters at Camp Pendleton's military barracks prompted the evacuation of an Orange County high school earlier in the day.
The writings said explosives had been placed at San Clemente High School, Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Jim Amormino said.
Authorities evacuated the school, but later declared that the campus was clear of explosives, said Marcus Walton, a spokesman for the Capistrano Unified School District.
"We do not believe he went to the high school. We're checking with military personnel, interviewing people to see (if) maybe he knew somebody at the high school," Amormino said. "We just don't know what his motive is at this time."
Wednesday was the first day at San Clemente High School, which has 3,200 students and 180 faculty.
