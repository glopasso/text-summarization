Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi tied the knot Saturday with longtime beau Jionni LaValle in a celebration in New Jersey inspired by the "Great Gatsby."
The reality TV star from the show "Jersey Shore" stuck to the theme in a demure wedding dress that was a far cry from the brash animal prints and plunging necklines for which she is known.
In a photo posted on her website, she wore an opulent beaded lace dress and a floor-length veil over her bright red hair. She also posted a shot of the couple's first matrimonial kiss.
"Here is the first picture of me and Jionni as husband and wife!" she commented.
She promised there would be more to come.
Polizzi and LaValle have two children together. Lorenzo was born in August 2012 and Giovanna arrived in September.
Polizzi's fans have been following preparations for the nuptials on MTV's "Snooki & JWOWW." She appears on the show with former "Jersey Store" cast member Jenni "JWOWW" Farley.
