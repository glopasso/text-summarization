Search and rescue teams are searching for more than 100 people still missing after a river-going ferry capsized in Bangladesh, with three bodies recovered so far, a police official says.
The boat, the Pinak-6, capsized late Monday morning in the Padma river, around 60 km (37 miles) south of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka.
Witnesses said the ferry had about 300 people on board when it sank. Jakir Hossain Majumder, a superintendent of police, told CNN three bodies had been found and up to 129 passengers remained missing,
Some 110 people survived the accident, he said.
"The ferry was overcrowded and the river was very rough because of bad weather," Majumder said. Authorities denied reports that the accident happened because of a collision.
One of the survivors, Abul Hossain, said that most people traveling on the boat's deck survived, but passengers in the cabins remained missing.
Exact numbers of missing were not initially available, as passenger manifests are often disregarded in the country. Overcrowding of ferries is a persistent problem in Bangladesh, which sees scores of casualties from ferry accidents every year.
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked rescuers to take all necessary steps to facilitate the rescue operation, and salvage the stricken vessel, the national news agency, Bangladesh Sangbad Sangstha, reported.
