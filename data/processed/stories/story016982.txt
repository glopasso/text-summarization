Teenage striker Neymar showed why some of Europe's biggest clubs are hot on his trail as he scored both goals in Brazil's 2-0 friendly international win over Scotland at Arsenal's Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
The 19-year-old Santos star is reported to be a transfer target for both Real Madrid and Chelsea when the season finishes and his display against the Scots will have only further enhanced his reputation.
Neymar has now scored three times in three appearances for his country as Brazil got back to winning form after recent defeats by both France and Argentina.
Brazil were always in control against a side that had never beaten them in nine previous meetings and they took the lead three minutes before half-time.
Andre Santos played a superb cross in from the left for Neymar, who was given too much space in the area before curling a low shot into the corner of the net.
And it was Neymar who secured the victory in the 77th minute, scoring from the penalty spot after he had been fouled in the area by Charlie Adam.
Meanwhile, the United States and Argentina shared a 1-1 draw in their friendly match at New Meadowlands Stadium, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets.
Esteban Cambiasso put Argentina ahead in the 42nd minute from close range after goalkeeper Tim Howard had saved Angel Di Maria's initial shot.
But the home side rallied and levelled on the hour mark when teenage substitute Juan Agudelo fired home after Argentina failed to deal with Landon Donovan's corner.
