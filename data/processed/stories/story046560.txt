- Here's more information on the Brady Act, and how it established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System in 1993: "(NICS) was established for Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs) to contact by telephone, or other electronic means, for information to be supplied immediately on whether the transfer of a firearm would be in violation of Section 922 (g) or (n) of Title 18, United States Code, or state law...
"The NICS is a national system that checks available records on persons who may be disqualified from receiving firearms. The FBI developed the system through a cooperative effort with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and local and state law enforcement agencies. The NICS is a computerized background check system designed to respond within 30 seconds on most background check inquiries so the FFLs receive an almost immediate response."
- Here's the Firearms Owners' Protection Act (FOPA) legislation from 1986. Attached to that bill was an amendment that would ban civilian ownership of fully automatic weapons.
Writes NPR: "Just as the bill was about to come to a final vote in that tumultuous House session, New Jersey Democrat William Hughes introduced an amendment. It would forbid the sale to civilians of all machine guns made after the law took effect.
There were enough Democrats to pass the amendment, so nobody objected when the presiding officer, New York Democrat Charles Rangel, called for a voice vote rather than a roll call vote on the machine gun ban."
- In the short term after the shooting in Newtown, and in the long term, America has seen a rise in gun sales. Here's how "The Atlantic" described it basing the data on background checks: "Since the school shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary, America has gone on an unprecedented gun-buying binge, the numbers of which are staggering."
Here are some of the ways gun laws have changed post-Newtown - some states have tightened gun laws, while others have loosened them.

"Morgan Spurlock Inside Man" - medical marijuana
- One of the main co-stars of this episode is Steve DeAngelo, who runs the Harborside Health Center. Here's some information about Steve, from his website: "Steve DeAngelo has almost four decades of activism and advocacy in the cannabis reform movement. ... Most of Steve's career has been spent at the intersection of advocacy and entrepreneurship, with a focus on creating profitable ventures that simultaneously advance his social goals. In addition to Harborside, these ventures include Ecolution, SteepHill Laboratory and The ArcView Group."
A couple notes from Harborside's mission statement: "Protect medical cannabis patients by providing a safe and affordable alternative to the dangerous circumstances of the illegal drug market.
"Honor the trust provided by our fellow citizens by faithfully and rigorously observing and enforcing the laws of the progressive, visionary city of Oakland, and the great state of California."
Find out more about the Harborside Health Center here (and here's their Twitter account).
- Here are some details about the Matt Davies case, from a website made to support his cause: "Matt's small business was permitted and complied with state laws and regulations. Through Matt's work providing qualified patients safe access to medical marijuana, the cities of Stockton and Sacramento, the State of California, and the federal government received more than $300,000 in taxes, and more than 60 Californians got good jobs."
But as of May 2013, Davies took a plea deal, and will serve a minimum of five years.
As for the Ogden Memo of 2009: "The Justice Department has provided federal prosecutors 'clarification and guidance' urging them to go after drug traffickers, but not patients and caregivers, in the 14 states that have medical marijuana laws."
- From Melinda Haag's bio: "She was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the United States Senate in August 2010...
"Ms. Haag is an experienced trial lawyer with 23 years of prosecutorial and private sector experience. She has personally handled cases in the areas of securities fraud, mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, antitrust, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, environmental, civil rights, defense contractor fraud, health care fraud, and money laundering. Ms. Haag's trial experience includes more than 19 jury and bench trials, including a number of complex white collar and civil rights cases."
- The Harborside ruling in December 2012 meant "their landlord cannot evict the business on the grounds that it violates federal law." However a setback came a couple of months later, when "a federal judge rejected a lawsuit the city had filed on behalf of the popular dispensary." It has stayed open while it continues to challenge the ruling.
