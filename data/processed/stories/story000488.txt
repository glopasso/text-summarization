Boeing resumed testing Monday of its 787 Dreamliner in an effort to receive certification from the Federal Aviation Administration, a company spokeswoman said.
The certification tests come two months after a fire on board one of the planes caused a power failure during a test flight.
Boeing halted tests after the November 9 incident. Boeing resumed in-house testing of the jet on December 23, and the FAA certification tests began Monday, said Boeing spokeswoman Lori Gunter.
Once the plane meets FAA approval, Boeing can begin filling orders for nearly 900 jets from around the world.
The Dreamliner is Boeing's next-generation passenger jet. It is touted as a highly fuel-efficient aircraft made largely with composite materials.
Boeing suspended test flights after the fire during a flight near Laredo, Texas, in November. The crew used backup systems to land the aircraft.
Engineers determined the problem started as a short circuit or an electrical arc in a power distribution panel, most likely caused by foreign debris, Boeing said.
