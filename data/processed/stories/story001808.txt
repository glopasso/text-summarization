The company was founded in 1968 by Bob Noyce and Gordon Moore, two of the original brains behind one of the major players in early computer chip development, Fairchild Semiconductors.
Intel launched its first microprocessor, the 4004, in November 1971, and it was followed by the 8008 and the 8080, which was used in one of the world's first personal computers.
The 4004, Intel's breakthrough invention, powered the Busicom calculator and paved the way for embedding intelligence in inanimate objects as well as the personal computer
