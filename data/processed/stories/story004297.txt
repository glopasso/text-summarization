After a bumpy road to the altar, Kandi Burruss has finally said "I do" to her longtime beau.
"The Real Housewives of Atlanta" star got hitched to Todd Tucker, one of the show's former producers, before family and friends in Atlanta on Friday evening, the show said on its website.
Burruss, a Grammy-winning singer and songwriter, is a former member of R&B group Xscape.
In the Bravo hit TV reality show, Burruss' mother continually expressed disappointment about her pending nuptials to Tucker, whom she described as opportunistic.
A clip from an upcoming episode shows Tucker confronting his future mother-in-law about her disapproval of their relationship.
The couple dated for years before they got engaged in 2013.
