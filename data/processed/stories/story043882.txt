(EW.com) -- For its upcoming miniseries "The 80s: The Decade that Made Us," Nat Geo Channel commissioned a pop culture survey asking participants important questions like, "Which of the following songs would you have made out to in the '80s?" and "Which of the following '80s TV family would you most want to be adopted by?"
