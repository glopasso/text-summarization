Deportivo Coruna goalkeepers Dudu Aouate and Gustavo Munua have been left out of the squad for the match at Villarreal after being involved in a fight during a training session on Friday.
Aouate needed six stitches in his face after being punched by Munua.
Radio Marca reported that Israel's Aouate had six stitches in his face after being punched by his Uruguayan counterpart in the dressing room.
"Following Friday morning's incident club president Augusto Cesar Lendoiro and coach Miguel Angel Lotina and his staff have decided not to use Aouate and Munua for the Villarreal game," the club said on its Web site.
Deportivo officials will have discussions with the two players to discuss the incident, which took place one day after Aouate complained about being dropped as the club's first-choice keeper.
"I'm hurt because I don't think this was a fair decision. Deportivo's problem has never been its goalkeeping," he told reporters.
Aouate, 30, was replaced by Munua, 29, as the club's number one goalkeeper after Deportivo's 2-1 league defeat at home against Osasuna lat month.
He had been first choice since arriving from Racing in 2006.
