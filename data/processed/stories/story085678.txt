The book critics have named their best books of 2014. Now, it's time to hear from the readers themselves.
This year, Goodreads, the website devoted to pairing up eager readers with books they'll love, asked its users to vote for the books they thought were irresistible in 2014.
The categories range from the typical -- fiction, nonfiction, history -- to the unique, like the category of best debut for a Goodreads author.
There are 20 categories in all, and after tallying up more than 3 million votes, the results for the 2014 Goodreads Choice Awards are in.
In fiction, the best book for Goodreads users was Rainbow Rowell's "Landline." The novel follows a TV writer in a crumbling marriage who uncovers a way to talk to her husband in the past, giving her the chance to rethink her marriage before the trouble started.
Rowell has won the hearts of Goodreads users before -- her young adult novel "Eleanor & Park" was the 2013 pick for best young adult book -- but that didn't make this year's win any less sweet. Rowell and other authors shared their excitement over the honor by posting appreciative notes on social media.
In the nonfiction category, Marina Keegan's "The Opposite of Loneliness" was chosen by Goodreads' users as the best of the year, an honor that was awarded posthumously.
Keegan died in a car accident in 2012, five days after graduating from Yale with a job at The New Yorker ahead of her. Although Keegan was just 22 at the time of her death, critics have raved about the insight and talent on display in her posthumous essay collection.
As for the top young adult book this year, Goodreads users elected E. Lockhart's "We Were Liars" as the best read.
Like the characters in her suspenseful novel would do, Lockhart wrote out her gratitude on her hands.
