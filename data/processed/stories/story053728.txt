Veteran Formula One driver Pedro de la Rosa has signed a two-year contract to race with Hispania, the Spanish team announced Tuesday.
The 40-year-old will vacate his current position as a test driver for British marque McLaren to join Hispania -- who first entered F1 in 2010.
"This is a very important step in my sporting career," the Spaniard told the sport's official website.
"I'm at a very good stage in terms of maturity and am prepared to take on this challenge, which motivates me hugely.
"I'm here to work hard, with modesty and humility, accepting where we are now but keeping in mind where we want to be in two years' time."
De la Rosa has started 85 F1 races over 12 years, but has not completed a full season since racing for Jaguar in 2002.
"The team's objective has always been to reinforce itself in every aspect: economically, technically and in a sporting aspect," said team principal Colin Kolles.
"Without a doubt, the addition of Pedro de la Rosa for next year will be a fundamental foundation in the development of our project.
"Apart from being a great person he is an experienced driver, as his career and prestige in Formula One prove. I give him my most sincere welcome. I am sure that he will adapt perfectly and that together we will achieve great things."
De la Rosa first entered F1 with Arrows in 1999 before joining Jaguar in 2001. He spent 2005 and 2006 with McLaren, but was then out of the sport for three years until racing for Sauber in 2010.
The Barcelona native raced for Sauber as a replacement for Sergio Perez at this year's race in Canada, after the Mexican was injured during a crash at the Monaco Grand Prix.
Hispania's second season in F1 has proved a struggle, with the team yet to score a point in 2011.
The 2011 season will come to a close with the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos on November 27.
