Formula One minnows HRT and Marussia have become the final two teams to unveil their cars for the 2012 season after passing mandatory crash tests.
Spanish-based HRT have been testing in Barcelona, taking advantage of filming day regulations which allow teams to run outside of official designated testing.
The team had been unable to get the new HRT F112 ready in time for last week's testing at the Circuit de Catalunya after a failed test.
But both drivers Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan have now got in vital track time ahead of the season-opener in Australia on March 18.
"The first impressions are good, certainly a step up from last year, " India's Karthikeyan told the official F1 website.
Spain's de la Rosa is also hoping the team, who run on a fraction of the budget being employed by the likes of Ferrari and McLaren, can improve during the season.
"From here it is our job to try to improve it and make progress," he said.
They are likely to be battling with Anglo-Russian team Marussia to avoid the wooden spoon in this year's constructors' championship.
Marussia's new car -- the MR01 -- has been running at Silverstone, again using filming day regulations ahead of the new season.
Chief designer Pat Symonds confirmed on the official F1 website that the car had finally come through its crash test problem which caused them to miss out on the Barcelona testing.
It allowed the driver line-up of Timo Glock and rookie Charles Pic to have some invaluable practice ahead of Australia.
"While we have a lot of catching up to do, we take heart from the fact that everything is on a more positive trajectory," said Symonds.
