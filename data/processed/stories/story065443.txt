A Minnesota man arrested after investigators found weapons and explosives in his home was scheduled to appear in federal court in St. Paul Monday afternoon.
Buford "Bucky" Rogers was arrested Friday after a search of his Montevideo, Minnesota, home turned up several explosives including Molotov cocktails and a suspected pipe bomb, according to the affidavit written by an FBI agent. The agent said firearms also were discovered including a Romanian AK-M assault rifle. Rogers, a convicted felon, was arrested on a charge of illegally possessing a gun.
"The FBI believes that a terror attack was disrupted by law enforcement personnel and that the lives of several local residents were potentially saved," the FBI said in a press release.
However, several law enforcement officials played down the possible threat.
One law enforcement official said the suspect in the case had anti-government views and called the case a domestic terrorism investigation. The official added this is not a matter involving any international terrorism groups such as al Qaeda.
According to court documents, Rogers told investigators he had fired the assault rifle at a gun range on two separate occasions. The court papers say Rogers, 24, is a felon legally barred from possessing firearms because he was convicted of third-degree burglary in 2011.
The documents do not provide any information on what Rogers allegedly intended to do with the explosives and guns. There also is no mention of what led law enforcement officers to search Rogers' home.
