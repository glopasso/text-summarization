A South Korea court ruled that both Apple and Samsung violated each other's patents, in a case that mimics legal battles between the electronics giants around the world.
The Seoul District Court ordered each side to pay the other damages. Apple must pay Samsung 40 million won ($35,300); Samsung is to pay Apple 25 million won ($22,000).
The court banned sales in South Korea of Apple's iPhone 4 and iPad 2, Samsung's Galaxy SII and Galaxy Nexus smartphones and Galaxy Tab and Galaxy 10.1 tablet computers.
Both Samsung and Apple may appeal the lower court decision.
The decision comes as a jury in California decides a similar patent case in the U.S., with much higher stakes for the companies.
Apple accuses Samsung of copying the design of the iPhone and iPad, and is suing Samsung for $2.5 billion. Samsung denies any wrongdoing and is counter suing Apple for $519 million, also for patent infringement.
Similar patent cases between Apple and Samsung are being heard in Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia.
