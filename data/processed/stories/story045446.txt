A municipal police captain was fatally shot while driving to work on Thursday in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, becoming the 49th municipal police officer killed since October 2010, authorities told CNN.
An average of five local police officers have been killed per month in Juarez during that period, municipal police spokesman Adrian Sanchez said.
Cmdr. Mario Martin Favela Portillo, 25, was shot by unknown gunmen traveling in a truck. The shooting happened about 2:30 p.m. in southwest Juarez, Sanchez said. The commander was in uniform.

"As in all the cases of murder, the police force is very frustrated and hurt. Favela was 25 years old and was registered in the local police when he was 20," Sanchez said.
Juarez is considered a flash point in Mexico's nearly five-year war on organized crime.
