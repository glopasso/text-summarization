A zip gun was found at a Houston-area high school Monday after the building was evacuated over fears of an unspecified, perceived threat, the Katy Independent School District said.
The device was secured and the building was cleared.
A student was taken into custody and charges are pending, the school district said in a statement on its website.
It described a zip gun as any device altered to propel an object designed to cause harm.
Seven Lakes High School in Katy was evacuated Monday after police "learned of a perceived threat on campus" about 10 a.m. CT, and students initially were sent to an enclosed area on the school's athletic fields, the district said.
About an hour later, authorities told district officials that a possible bomb was found in the building.
The FBI sent bomb technicians to help the county bomb squad in the case, said Agent Shauna Dunlap, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Houston.
Video from CNN affiliate KTRK showed a number of emergency vehicles parked outside the school early Monday afternoon.
Katy is about 25 miles west of Houston. Seven Lakes High has more than 3,800 students, according to its website.
