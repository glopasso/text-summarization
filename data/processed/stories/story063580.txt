Former Real Madrid and Monaco striker Fernando Morientes has returned to French football after joining Marseille on a free transfer
Morientes has joined Marseille after enduring a disappointing spell with Primera Liga side Valencia.
The 33-year-old, who was released by cash-strapped Primera Liga side Valencia at the end of last season, links-up again with Marseille coach Didier Deschamp, who brought the forward to Monaco in a loan spell in 2003/04.
During that time, Morientes built up a great relationship with Deschamps as the principality club reached the final of the Champions League, losing 3-0 to Porto.
Top 20 summer transfer targets
Morientes has also played for Albacete, Real Zaragoza and Liverpool. He left Liverpool in 2006 to join Valencia but made only 19 league appearances for Los Che last season, scoring one goal.
Deschamps has been busy in the summer transfer market as he prepares his side for life in the Champions League following their second-placed Ligue One finish to Bordeaux last season.
Moreintes is Deschamps' eighth summer recruit after Lucho Gonzalez, Stephane Mbia, Souleymane Diawara, Edouard Cisse, Cyril Rool, Elinton Andrade and Charley Fomen.
Morientes has not trained since being released by Valencia but the former Spanish international striker believes he will be fully fit in time for the new season.
"I have stopped for two months but I hope to be good in two weeks, fit in quickly and bring my qualities," Morientes told a news conference. "At 33-years-old I have a lot of experience, I can bring a lot on the pitch and in the dressing room."
