Pamela Anderson is set to bring a little Hollywood glamor to motorsport after becoming part owner of a sports car racing team.
The former Baywatch star has linked up with the Race Alliance team, which is competing in the inaugural FIA GT Series.
The Playboy pin-up ventured into motorsport in March 2012 when her and occasional racing driver Markus Fux fronted the Downforce1 European Le Mans teams.
Following the failure of that venture Fux and Anderson have teamed up with the Race Alliance team for the final three races of the GT Series' 2013 season.
"We want to make Race Alliance a recognizable name and have looked for the best drivers possible," a spokesman for the team told Autosport.com.
"The plan is to contest the full FIA GT Series next year, as well as the Nurburgring 24 Hours, and then look to NASCAR after that."
In Vitantonio Liuzzi and Mathias Lauda the Austrian team boasts two drivers of considerable pedigree.

Liuzzi spent six years in Formula One, including one season with Red Bull, while his teammate Lauda is the son of Austria's triple F1 world champion Niki Lauda.
Liuzzi and Lauda will be behind the wheel of a Ferrari 458 Italia when the team debuts in Slovakia this weekend.
Three dates remain on the GT Series' 2013 calendar, with Spain and Azerbaijan hosting races after Slovakia.
Competing against Anderson's team will be one led by rally driving legend Sebastian Loeb.
The Frenchman won a record nine World Rally Championships in a row between 2004 and 2012 and now heads the Sebastian Loeb Racing team.
