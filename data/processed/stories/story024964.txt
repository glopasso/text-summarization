Opening statements in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial will be heard Monday, April 29, with the first testimony soon to follow, the judge announced Tuesday.
Michael Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG Live, claiming the concert promoter was liable in the pop star's June 25, 2009, death.
Jury selection concluded Tuesday afternoon with selection of six alternates to back up the 12 jurors chosen Monday.
Jackson Lawyer Brian Panish called it a "good, diverse" jury after the 12 main jurors were seated Monday.
The main jury panel includes six men and six women, and there are four male and two females alternates.
The trial, which could last three or four months, is expected to include testimony from Prince and Paris Jackson, the singer's two oldest children, and a list of celebrity witnesses.
Jackson died two weeks before his "This Is It" comeback concerts, organized by AEG Live, were to have debuted in London in summer 2009.
Lawyers for Jackson's mother, Katherine; and children, Prince, Paris and Blanket, argue that AEG Live is liable because the company hired and supervised Dr. Conrad Murray, who used a surgical anesthetic in a fatal effort to treat the singer's insomnia as he prepared for the comeback concerts. Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and is serving a prison sentence.
AEG Live's lawyers argue that Jackson chose and controlled Murray.
The lawsuit seeks a judgment against AEG Live equal to the money Jackson would have earned over the course of his remaining lifetime if he had not died in 2009. If AEG Live is found liable, it could cost the company several billion dollars, according to estimates of Jackson's income potential.
AEG Live is a subsidiary of AEG, a global entertainment company that was up for sale recently with an $8 billion asking price.
