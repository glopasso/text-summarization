Legendary boxer Muhammad Ali is best known for his fluid, eloquent moves in the ring.
But a video released Tuesday as part of a fund-raising push for his Muhammad Ali Center shows the toll Parkinson's disease has taken on one of the greatest athletes of all time.
Appearing frail and unable to whisper a word, a thin Ali sits next to his wife as she announces a microfunding campaign to raise money and awareness for the Muhammad Ali Center, offering the public a chance to meet him during a special celebration in Ali's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, in October.
Since retiring from boxing three decades ago, before being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Ali, 71, has never retreated from public life, even as his body has broken down.
But even as he fights the disease, Ali's wife, Lonnie, says his commitment to humanity has never wavered.
Muhammed Ali: Fast Facts
Since emerging on the international stage by winning a gold medal in boxing in the 1960 Olympic Games, Muhammad Ali has spent six decades in public life. Serving as a United Nations Messenger of Peace, Ali has visited more than 100 countries, meeting world leaders and human rights agencies to provide humanitarian assistance.
The campaign announced Tuesday includes a partnership with Prizeo, a celebrity charity fund-raising social media platform where fans can donate as little as $3 to the campaign at www.Prizeo.com/Ali.
"A critical element of our mission is sharing Muhammad's legacy and using his core principles to inspire adults and children everywhere to be as great as they can be," said Lonnie Ali. "These principles are as relevant today as they were when Muhammad was a young man and perhaps resonate now more than ever."
