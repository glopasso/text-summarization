Avril Lavigne's husband, Chad Kroeger, has set a high bar for an anniversary gift.
On Twitter on Thursday, Lavigne briefly shared a photo of what Nickelback frontman Kroeger gave her in honor of their first wedding anniversary: a 17-carat diamond ring.
"I still can't believe my 1 year anniversary gift. 17 carat emerald cut. Wow. I love my hubby," Lavigne said in the tweet, which she's since removed without explanation.
The humongous sparkler is larger than the jewelry Kroeger proposed with. When he popped the question to Lavigne in 2012, he did it with a still impressive 14-carat diamond.
The two Canadian rockers went on to marry July 1, 2013.
