(CNN)  -- Lewis Hamilton will take time out from his preparations for the Malaysia Grand Prix to see his disabled half-brother follow in his footsteps and compete on the racing circuit for the first time.
The 2008 Formula One world champion will make the 10,500km trip from Kuala Lumpur to Britain to see Nicolas, who has cerebral palsy, make his racing debut at the Renault Clio Cup at Brands Hatch on April 2.
The 19-year-old son of Anthony Hamilton and his second wife Linda has suffered from the condition all his life and is unable to stand or walk for long periods of time, however, he is able to race alongside his able-bodied competitors courtesy of a specially modified car.
McLaren driver Hamilton has said in the past his younger sibling is his biggest inspiration and confirmed to reporters on Tuesday that he would be trackside to support Nicolas in his first race.
"I am the closest person to him but even I cannot comprehend what it must have been like to have the difficulties he has had," the Briton told reporters.
"I'm so proud of him. I'll just head back to see his qualifying and race and then pop back out. It's cool. I will get to watch lots of movies on the plane."
After attending the race the 26-year-old, who finished second behind reigning drivers' champion Sebastian Vettel in the first grand prix of the season in Australia last weekend, will then make the return journey to the far East ahead of the Sepang-event on April 8.
Meanwhile, the elder Hamilton brother has also confirmed he is set to appear alongside Holywood stars Owen Wilson, Michael Caine and Jason Isaacs in the sequel to the successful animated film Cars.
"Big news," he wrote on his official Twitter page on Monday. "I'm going to be in Disney Pixar's Cars 2. This is wicked."
Hamilton is the latest in a line of big-name racing champions who have made cameos in the Cars franchise, including retired American driver Mario Andretti and seven-time German F1 world champion Michael Schumacher.
