Mercedes and tire supplier Pirelli have been punished by world motorsport's governing body after conducting an unsanctioned tire test.
The Formula One team and Pirelli were called to an FIA tribunal following a three-day, 1,000 kilometer trial in Spain last month.
The FIA ruled Friday that the German manufacturer would not be able to take part in the upcoming young driver test event, with the team also having to split costs for the tribunal equally with Pirelli and the motorsort regulator.
Mercedes escaped a more severe penalty, with the tribunal having had the power to impose points penalties, fines or complete exclusion from the F1 world championship.
Despite punishing Mercedes, the tribunal concluded the team had no reason to think the test contravened competition rules, which forbid unsanctioned in-season testing.
It also ruled Pirelli had failed to offer other teams the chance to participate in the test.
The case was brought to a tribunal after rival teams Ferrari and Red Bull lodged a protest having learned of the test at the Circuit de Catalunya.

"The Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team acknowledges and accepts the decision of the FIA international tribunal published today," read a statement from the team released on Friday.
"Mercedes accepts the proportionate penalties of a reprimand and suspension from the forthcoming young driver test that have been decided upon by the tribunal.
"Mercedes would like to once again restate its firm belief in proper due process and commend the FIA for the principle of an independent disciplinary body.
"The team would furthermore like to thank the international tribunal and its president for the fair hearing it received.
"In the best interests of the sport, the team does not intend to avail itself of any right to appeal the decision."
Mercedes will be on the grid when the 2013 Formula One season continued with British Grand Prix on June 30.
