LeBron James and Dwyane Wade combined for 53 points to lead the defending NBA champion Miami Heat back to the finals with a 99-76 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday night.
The Heat will face the well-rested San Antonio Spurs, who swept the Memphis Grizzlies four games to none, and haven't played since May 27.
The NBA Finals begin Thursday in Miami.
Roy Hibbert led the Pacers, who surprisingly pushed the Heat to a deciding Game 7, with 18 points while David West chipped in 14.
James had 32 points, including 12 in the second quarter, to spark Miami.
Last year, the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in five games to win their second NBA championship. The Spurs have won four titles, the most recent in 2007.
The win for the Heat came on the same day point guard Jason Kidd announced his retirement after a 19-year career.
Kidd, a 10-time all-star, helped Dallas win its first NBA title in 2011. He played this season with the New York Knicks.
"My time in professional basketball has been an incredible journey, but one that must come to an end after 19 years," the 40-year-old said. "As I reflect on my time with the four teams I represented in the NBA, I look back fondly at every season and thank each and every one of my teammates and coaches that joined me on the court."
