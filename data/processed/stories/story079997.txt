"Two and a Half Men' is staging a "That '70s Show" reunion.
CBS has announced that Mila Kunis, who previously played Jackie on the retro sitcom and in real life plays the role of significant other to series star Ashton Kutcher, has been tapped to guest star in an upcoming episode.
Kunis will play Vivian, a young, beautiful, free-spirited world traveler who has an instant connection with Kutcher's Walden. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, except Walden meets Vivian, whom he thinks is "the one," just before he was set to propose to another woman.
Kunis, who played opposite husband-to-be Kutcher on "'70s Show" for eight seasons, will next be seen in "Jupiter Ascending," starring Channing Tatum, and currently lends her voice to Fox's "Family Guy."
