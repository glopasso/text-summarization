Embattled Republican Sen. Pat Roberts is enlisting high-profile GOP leaders to help his re-election chances, including former Senate majority leader and fellow Kansan Robert Dole.
The 91-year-old Dole campaigned Monday night in Dodge City with Roberts. That is the town Roberts listed as his residence, but the house is owned by two supporters. Dole, who will also appear alongside Roberts on Tuesday, last week taped a TV ad touting the three-term senator and has offered advice behind the scenes.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is considering running for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, will attend a fundraiser and public event for Roberts next Monday. He is stepping up his efforts on behalf of Republican candidates, hosting a Florida fundraiser Tuesday for several GOP Senate candidates.
"Sens. Bob Dole, John McCain, Rand Paul and Congressman Paul Ryan are all confirmed to campaign in Kansas as well. The Republican Party is uniting around Pat Roberts because he is the only candidate in this race who will ensure Harry Reid is no longer in control of the Senate," the campaign said.
The Kansas race has become competitive. Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out, leaving independent Greg Orman, a businessman, as Roberts' sole opponent.
