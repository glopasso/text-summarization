(CNN)Not every woman can say they have made out with both Ashton Kutcher and his fiancee, Mila Kunis.
Kunis revealed during an Ask Me Anything chat with fans on Reddit on Thursday that there is one actress with whom both she and Kutcher have locked lips.
"But here's a little-known fact: there's one person in the world that both Ashton and I have kissed, and that's Natalie Portman," said Kunis, who was promoting her new film, "Jupiter Ascending."
Kunis had some steamy kissing with Portman in the critically acclaimed film 2010 "Black Swan." Kutcher co-starred, and locked lips, with Portman in 2011's "No Strings Attached."
So, Is Portman a good kisser? Kunis says yes.
"She's a lovely kisser, very polite," Kunis wrote.
The actress and Kutcher, co-stars in TV's "That '70s Show," have been engaged since February 2014. They welcomed daughter Wyatt in October.
