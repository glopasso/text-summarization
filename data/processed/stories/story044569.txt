Former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has been killed. Here are the latest developments:
-- Reacting to the news of Gadhafi's death, Vice President Joe Biden said that "NATO got it right" and "the people of Libya got rid of a dictator."
-- The South African government said "a lasting and sustainable peaceful solution is possible through an all-inclusive political process."
-- Even with Gadhafi dead, analysts say it will likely take years for the country's oil to return to full production. It's thought that Libya is already producing about 350,000 barrels of oil per day, up from near zero during the depths of the conflict.
-- Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Gadhafi's death "clears the way for the Transitional National Council in Libya to begin to put together a representative government."
-- German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the death of Gadhafi is "important" for Libyans.
-- French President Nicolas Sarkozy's office called Gadhafi's "disappearance" Thursday a "major step" in the struggle by Libyans to "free themselves from dictatorship and violence."
