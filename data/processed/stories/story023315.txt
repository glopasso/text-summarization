Manchester City powered into the last 16 of the Europa League with a 4-0 win over holders Porto Wednesday at the Etihad Stadium.
The English Premier League leaders had a 2-1 advantage from the first leg in Portugal and went through 6-1 on aggregate.
It is the second boost in 24 hours for manager Roberto Mancini, who has finally drawn an apology from striker Carlos Tevez after a three-month standoff which left the Argentine star on the sidelines.
Tevez told the club's official website: "I wish to apologize sincerely and unreservedly to everybody I have let down and to whom my actions over the last few months have caused offence.
"My wish is to concentrate on playing football for Manchester City."

He also withdrew his appeal to the Premier League against a fine of six weeks' wages.
Mancini confirmed in his post-match interview that he had "no problem" with Tevez after his apology.
"He needs a good two to three weeks to train but if he is ready he can play," the Italian told ESPN.
Mancini picked a strong team for their second leg tie against Porto and he was rewarded when Sergio Aguero opened the scoring after just 18 seconds.
It was the 20th goal of the season for Tevez's international teammate.
Porto, watched by their former manager Andre Villas-Boas, enjoyed good possession, but rarely tested Joe Hart in the home goal.
Their fate was sealed when Aguero played in substitute Edin Dzeko for the second late on.
Porto had Rolando sent off for a second yellow card and City rubbed it in with further late strikes from David Silva and David Pizarro.
Manchester United, 2-0 up from their first leg, can join arch local rivals City in the last 16 when they face ff Ajax at Old Trafford Thursday, but will be missing Wayne Rooney for the match.
