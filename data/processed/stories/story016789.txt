Monica Lewinsky took another step into the public spotlight on Monday when she joined Twitter.
"#HereWeGo," the former White House intern who had an affair with President Bill Clinton tweeted early on Monday. Her account was quickly verified by the social media site.
Joining Twitter is just the latest step in Lewinsky's re-entry into public life. Lewinsky penned an essay in May for Vanity Fair about her life after the affair and her reaction to the news that Hillary Clinton refereed to her as a "narcissistic loony toon" in a conversation with a close friend.
Lewinsky, who is a contributor for Vanity Fair, wrote another essay for the magazine in July about online bullying.
Later on Monday, Lewinsky will give a speech at the Forbes Under 30 Summit, an appearance that is being billed as her first public speech in 13 years.
Lewinsky's remarks will focus on her life after the affair and scandal that led to Bill Clinton's impeachment.
"He and the rest of the world moved on — but she could not, a fate now realized, on various scales, by millions of people — from Jennifer Lawrence to random junior high schoolers—who find themselves tarred in public, permanent ways," Forbes writes about her speech. "Lewinsky, who last talked publicly 13 years ago, will offer a singular perspective on what happened to her, and the scourge of harassment in the digital age."
Lewinsky later tweeted that she was "excited (and nervous)" to speak at the event.
Lewinsky's reentry into public life comes at the same time that Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton's wife and the former secretary of state, is considering a run at the presidency.
During her book tour earlier this year, Clinton was repeatedly asked about Lewinsky's Vanity Fair essay.
Clinton told People that she did not read the Lewinsky essay. "I've moved on," she said.
