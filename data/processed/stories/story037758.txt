The death of an Arab bus driver discovered hanged in his bus near Jerusalem is generating controversy among Palestinians who reject the police finding of suicide.
Yousuf al-Ramouni of Jerusalem was found dead Sunday. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Monday on Twitter that findings of the autopsy indicate his death was "not criminal related whatsoever."
But the driver's brother, Oussama al-Ramouni, described seeing bruises and "signs of blood" on his brother's back.
"This is not the work of one individual but several individuals," he told CNN.
Yousuf al-Ramouni died the same day an Israeli was stabbed with a screwdriver near central Jerusalem, the latest in a string of stabbing attacks targeting Israelis.
The stabbing victim was taken to the hospital in moderate condition, Rosenfeld said Sunday.
CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.
