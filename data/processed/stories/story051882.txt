Anthony Michael will take a one shot lead going into the final round of the Alfred Dunhill Championship at Leopard Creek Country Club in South Africa.
Michael made a faltering start to his third round with bogeys at the first, third and seventh holes, but improved as the round progressed eventually picking up four birdies.
The South African carded a third round 71 to finish on 10-under par, one stroke ahead compatriot Dawie Van Der Walt and last year's champion Spain's Pablo Martin.
The 24-year-old Spaniard was one of only a handful of players to break 70 on Saturday thanks to eagles at the par five 13th followed by another at the 15th where he smashed his three-wood to eight feet and then holed the putt.
Last year's runner-up Charl Schwartzel posted a third round 69 to put him in a tie for fourth with another South African, Alex Haindl, on seven-under par.
Co-sanctioned by the European Tour and the South African Sunshine Tour, the Alfred Dunhill Championship is the opening tournament in the 2011 Race to Dubai.
Meanwhile, Iben Tinning has won the Dubai Ladies Masters at the Emirates Golf Club.
The Dane's closing round 69 gave her a winning score of 11-under, two shots ahead of Sweden's Anna Nordqvist and three better than England's Melissa Reid -- who finished third.
Michelle Wie carded a flawless final round 67 but had to settle for fifth place behind England's Florentyna Parker -- who led after the opening round -- and Christina Kim of the United States.
