Police in Jackson, Mississippi, have prepared an arrest warrant for former television host Gary Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, police spokesman Colendula Green told CNN.
Officers were called to the scene Monday afternoon but when police arrived, only one of the parties involved was there.
The victim "had been stopped at a red light and was rear-ended by a white Jeep, driven by Gary Collins," Green said.
Collins' lawyer, Tom Royals, said his client had gotten out of his vehicle, examined the accident, and exchanged information with the driver of the other car.
After calling the police, Collins left because he had been waiting for some time and he thought he had done all that was required, Royals said.
"The other party knew his information," Royals said. "And in fact Collins knew someone in the car. They talked a while and then he left."
Green agreed that the ex-actor had provided his contact information but said Jackson Police have cited Collins for leaving the scene of an accident, a misdemeanor. Police are waiting to execute the arrest warrant once a judge signs off on it.
The other driver is pressing charges, Green said.
"It was not a serious accident," Royals said. "It was really just a minor fender-bender."
Collins is known for being a TV and radio personality, and is married to former Miss America Mary Anne Mobley. As an actor, he is known his role in the television series "The Sixth Sense," and "The Wackiest Ship in the Army."
