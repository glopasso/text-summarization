(EW) -- From "dope" to "nope."
After Rihanna hit up "What What Happens Live" to tell Andy Cohen her thoughts on ex-boyfriend Chris Brown, the man himself took to L.A. radio station Power 106 to clarify their purportedly rekindled relationship. "No," Breezy told host Big Boy when asked whether he and RiRi have romantically reunited. "And that's just quick, a quick answer."
Watch the video to see it for yourself.
That echoes Rihanna's statements from last night's Cohen interview, where she denied the rumors that the former couple were dating again â€” despite the fact that he's collaborating with her on a track called "Nobodies Business" from her upcoming album Unapologetic. She did, however, call him "pretty dope" and "kinda alright."
So, what do you guys think about the pair's sudden approach to the issue? Do you believe them, or do you think they doth protest too much? Or would you rather drown out all the noise and just listen to the album when it hits streets? Let us know below.
