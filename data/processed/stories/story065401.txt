(EW.com) -- Lionel Richie's got once, twice, three times the friends you do.
As previously reported, CBS will be airing "ACM Presents: Lionel Richie and Friends in Concert" after the Academy of Country Music Awards telecast April 13.
And while the special event already boasted an impressive roster of country stars -- including Kenny Chesney, Jason Aldean, Lady Antebellum, Kenny Rogers, Rascal Flatts, The Band Perry, and Martina McBride -- it turns out there are even more guests waiting in the wings.
Luke Bryan, Sara Evans, Tim McGraw, and Jennifer Nettles are the night's newest additions, the ACM and Dick Clark Productions announced today.
The concert will feature a variety of offerings, from solo performances to duets with the man of the hour. Naturally, a whole bunch of Richie hits from the man's upcoming country duets album "Tuskegee," due March 27, will be addressed throughout the night; here's a peek at the itinerary:
Jason Aldean, "Say You Say Me"
The Band Perry, "Penny Lover"
Luke Bryan, "Running with the Night"
Lady Antebellum, "Truly"
Martina McBride, "Still"
Jennifer Nettles, "Hello"
Rascal Flatts, "Dancing on the Ceiling"
Kenny Chesney with Richie, "My Love"
Tim McGraw with Richie, "Sail On"
Kenny Rogers with Richie, "Lady"
The concert will tape April 2 at Las Vegas' MGM Grand Garden Arena, a day after the Awards ceremony.
