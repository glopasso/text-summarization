The sister and mother of Adis Medunjanin, accused in a suspected plot to bomb New York's subways, testified at his trial Wednesday in Brooklyn federal court.
Alisa Medunjanin, a 30-year-old nurse, gave a tearful account of how she, her brother and their parents were awakened in the middle of the night by more than a dozen FBI agents who stormed into the family's Queens, New York, apartment during a September 2009 raid.
Crying on the stand, she said agents "told us to get on the ground and put up our hands. Then, they cuffed us."
She testified that she and her mother were later escorted to the lobby of the apartment building while federal agents questioned her father and brother.

Speaking through a Bosnian interpreter, Medunjanin's mother, Favila, told jurors that FBI investigators showed up at her work and told her that her son should "tell them what he knows."
Defense lawyers want to show that federal agents intimidated the family and unfairly coerced Adis Medunjanin into making incriminating statements.
Prosecutors say Medunjanin, a Bosnian-born American, conspired with admitted terrorists Najubullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay to detonate bombs in New York subways in 2009.
Medunjanin has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and receiving terrorist training from al Qaeda.
Medunjanin faces life in prison if convicted. Co-conspirators Zazi, an immigrant from Pakistan, and Ahmedzay, an immigrant from Afghanistan, have already pleaded guilty.
Closing arguments are expected Thursday.
