Comedic actress Jenny McCarthy will fill one of the empty seats around the table on "The View" vacated by Joy Behar and Elisabeth Hasselbeck, ABC announced Monday.
McCarthy, who has been on the daytime talk show 17 times -- eight as a co-host -- will become a permanent co-host when season 17 kicks off on September 9, according to the network.
"Jenny brings us intelligence as well as warmth and humor," said "View" co-founder Barbara Walters. "She can be serious and outrageous. She has connected with our audience and offers a fresh point of view."
The announcement quotes McCarthy, 40, saying she is "beyond thrilled" to take her place alongside Walters "and the other amazing women at the table."
"I look forward to helping make hot topics a little bit hotter, and showing my mom that my interrupting skills have finally paid off," McCarthy said.
She also thanks VH1 for allowing her to take the job by releasing her from her contract with the cable channel, which aired "The Jenny McCarthy Show."
McCarthy's entertainment career launched with a nude spread in Playboy magazine in 1993. She was named 1994 Playmate of the Year.
Her film credits include roles in "Scream 3" and "Scary Movie 3." She is also a best-selling author.
What do you think of McCarthy as a choice to co-host "The View." If you disagree, who would you have hired?
