A drummer for country music star Kellie Pickler was seriously injured in a pileup crash on Interstate 65 in Kentucky, officials said.
Gregg Lohman, 36, was airlifted from the crash site Saturday with head and neck injuries, Master Trooper Norman Chaffins of Kentucky State Police told CNN affiliate WAVE. Lohman was in critical but stable condition Sunday at a Louisville hospital.
Pickler confirmed the crash on her Facebook page Sunday:
"Yesterday, my drummer Gregg Lohman was in a horrific car accident and is currently in ICU," the "Red High Heels" singer wrote.
"Gregg is not just my drummer, he is family. I believe in miracles and the power of prayer, so it would mean the world to me, my band, and Gregg's family if you would please keep him in your prayers. Thank y'all so much."
Lohman had slowed down for an earlier, fiery crash on the interstate when another driver failed to notice the slowed traffic and crashed into the back of Lohman's truck, police told WAVE. Lohman's truck then hit another vehicle, which rear-ended yet another.
Six people from the same family were killed in the initial, fiery crash, WAVE said.
Two others were injured in the pileup crash involving Lohman, but both were treated and released.
Lohman, who has also performed with Lady Antebellum and SHeDAISY, is also a percussion instructor at Tennessee State University.
