(Rolling Stone) -- When Kanye West suggested a remix, with Raekwon, of Justin Bieber's "Runaway Love" to Bieber over Twitter this past weekend, few would have guessed the collaboration might actually happen. But Raekwon has told XXL that the remix is already in the works, and Kanye tweeted that he was hitting the studio with Raekwon today.
"It's definitely gonna happen," Raekwon said. "When you got these kinda talents merging together to do something exciting, I think it's something that's gonna make the fans check it out. I'm a big fan of both of these guys. I think, at the end of the day, shorty [Bieber] is a sensation. And [for him] to acknowledge me it makes me feel good that the young generation is checkin' me out like that. And at the same time it gives me a position to play a big brother in the game. He wants my assistance or whatever, he can get it. I respect him, I like his style."
Kanye, meanwhile, has taken to Twitter to sing Wu Tang Clan's praises. "Wu mixed education, originality, reality and general fresh as hellness. We can only pray to make music on that level every time we create," Kanye wrote. "Respect to the whole Wu Tang for being the most influential movement in my life...I think about Ghost Face every time I look at jewelry...Who remember the purple tape [Only Built 4 Cuban Linx on cassette version]?! Raekwon album not only changed my life it dictated it and yes I spent my first check on a Cuban link chain."
