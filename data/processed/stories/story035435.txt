Disney star Mia Talerico is learning at a very young age about the dangers of celebrity. Someone posted online death threats against the 5-year-old actress, police said.
Talerico plays Charlie in "Good Luck Charlie," a hit Disney Channel series that has been canceled after 100 episodes. The final show airs in February.
The Los Angeles Police Department's threat management unit is investigating the threats, according to LAPD spokesman Andrew Smith.
Police are not disclosing the nature of the threats because of the investigation is "very sensitive," Smith said.
A Disney spokesman replied "no comment" when asked by CNN.
CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed this report.
