Now that the Ice Bucket Challenge has made the rounds, a new trend is on the rise: crotch grabbing -- for testicular cancer.
Stars such as Hugh Jackman and William Shatner have already participated in the Feeling Nuts Challenge, which you can follow online with the hashtag #feelingnuts.
Why testicular cancer awareness? Unlike some other cancers, testicular cancer typically affects young men, with an average age of diagnosis 33, according to American Cancer Society. The organization estimates that 8,820 new cases of testicular cancer will be diagnosed this year in the United States.
Fortunately, it is highly treatable if discovered early.
Men who have cryptorchidism, or an undescended testicle, are more at risk, along with those with a family history of the cancer. White males have the highest risk, followed by Latino, Asian-American and black men, according to the ACS.
So if you're joining the Feeling Nuts Challenge, feel for lumps and follow up with a doctor if anything seems amiss.
