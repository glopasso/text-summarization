Maria Sharapova headed the pack as four of the top 10 seeds at the Western and Southern Open advanced to the third round of the Cincinnati event with wins on Tuesday.
Fourth seed Sharapova, a beaten finalist at the Lindner Family Tennis Center last year, secured her place in the third round with a 6-1 6-3 victory over Australian qualifier Anastasia Rodionova.
Sharapova, a three-time grand slam winner, is joined in the next round by French Open champion Li Na.
Li, seeded fifth, recorded a straight-sets 6-3 6-4 success against the Czech Republic's Lucia Safarova.
Can anybody stop Novak and Serena?
The 29-year-old was pleased with her return to form having been eliminated from last week's Rogers Cup in the first round.
"It was tough but I was happy I could win today," Li told the WTA Tour's official web site.
"I've been missing a lot of shots so I need some more matches on hard courts.
"It's not one thing like my running, my forehand or backhand -- it's just my timing. I need some more matches to find my timing again."
Wimbledon winner Petra Kvitova also enjoyed a victory as the 21-year-old sixth seed disposed of South Africa's Chanelle Scheepers 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.
France's Marion Bartoli was the other top 10 seed in action, and the 26-year-old breezed past Ukrainian Alona Bondarenko 6-1 6-2 in just 63 minutes.
The first round was completed on Tuesday, with American Serena Williams continuing the form which saw her claim the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Canada last weekend.
Williams, currently ranked 31 in the world after suffering with injury and illness over the past year, almost let a 5-1 lead slip in the second set of her match against Lucia Hradecka, but recovered to score a 6-3 7-6 (7-5) win.
The 13-time major champion will now come up against Australian 10th seed Samantha Stosur, who beat qualifier Eleni Danilidou 6-3 6-1.
