(EW.com) -- Robin Roberts has returned to the set of "Good Morning America" -- but isn't making her TV return just yet.
She arrived at the Times Square studio at 5 a.m., ABC reports, for her first in a series of dry runs before returning to her anchor role. "My doctors want me to see how many people I actually come in contact with. How my body reacts to the stimulation, that's code word for stress, of being in the studio environment," she explained. "My skin is very sensitive and so we have to see how it reacts to the studio lights. My vision is still a little blurry from the treatment. All of this is getting better day by day so that is the next step."

This is the next phase of recovery for Roberts, who had a bone marrow transplant in September to treat myelodysplastic syndrome, and has been off the air since the end of August.
Last week, Roberts said in a video interview with the "GMA" team that she hopes to be back in the anchor chair sometime in February. "I have a date in mind that is very important to me," she said. "But I will ultimately listen to what my doctors say and what they recommend."
