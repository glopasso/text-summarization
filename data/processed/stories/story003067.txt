It has been a busy 10 days for Andros Townsend.
The 22-year-old scored on his England debut, signed a new four year contract with Tottenham and then duly rewarded the club by helping them to a 2-0 victory at Aston Villa in Sunday's only Premier League match.
The winger pumped in a left footed cross which curled beautifully into the net to put Spurs on their way after 30 minutes.
It was a marauding display from the childhood Tottenham fan -- who now finds himself hailed as England's newest star -- as he prowled the right wing and almost doubled his tally on more than one occasion.
"It's been one of the best few weeks of my life," Townsend told broadcaster Sky Sports after the match.
"Scoring for my country on my debut is a highlight but the main thing for me now is not to get carried away and keep my feet on my ground."
Aston Villa's prized possession Christian Benteke came off the bench in the second half to try to grab a share of the points for his team.
The striker, who has made a quick return from a hip injury, tested Tottenham's defense but he nodded his best effort over the bar.
Andreas Weimann had earlier failed to find an elusive equalizer when he drove a fierce shot just wide.
Spurs put victory beyond the home side when Roberto Soldado collected Paulinho's pass and chipped past American keeper Brad Guzan in the 69th minute.
The away win saw Tottenham move up to fifth in the Premier League table, which is led by north London rivals Arsenal. Defeat saw Villa drop down to 13th.
There was a sour note to Tottenham's victory when a flare was thrown from the club's section of traveling fans in response to Townsend's opening goal.
The canister hit a linesman on the back of the neck although he was able to carry on with his duties.
