A roundup of reactions to the death of television producer and longtime "American Bandstand" host Dick Clark, who died Wednesday:
"He was an entrepreneur, a visionary and a major force in changing pop culture and ultimately influencing integration. It happened first emotionally. Music can do that. He didn't do it from a soap box, he just did it. That's who he was."
-- Stevie Wonder
"Dick Clark was the rare exception who was a bigger person in real life than the public image or legend that was also to be his legacy."
-- Paul Stanley of KISS
"Not only did he create a beloved platform that allowed numerous, gifted artists to break through -- he single-handedly redefined popular culture." -- The Jacksons (Jermaine, Jackie, Tito and Marlan)
"If someone cannot fill your shoes, you are a legend. And Dick Clark was a legend."
-- Donny Osmond, to CNN's "Piers Morgan Tonight"
"Dick Clark, with all the fame and money, wasn't a limousine guy."
-- Larry King
"He was one of the top people that you wanted to get your music to. And you knew that if he put you on his show, you were a success. And, yes, he produced a lot of things, but he produced it because he loved it."
-- Gloria Estefan
"What he did for music was just beyond explanation. If it was not for Dick Clark, I don't think Motown would have been the company it was. ... He did everything with class, style and integrity."
-- Berry Gordy, Motown founder, to CNN's "AC360"
"If you didn't go on 'American Bandstand,' you hadn't made it yet."
-- Aretha Franklin, to CNN
"You are never really prepared for this day. ... He just seemed to have had some of the fountain of youth in him. There's a great word that is synonymous with Dick, and that's 'loyal.' Loyalty is a lost art today, and it applies so much to Dick."
-- Jean Kasem, wife of longtime "American Top 40" host Casey Kasem and family friend
"Anything Dick Clark touched, it turned to success. He knows what he is doing and he knows how to do it."
-- Little Richard, to CNN
"I think only God is responsible for making more stars than Dick Clark. I really do. I think he really was the manufacturer of the music business as we know it today. He was the Pied Piper, he was the guy who created careers, (but) he was also a mentor and cared about you as a person."
-- Tony Orlando
"This is a sad day. He was a dear friend, supporting me and my music for all of my years in the business. A great businessman and a true gentleman. An inspiration. My heart is so heavy now."
-- Barry Manilow
"I was very sad to here this news. We all felt Dick was always this handsome teenager, as we all got older, Dick remained a teenager. I will always appreciate what he did for me and for popular music. He presented Motown and The Supremes on tour with the Caravan of Stars and on 'American Bandstand' where I got my start. Dick Clark was a pioneer, he was a music star maker, he was a legend and was my friend. He said that 'music is the soundtrack of your life.' Since I was 16, he was always a part of mine."
-- Diana Ross
"With 'American Bandstand,' he introduced decades' worth of viewers to the music of our times. He reshaped the television landscape forever as a creative and innovative producer. And, of course, for 40 years, we welcomed him into our homes to ring in the New Year. But more important than his groundbreaking achievements was the way he made us feel -- as young and vibrant and optimistic as he was."
-- President Barack Obama
"Rest in Peace my good friend Dick Clark. A pioneer who's mark on American culture will be felt forever."
-- Quincy Jones, producer, via Twitter
