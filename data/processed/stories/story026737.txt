At least five homes were destroyed after a tornado touched down in western Oklahoma Monday evening, authorities said. There were no reports of injuries.
Other homes were damaged, and power was out to about 900 residences in and around the city of Hammon in Roger Mills County, Oklahoma, Michelann Ooten of the Department of Emergency Management said.
Roger Mills officials continued to assess the damage, but all residents appear to be accounted for, Ooten said.
The tornado hit about 5:30 p.m. (6:30 p.m. ET), said Ken Gallant, lead forecaster for the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma.
The thunderstorms that produced the conditions for the tornado weakened shortly afterward and a tornado warning was canceled, Gallant said.
Jerry Dean, county commissioner of Roger Mills, said the county barn was among the structures destroyed.
Area residents had time to prepare before the tornado hit, Dean said.
He could see the tornado coming before going into a cellar to wait it out, he said.
