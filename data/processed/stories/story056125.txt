Oracle Team USA's improbable America's Cup comeback gathered further momentum on Monday after a fifth straight win over challengers Emirates Team New Zealand.
Emirates Team New Zealand have been one win away from clinching the Auld Mug since last Wednesday, but Oracle Team USA never looked like losing Monday's race at San Francisco Bay.
The New Zealanders still hold an 8-6 advantage over their American counterparts in the best-of-17 series.
The Americans started their defense of the cup on minus two after being punished for illegally modifying their catamarans.
In order to prevent defeat, Oracle Team USA need to win the final three races of the competition, starting with race 17 on Tuesday, with race 18 scheduled to take place the same day should it be required.
"We've got a huge wave of momentum. The boat's just going fantastic," Oracle Team USA skipper Jimmy Spithill told the official America's Cup website.
"That was a tough start, we had starboard entry and it was a tough time."
Emirates Team New Zealand skipper Dean Barker remains confident his team can win the series despite Oracle's recent charge.
"We're very upbeat here, we know we can win," said Barker. "The Oracle guys sailed a pretty flawless race.
"There were no opportunities to get back in it. We did a better job on the downwind legs staying close, but not enough today."
