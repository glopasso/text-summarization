Activists were calling for students to walk out of school and employees to walk off the job nationwide Monday to protest police violence.
Organizers said at least 60 such events were planned around the country, mostly at colleges and universities, according to a website listing the protests.
At the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, protesters planned a die-in at the student union, while demonstrators in Illinois were asking students and employees along the Chicago Loop to walk out of school and work together, to name a few of the planned demonstrations.
In solidarity with Ferguson, Missouri, most of the protests were planned at 12:01 p.m. CT, the time Michael Brown was shot.
Over the Thanksgiving weekend, Ferguson-area organizers called for a Black Friday shopping boycott, forcing the St. Louis Galleria Mall to shut down temporarily on the busiest shopping day of the year.
St. Louis officials urged Galleria retailers to close security gates after several hundred protesters entered the mall and disrupted shopping.
Protesters chanted, "Hands up, don't shop," while others lay on the floor in a "die-in."
If supporters did shop, they were told to take their money to black-owned businesses, some of which were listed on social media. Brown, the teenager, was black; Officer Darren Wilson, who shot him, is white.
