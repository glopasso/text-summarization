They wore feathers. They wore fancy hats. And of course, they wore fur.
Never mind the human -- the dog in haute couture was the fashionistas' focus during Pet Fashion Week.

It was Pet Fashion Week New York and these canines were not wearing the boring plaid raincoats that have sold for years. They were wearing one-of-kind design creations.
The show last weekend was aimed at owners of sophisticated canines who may be willing to pay for their pup's own stylist.
Booths at the annual event features couture clothing, jewelry and other accessories for the well-dressed doggie -- all part of the $40 billion pet industry. E-mail to a friend
