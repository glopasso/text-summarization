"I brings the ruckus to the ladies!"
So said the character Leon Black to Larry David on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" in a scene we'd share if it was even mildly safe for work.
But there's only a fine line between comedian JB Smoove and his character on the hit HBO series.
"Leon's the guy that lives in the moment," Smoove says. "Who doesn't want a guy like that around? He brings the ruckus! Leon just happens to have a high level of ruckus-ness. He's more in the ninety percent range. Me, JB, I'm more in the 50% range."
This, of course, begs the question... just what the hell is the ruckus?
Smoove, who also played the cab driver in the car chase scene from the movie "Date Night," explains, "The ruckus is different experiences you go through throughout your life which builds your ruckus points up -- your tolerance. You've got to have a high tolerance for dealing with stuff all the time."
Leon, Smoove says, is the guy you take with you to court to fight a ticket. "He knows a little bit about everything."
Naturally, this also includes how to treat a lady. The comedian shares some of his moves in the video above.
