America has beaches, too.
That's the message from the 2014 U.S. News and World Report "World's Best Places to Visit" rankings for the United States.
On the U.S. list, Maui jumped six places from last year's rankings to steal the top spot from Yellowstone National Park, which fell to second place.
"When we think about American vacations, people are less inclined to think of beach cities per se, at least before big cities like New York, Chicago or our National Parks," said Allison Michaels, the site's travel editor. "So it's interesting to see a beach destination rise to the top. "
Washington D.C., San Francisco and New York City rounded out the top five vacation destinations, whose rankings are based on a formula combining online reader votes with the opinion of reputable travel writers.
