Stephen Colbert may make his career mocking people, but this time he says he didn't go as far as the outraged Internet believes.
The hashtag #CancelColbert started to trend after a tweet from the verified Twitter account for "The Colbert Report" tweeted on Thursday, "I am willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching Chong Ding Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever."
The tweet (which has since been deleted) was a riff on a skit Colbert did Wednesday on his Comedy Central show poking fun at Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder's announcement of a foundation to help Native Americans. The team has been at the center of controversy for having a name some deem to be racist.
Colbert's character on his show is ultra-conservative and often makes outrageous statements, including his impression of "Ching Chong Ding Dong," which mocks Asian stereotypes. But without the context of the TV show skit the tweet outraged many.
Twitter user Arnesa wrote "Et tu, Stephen? Not funny. It doesn't prove your point. It makes you 'no better' than the racists. https://twitter.com/colbertreport/status/449320692446920704 ... #cancelcolbert." A user named Micha tweeted "#CancelColbert Satire to make fun of racists isn't supposed to be hurtful to those who are affected by racism, or you're doing it wrong."
The funnyman used his Twitter account to deny he was involved with the tweet.
"#CancelColbert - I agree! Just saw @ColbertReport tweet. I share your rage.
Who is that, though? I'm @StephenAtHome," Colbert tweeted with a link to a video of his skit.
"The Colbert Report" account seconded that, tweeting, "For the record @ColbertReport is not controlled by Stephen Colbert or his show. He is @StephenAtHome Sorry for the confusion #CancelColbert" and "This is a Comedy Central account, with no oversight from Stephen/show. Here is quoted line in context http://on.cc.com/1dyeQri #cancelcolbert."
What do you think? Is it a case of satire going too far?
