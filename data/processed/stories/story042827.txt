Kelly Clarkson tweeted confirmation of her weekend marriage to Brandon Blackstock on Monday, along with three photos from the wedding day.
"I'm officially Mrs. Blackstock :) We got married yesterday at Blackberry Farms in TN, the most beautiful place ever!" Clarkson wrote.
The first photograph showed the couple standing at the entrance to covered wooden bridge, with Clarkson, 31, holding a sunflower bouquet and Blackstock kissing her.
Another picture shows the couple kissing in a grassy field, while the third is a closer shot of Clarkson standing alone with her bouquet.
Blackberry Farm is a rural resort in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains, about 30 miles south of Knoxville.
Clarkson, the first "American Idol" winner, announced her engagement to Blackstock, a talent mananger and father of two, in December.
The singer told People magazine in August that the couple decided to forgo a large wedding in favor of an intimate gathering.
" 'Thank you so much for understanding, but it's just going to be me and Brandon and his two kids and the minister,' " Clarkson said she told friends and family.
