Few travel pleasures match checking into a room few others have stayed in.
From Rhode Island to Santa Barbara, South Beach to Kauai, new hotels just steps from the beach are marking their first summer -- it's not over yet! -- in business.
Amenities like loaner golf clubs (good ones, too) and morning yoga on a rooftop make these new beach hotels worth an extended stay.
The Break (Narragansett, Rhode Island)
As 'Gansett's first boutique hotel, The Break expects to close out summer with a bang after its in mid-August opening.
Crisp, colorful hues highlight each of the 16 rooms, including coral-motif pillows and nightstands the color of tangerines that provide a mid-century, surf-chic vibe.
The Break, 1208 Ocean Road, Narragansett, Rhode Island; +1 401 363 9800; rates not available
Vintro Hotel & Kitchen (Miami Beach, Florida)
As if South Beach isn't already stylish, Vintro Hotel & Kitchen joined the crop in July.
The 50-room hotel with a freshwater plunge pool on its rooftop (where morning yoga is hosted) borders the newly renovated Collins Canal.
Guests can borrow bicycles and golf clubs.
A beach club is two blocks away.
Vintro Hotel & Kitchen, 2216 Park Ave., Miami Beach, Florida; +1 305 674 9200; rooms from $190 per night
21 Broad (Nantucket, Massachusetts)
This new hotel is decked out in colors that evoke citrus fruits and the decor has an urban bent.
There's a turntable in the lobby and an outdoor courtyard with a fire pit.
Each of the 27 rooms features amenities like a four-poster bed and shower head infused with vitamin C.
Well, hey, it's novel.
The food at 21 Broad is just as fresh.
21 Broad, 21 Broad St., Nantucket, Massachusetts; +1 508 228 4749; rooms from $359 per night
Hotel Zamora (St. Pete Beach, Florida)
Perhaps playing off the mod surrealism at the nearby Salvador Dali Museum, the Hotel Zamora flaunts a whitewashed exterior reminiscent of the Mediterranean, particularly its namesake Zamora, Spain.
Walk-in spa showers in each room remove sand from your skin with a luxurious twist.
Tapas such as lobster fries and yucca chorizo hash are available at the hotel's Castile restaurant.
There's also a cool rooftop bar.
Hotel Zamora, 3701 Gulf Blvd., St. Pete Beach, Florida; +1 855 926 6721; rooms from $170 per night
Metropolitan by COMO (Miami)
The first U.S. property from Singapore-based COMO Hotels and Resorts, this 74-room hotel is located in a 1930s building in the Art Deco District.
With direct access to the beach, the atmosphere inside is relaxing, with peppermint-green hues and white marble.
The on-site restaurants are excellent -- Traymore serves Florida seafood, and a poolside eatery does pizza baked in a wood oven.
Metropolitan by COMO, 2445 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, Florida; +1 305 695 3600; rooms from $188 per night
Kauai Shores (Kauai, Hawaii)
Kauai Shores, an Aqua Hotel, is located on Kauai's Coconut Coast, on the eastern shore of the island.
Its 200 retro-modern rooms are basic but were renovated under a re-branding and name change in June and are divided between just two floors.
Beachfront access is the hotel's best perk, but its two outdoor pools are also nice.
It's an affordable option on notoriously pricey Kauai.
Kauai Shores, 420 Papaloa Road, Kapaa, Kauai, Hawaii; +1 808 954 7413; rooms from $89 per night
The Goodland (Goleta, California)
As a Kimpton property, The Goodland exudes high style.
With a September 4 grand opening scheduled, the 158-room, 1960s-inspired hotel just outside of Santa Barbara bridges a casual surf lodge with a modern hotel.
Daily fitness classes are offered -- there's also a spa and outdoor pool.
You can eat al freso at Outpost at the Goodland, where dishes include fish tacos.
The Goodland, 5650 Calle Real, Goleta, California: +1 805 964 6241; rooms from $200 per night
Hotel Icona (Diamond Beach, New Jersey)
In the backyards of Cape May and The Wildwoods, Hotel Icona Diamond Beach breathes new life into a former 1970s-era hotel.
Its 108 suites accommodate up to six guests -- complete with Frette bedding and granite-and-stainless-steel kitchens.
But the biggest and best amenity is a 425-foot private beach.
Hotel Icona Diamond Beach, 9701 Atlantic Ave., Diamond Beach, New Jersey; +1 609 729 6600; rooms from $180 per night
Montage Kapalua Bay (Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii)
While much of Hawaii's islands are flush with resort-size hotels, Montage Kapalua Bay, on Maui's northwest shore, is an intimate oceanfront hideaway with just 50 suites, ranging from one to four bedrooms.
Cultural classes, catamaran and snorkel cruises are offered by the hotel.
It might just easier to stay back and hang at the 30,000-square-foot Spa Montage.
Access to the 22,000-acre Kapaula Resort area means you never have to leave -- especially with live music nightly and four restaurants.
Montage Kapalua Bay, One Bay Drive, Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii; +1 808 662 6600; rooms from $550 per night
