(CNN)Vince Camuto, the iconic women's footwear designer and co-founder of Nine West, has died. He was 78.
His namesake line paid tribute to the designer with a post on Twitter, citing a quote by Camuto that read, "Life is an adventure. Seize the opportunity and find your passion."
In 1978, Camuto co-founded Nine West with Jerome Fisher. In 1999, they sold what had become one of the country's largest shoe companies to the Jones Group Inc. for nearly $900 million.
Nine West, which has expanded into clothing and accessories, celebrated Camuto's influence on its Facebook page: "Thank you for making women look and feel more beautiful -- from our head to our soles. You will be missed."
Camuto went on to create the Camuto Group in 2001, acquiring licenses for brands like BCBG Max Azria, Lucky Brand and Tory Burch, helping the latter create her now-signature Reva ballet flat.
Under the Camuto Group, he launched three of his own clothing and footwear lines -- Vince Camuto, VC Signature and Louise et Cie -- in 2005.
That year, he purchased the license for the Jessica Simpson Collection.
Simpson mourned the loss of Camuto on Instagram, heralding him as a "mentor" and "the creator of all my dreams."
"I will forever walk in your shoes ... you made them," she continued.
Camuto is survived by his wife, Louise, and five children.
