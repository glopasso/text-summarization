(EW.com) -- Zooey Deschanel is bringing her quirky style to a Macy's near you.
The "New Girl" star has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to create a 16-piece clothing collection called "To Tommy, From Zooey," which is scheduled to arrive in stores this spring.
Items like coats and peek-a-boo print dresses will be priced between $98 and $199.
Several pieces combine '60s mod silhouettes with color-blocking and nautical accents, a look the actress describes as "Modical." According to a release from Hilfiger's press team, the line "captures the buoyant attitude of the sixties, the decade in which Hilfiger made his fashion debut and from which Deschanel borrows her doe-eyed look."
"Working with Tommy on this capsule collection has been really amazing," Deschanel said. "I am a fashion fanatic and I am always looking for new ways to incorporate vintage, feminine pieces into my own wardrobe. Tommy and I share many of the same inspirations â€” old school music, classic films and old Hollywood icons â€” and his guidance during the design process helped to put a really unique twist on each piece."
"Each piece is original and fun," added Hilfiger. "The collection is the perfect fusion of Zooey's adventurous style and the classic, cool, American spirit at the heart of the Tommy Hilfiger brand."
The "To Tommy, From Zooey" line will be sold in over 200 Macy's stores and Tommy Hilfiger outposts in North America, Europe, Mexico and Japan starting April 14th. (A selection of handbags and jewelry will follow later in the month.) The actress will promote the collection by appearing at events in New York, Los Angeles, and Mexico and will also appear in an ad campaign shot by photographer Carter Smith.
