The retrial of Egypt's former president, Hosni Mubarak, on charges of killing protesters during the country's 2011 revolution and profiteering resumed Saturday before being adjourned until next month.
Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests.
Following a lengthy trial, he and his former interior minister, Habib al-Adly, were found guilty and sentenced to life in prison last year on charges that they were complicit in the protesters' killings.
After appealing their convictions, they were granted a new trial early this year.
Six of Mubarak's former security aides last year were acquitted of charges related to the killings, and Mubarak's two sons -- Gamal and Alaa -- were acquitted of corruption charges.
But they, too, were ordered to be retried after President Mohamed Morsy, himself ousted this week, ordered a new investigation last year.
Mubarak and the other defendants have pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Mubarak was present in court Saturday for the fourth session of the retrial, wearing his signature sunglasses. He made his first court appearance in May.
The retrial has been adjourned until August 17, the prosecution said in a statement.
A public prosecutor sent Mubarak -- who spent months detained in a military hospital -- back to prison in April.
Mubarak's health has been a bone of contention during his trial and incarceration. He suffered a heart attack after relinquishing power and had maintained that he was physically unfit to stand trial.
Mubarak has been held since his guilty verdict last year.
He is also charged with seizing public funds and misusing political influence. He also faces a corruption charge that was not part of the original trial. Mubarak is accused of selling natural gas to neighboring Israel for prices below fair market value.
The ousted autocratic leader spent three decades in charge of Egypt, the most populous Arab country.
