A motorcyclist has been charged with pulling a driver from his SUV and beating him in a clash with bikers on a Manhattan roadway that was captured on video, New York authorities said Saturday.
Kaliq Douglas, 27, of Brooklyn, did not enter a plea during his arraignment on allegations of gang assault and assault with intent to cause bodily injury, according to the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.
The case brings to eight the number of people charged in the case, NYPD spokeswoman Annette Markowski said.
Authorities say Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally on September 29. When his SUV was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one.
Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. Lien has not been charged.
The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed. He was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital.
A judge set bond for Douglas at $25,000, according to the district attorney's office.
The NYPD, which has appealed for the public's help in identifying people in photos, hasn't ruled out more arrests or charges.
The beating went viral after a video of the incident was posted online.
Of those arrested, at least three have been indicted by a grand jury. Three NYPD officers are under investigation for allegedly waiting several days to tell their superiors they were at a rally where the SUV driver was beaten and kicked.
