At least five people were killed Saturday in the Yemeni city of Taiz amid heavy shelling and ongoing clashes between government forces and opposition fighters, according to witnesses.
Four of those killed were civilians, said Abdul Haleem Mag'ashi, head of a media outreach committee within the city.
The southwestern city of Taiz has been a scene of recent turmoil where opposition groups have squared off against those loyal to the country's embattled President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
The heaviest clashes took place in the mountain region of Manakha, considered a stronghold for anti-government fighters.
Hundreds of vehicles were left stranded while thousands of residents evacuated the area amid the fighting.
"Many of the casualties go unreported and cannot reach the medical facility," said Yasser Nusari, a medic in Taiz. "Those who do reach come late, resulting in their life being lost."
CNN cannot independently confirm those accounts and the Yemeni government could not be immediately reached for comment.
"With the five killed today, the three-day death toll in Taiz alone is 28 civilians," said Mag'ashi. "All of this after Saleh was granted immunity. We call on the world to help us in our mission for peace."
Saleh recently agreed to step down from power after months of protests against his 33-year rule, becoming the fourth leader to leave office as a result of unrest that has roiled much of the Middle East and North Africa this year.
He had been granted immunity sparking protests among demonstrators who would like to see Saleh tried for alleged acts of violence.
