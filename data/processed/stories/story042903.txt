Geraldo Rivera tweeted over the weekend about Kobani, a key Syrian city that has been a focus in the battle against ISIS. The journalist used his official Twitter account to say "from PR, Kobani is the real Benghazi, the beseiged fortress where president really can & must save heroic defenders."
But while we get that Rivera was enjoying his time in Puerto Rico, it seemed strange that his tweet would include a topless selfie of himself.
It's not like topless selfies haven't stirred the pot for the 71-year-old before. Back in 2013, Rivera blamed it on the alcohol when he tweeted out a nearly nude self-portrait of him draped in a towel and wearing only his glasses.
At the time he said "I never do tequila when I'm alone, but I had this new bottle that someone had given me. The second one, my fate was sealed.
"I said, 'Dammit, I like that picture,'" he added. "I had learned how to use Twitter a couple of weeks ago and there I was."
