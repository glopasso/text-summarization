Aid started flowing into Haiti Wednesday in the wake of the earthquake that slammed the impoverished nation late Tuesday afternoon.
One of two military cargo planes carrying a 30-man assessment team arrived at Port-au-Prince airport Wednesday evening to assess Haiti's needs. One of the team's first jobs is to get the airport working to a point where it can handle flights from around the world filled with people and supplies to help the victims of the quake.
In addition, a unit of U.S. Air Force Special Operations Forces left Hurlburt Field in Florida, with the unit including airmen, search-and-rescue experts and equipment to set up temporary air traffic control systems.
A Canadian military plane was to depart Trenton, Ontario, laden with supplies at 2 a.m. Thursday.
But the air space was not open to charitable organizations, said Franklin Graham, president of Samaritan's purse, which was planning to send charter planes loaded with supplies to Haiti Thursday morning.
"I hope and pray that they will open that air space first thing in the morning," he told CNN.
U.S. Embassy staff at the Port-au-Prince airport said the tower and the lights were working, U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said; a CNN producer said the windows in the tower were broken.
As the scope of the disaster began to come into focus, offers of help began pouring in. Crowley said the Netherlands, Iceland, Puerto Rico, Guyana, Brazil, Canada, Belize, Cuba, Morocco and France all had offered aid. Impact Your World: How you can help
The World Bank promised $100 million in emergency funds for recovery and reconstruction, subject to approval by the World Bank's board of directors.
World Health Organization personnel were planning to depart Thursday morning for Haiti, where their priority was to identify hospitals functional enough to treat the injured and coordinating the international health response.
After relief organizations found themselves tripping over one another following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, they decided to coordinate their efforts with those of non-U.N. organizations in what is called the "U.N. Cluster System."
In the system, WHO plays the lead coordinating role for health; the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or the Red Cross does it for shelter; and the World Food Programme does it for food, according to Christy Feig, WHO's director of communications.
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who in 1975 honeymooned in Haiti with the current secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, urged listeners to donate to http://www.clintonfoundation.org/haitiearthquake/.
"Anybody who sends us money, we're just going to move it into those supplies quickly," he promised.
He urged world leaders who have already made a commitment at a Clinton Foundation donors' conference to check to see whether they had fulfilled it. "Most countries are way behind on fulfilling it," he said. "They (Haitians) need your help now."
He said that, after the 2004 Asian tsunami, Americans donated more than $1 billion, with a median contribution of $56, and half of the money came via the Internet. "Little donations can add up to big amounts," he said. "Five or ten dollars can make a huge difference. These people are just like you and they're hurting now."
Search-and-rescue teams from cities in the United States headed to Haiti, with a team from Fairfax, Virginia, due to arrive Wednesday in Port-au-Prince, the State Department said.
The U.S. Agency for International Development was expected to have an emergency response team on the ground Wednesday, Crowley said.
The United States was also sending aid by ship, and the crew of the USNS Comfort has been ordered to report to the Navy hospital ship. The ship was expected to leave port in Baltimore within five days of receiving its orders, but it had not yet been ordered to deploy, Capt. John Kirby told CNN. It would take about five days to get to Haiti.
The 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck southern Haiti late Tuesday afternoon, knocking down buildings and inflicting destruction and casualties yet to be tallied, given limited communications and emergency services in the Caribbean nation.
