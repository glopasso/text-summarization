Pilots were warned of potential danger at least eight times in about 30 seconds before a Polish jet crashed in Russia in April, killing President Lech Kaczynski and about 100 others.
A transcript that the Polish government released Tuesday shows that an automated warning system sounded the alarm several times before the Tupolev-154 crashed in western Russia.
"Pull up. Pull up," a warning system advised pilots. "Terrain ahead. Terrain ahead."
The April 10 crash killed Kaczynski, his wife, top Polish military officials, the head of Poland's national bank and other dignitaries.
The president had been traveling with a Polish delegation to Russia for the 70th anniversary of the massacre of Polish prisoners of war in the village of Katyn. Some 20,000 Polish officers were executed there during World War II.
