A small plane with four people aboard crashed Monday in a residential neighborhood of Las Vegas, Nevada, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said.
The conditions of the four passengers were not immediately known.
The single-engine Piper Cherokee was unable to gain altitude after taking off from Henderson Executive Airport, just south of Las Vegas, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told CNN.
The pilot tried to return to the airport, but crashed on a street in a neighborhood about two miles northwest of Henderson, Gregor said. The plane hit a few cars upon crashing, according to Stacey Welling, a spokeswoman for Clark County.
The crash occurred about 8:15 a.m. (11:15 a.m. ET).
The plane is registered to a Louisiana resident, but the identities of those aboard were not released.
Investigators from the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are expected to arrive at the scene later Monday, Gregor said.
