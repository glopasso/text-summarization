Sachin Tendulkar's wait for a history-making 100th international century continues after the legendary Indian cricketer fell short again in the first Test against Australia in Melbourne on Tuesday.
The 38-year-old "Little Master" was dismissed for 73 in the final over of the second day as the tourists reached 214-3 in reply to Australia's first-innings total of 333.
Tendulkar is international cricket's record run scorer in both the five-day and limited overs formats but has been stranded on 99 centuries since March.
He added 117 with Rahul Dravid after coming to the crease at 97-2, following opening batsman Virender Sehwag's quickfire 67 off 83 balls. Sehwag passed 8,000 runs in Tests as he registered his 31st half-century.
Australia lose late wickets against India
Tendulkar continued the brisk pace, as he hit eight fours and a six from 98 deliveries faced, reaching his 64th Test half-century before being bowled by Peter Siddle.
Dravid was unbeaten on a patient 65 off 185 balls, with the 38-year-old notching his 63rd Test fifty, while Ishant Sharma successfully negotiated the final three balls of the day to leave India 119 runs behind Australia with seven wickets remaining.
Dravid is the second-highest Test run scorer of all time behind Tendulkar on 13,162, having extended his margin over Australia's Ricky Ponting (12,718).
India, seeking a first series victory in Australia in 64 years in the four-match competition, lost an early wicket when Gautam Gambhir was caught by wicketkeeper Brad Haddin off the bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus for just three runs with the score at 22.
Australia had resumed on 277-6, with Haddin on 21 and Siddle unbeaten on 34.
Both fell to Zaheer Khan with the addition of only 14 runs as Haddin was caught by Sehwag for 27 and Siddle by wicketkeeper captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni for 41.
Left-arm fast bowler Khan ended with figures of 4-77 off 31 overs, while off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin took the last two wickets to fall to finish with 3-81.
Ashwin said the Indians were not concerned by Tendulkar's failure to reach the coveted landmark.
"It's going to eventually happen, no point in bothering about it. We're very happy to be in the position we are presently," the 25-year-old told reporters.

Sri Lanka lost captain Tillekeratne Dilshan, dismissed by Dale Steyn, to be seven for one when bad light drew proceedings on the second day to an early close.
Welegedera had all his victims caught behind or in the slips and was superbly backed up by left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who four for 49.
