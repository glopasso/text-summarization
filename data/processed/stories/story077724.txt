The Israel Defense Forces called off a raid after one of its combat soldiers posted information about the operation, including the time and place, on Facebook, the IDF said Wednesday.
"On Wednesday, we are cleaning up (the village). Today - arrest. On Thursday, God willing, we will be home," the soldier, who was not identified, posted on the social networking site, according to IDF.
The post was removed after other soldiers in the company saw it online and reported it to their commanders, IDF said.
"The division commander decided to cancel the operation out of concern that the information had reached hostile groups and would harm IDF forces," it said.
The soldier was sentenced to 10 days imprisonment and was removed from his battalion and all combat postings, IDF said. His combat certificate also was revoked.
IDF soldiers are prohibited from posting classified information online, including photographs of military interests.
