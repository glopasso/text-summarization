Guinea equaled the record for a winning margin in an Africa Cup of Nations match on Saturday with a 6-1 over 10-man Botswana in Franceville.
Sadio Diallo opened the scoring in the 15th minute when he coverted a Abdoul Camara cross.
Dipsy Selolwane equalized for Botswana scoring at the second attempt from a penalty in the 23rd minute after Jerome Ramatlhakwana was brought down by Guinea goalkeeper Naby Yattara.
But parity didn't last long as Diallo scored his second four minutes later to put Guinea back in front.
Camara extended the lead in the 42nd minute and Ibrahima Traore made it 4-1 in first half injury time.
The Stuttgart winger scored from a free kick which saw Botswana substitute Patrick Motsepe sent off for a foul on Feindouno.
Guinea saw more chances come and go in the second half before Mamadou Bah made it 5-1 in the 84th minute with Naby Soumah completing the rout two minutes later.
In Group D's other match, Ghana beat Mali 2-0.
Asamoah Gyan opened the scoring from a free kick in the 63rd minute with Ayew doubling the Black Stars' lead 13 minutes later.
Saturday's results means the 2010 World Cup quarter-finalists sit at the top of the group with six points from their two games while Guinea and Mali both have three points.
Although bottom-placed Botswana have no points they still have a mathematical chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.
All will be decided on Wednesday February 1 when Mali take on Botswana in Libreville and Ghana face Guinea in Franceville.
