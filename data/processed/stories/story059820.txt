The U.N. high commissioner for refugees announced an inter-agency appeal Wednesday for $280 million to support Iraqi refugees.
The Regional Response Plan for Iraqi Refugees includes the plans of 40 international organizations and non-governmental organizations supporting Iraqi refugees in 12 countries, including Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and the six Gulf states, according to a statement from Antonio Guterres' office.
"I appeal to donor governments to recognize the critical needs of Iraqi refugees, particularly those who are becoming more vulnerable by the day," the high commissioner said in the statement.
The U.N. refugee agency said more than 190,000 Iraqi refugees are registered in the region, with the majority living in Syria and Jordan.
Many have struggled to find employment, and some Iraqi refugee children have dropped out of school to find casual work to help feed their families, the agency said.
The high commissioner's office also noted thousands of refugees suffer from critical health conditions.
"The burden on host communities and host governments in the region is enormous," Guterres said. "It is essential that the international community support humanitarian efforts to help the most vulnerable refugees."
