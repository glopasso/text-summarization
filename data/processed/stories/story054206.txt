(EW.com) -- So long, Reege.
At least, that's what fans of "Live! With Regis and Kelly" will be saying when the 80-year-old co-host tapes his last episode of the syndicated talk show on Friday, November 18.
Philbin made the announcement during today's show. "Friday, November 18 is my last day," Philbin said, adding, "But don't worry, the show goes on."
Back in January, the television icon officially announced that he would be stepping down from "Live!" after co-hosting for nearly 28 years.
Philbin said of his retirement from the show at the time, "There is a time that everything must come to an end for certain people on camera, especially certain old people." The Emmy-winner joked on Tuesday, "Last January I made the announcement that I'll be moving on. But I never gave you an exact date. So I'm pushing it back five years. Just kidding."
While no new co-host has yet been named for Philbin's right-hand woman Kelly Ripa (we here at EW had some suggestions of our own, however), the two discussed finding a replacement. "Kelly will be trying out new co-hosts, just like we did 11 years ago when we found her," Philbin said, kidding that Ripa would be looking for a "new young hot" male co-host.
Ripa, who joined Philbin in 2001 after Kathie Lee Gifford exited, fired back by saying that she was just looking for someone, "Alive and breathing."
