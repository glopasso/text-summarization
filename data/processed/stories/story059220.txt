Motorsport's ruling body has officially approved a host of Formula One team name changes for the 2012 season.
Team Lotus, Lotus Renault and Virgin were all given permission to alter their names following a meeting of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile's F1 commission in Geneva last week.
CNN-sponsored Lotus will now be known as Caterham F1 from next year onwards, while Virgin will be renamed Marussia F1.
Russian carmaker Marussia Motors purchased a significant stake in Virgin in November 2010, and has had its logo present on the car throughout the 2011 season.
Renault will also undergo changes ahead of next year's campaign, changing the team's chassis name to Lotus.
The announcements mark the end of a two-year spell which has seen two teams race using the legendary name.
"We are very pleased that our chassis name change has been approved," team principal Eric Boullier told Renault's official website.
"We have said all along that, in the interests of the sport, it is important that we remove any ambiguity on this matter. It is also important that there are clearly identifiable teams on the grid.
"It is the start of another chapter for Enstone (the team's HQ), but not a whole new beginning. The team's history and experience will allow us to take up this challenge with a controlled and swift process. We're very much looking forward to 2012."
Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel has already retained the 2011 world drivers' championship, with the Britain-based Austrian team having also clinched the constructors' title for the second year in a row.
The penultimate race of the campaign is on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, before the season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix on November 27.
