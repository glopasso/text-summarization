Chinese authorities in eastern Jiangsu Province have launched a massive manhunt for a suspect in a deadly armed robbery, according to Chinese media.
The suspect allegedly shot and killed a man who had just withdrawn 200,000 yuan ($31,700) from a bank in Nanjing's Dongmen Street on January 6 and then fled the scene in a car, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
Nanjing Public Security Bureau's Xuanwu district office told CNN that more than 80,000 police have joined the manhunt, while a reward of 150,000 yuan has been offered for information leading to the killer's arrest.
Authorities believe the suspect -- a man in his early 40s from Sichuan province called Zeng Kaigui -- is also responsible for shooting dead six others in six robberies in Changsha and Chongqing municipality over the past seven years.
Nanjing police have obtained two video clips of the suspect escaping the scene and published them online, and said Zeng is of medium build and wears black outfits during the robbery.
Police have posted Zeng's profile picture in public places like subway stations and Internet cafes, and have handed them out to taxi and bus drivers throughout the c
Many big screens in downtown Nanjing are also showing the suspect's video clips hourly with police warnings to citizens.
