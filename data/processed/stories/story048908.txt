Anna Fenninger believes the best is yet to come after winning the World Cup giant slalom in front of her home fans at Semmering.
The Austria star produced the fastest time in both the first and second run to see off championship leader Tina Maza and France's Tess Worley.
Just over a year since Fenninger's maiden World Cup triumph at Lienz, the Super-Combined World champion recorded an aggregate time of 2:13.09 to top the charts.

And with another win under her belt, the 23-year-old is determined to build on her success.
"My goal now is to keep skiing at that level until the Worlds' and we'll see what is going to happen there", she told reporters.
"When I won last year, I was really surprised. Winning today gives me the confidence that I can do it again and hopefully very soon.
"I felt good out there today and I was 100 percent sure of my skiing.
"Thats what you need to have to win such a race. On the upper part of the piste I got it right by just letting my skies do the work.
"The lead I had after the first run was very important."

Meanwhile, World Cup leader Tina Maze expressed her delight after claiming her first ever podium at Semmering
"I'm very happy with the 2nd place, although my 1st run wasn't perfect," she told reporters.
"I lost a lot of time in the top part. I'm pretty constant and very pleased with the way I've been skiing. One can't win every time.
"Others also have their perfect day. I will now stay focused on my goals of the season, which are the Worlds' and the overall."
Championship leader Maze's second place secured a ninth podium spot of the season, taking her overall points for the season to 999.
