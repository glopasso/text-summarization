(Mashable) -- Google has topped a list of the most reputable companies in the U.S., according to a Harris Interactive poll.
Harris Interactive asked more than 30,000 respondents to identify the 60 most visible companies in the U.S. and rate them based on 20 different attributes, including financial performance, emotional appearance, social responsibility and leadership.
Technology companies dominated the top of the list. At number one is Google, which Harris Interactive rates at an 84.05/100 on the reputation scale (80.0 and higher is consider "excellent").
Other notable tech companies making the top of the list were Apple (No. 5), Intel (No. 6), Amazon (No. 8), Sony (No. 14) and Microsoft (No. 16), all of whom received a rating higher than 80.
Rounding out the bottom of the list were insurance conglomerates, banks, and oil companies. AIG received the worst reputation ranking with a 47.77. BP, the company responsible for the worst oil spill in history, had the second-worst ranking.
Other companies that made the bottom tier of Harris Interactive's list include Comcast, Delta Airlines, JPMorgan Chase, ExxonMobile, General Motors, Bank of America, Chrysler, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.
Despite government investigations and privacy concerns, the world's largest search engine still enjoys a supremely positive image in the eyes of its millions of users.
