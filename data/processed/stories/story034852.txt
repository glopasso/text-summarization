Before "The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I" arrives in theaters, we're getting one last look at what's sure to be a blockbuster.
The final trailer for the "Mockingjay -- Part I" was released Wednesday, and it has fans on fire for November 21.
Whereas earlier clips have given us a sense of the scope of the Districts' battle with The Capitol, the final trailer raises the stakes. This time, the emphasis is on the specific threats being lobbed at Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss Everdeen.
"They're coming Katniss," a tearful Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) warns her at one point in the clip. "They're going to kill everyone. You'll be dead by morning."
President Snow (Donald Sutherland) sends Katniss a threat of his own, telling her to "prepare to pay the ultimate price." But it's Katniss' response that gives us chills.
"I have a message for President Snow," Lawrence's heroine says. "If we burn, you burn with us!"
"The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I," the third film in the "Hunger Games" saga based on Suzanne Collins' trilogy, will arrive on November 21. The fourth and final "Hunger Games" film will arrive November 20, 2015.
