Veteran sports broadcaster Jim Huber, a former CNN journalist, died Monday at the age of 67. He was recently diagnosed with acute leukemia.
Huber, who spent more than 27 years with Turner Broadcasting, most recently worked for Turner Sports' TNT network, covering golf and the NBA.
"We are saddened by the passing of our colleague and friend Jim Huber," said David Levy, president of sales, distribution and sports for Turner Broadcasting.
Before his move to Turner Sports, Huber was an anchor for CNN/Sports Illustrated, a 24-hour sports news network.
Huber started at CNN in 1984 but began his career in print journalism, covering the NFL at the Miami News, followed by The Atlanta Journal, where he covered the city's professional football and basketball teams.
He was also the author of three books, the most recent published in May. "Four Days in July" follows pro-golfer Tom Watson's improbable run at the 2009 British Open title.

Watson, just shy of his 60th birthday at the time, was eventually beaten in a playoff by fellow American Stewart Cink.
Huber's reporting garnered a number of awards, including an Emmy for his "Olympic Park Bombing" essay and six Sportscaster of the Year awards from The Associated Press.
"Jim's award-winning talent to write, host and moderate was well known -- but his passion for golf, playing, watching and promoting golf was something that the PGA of America and PGA.com will always hold near and dear," PGA.com's John Kim wrote Monday. Huber wrote a weekly column for the Turner Sports website.
Levy called Huber "a gentleman and a wonderful individual," and said he "will be deeply missed."
Huber is survived by his wife, Carol, and son, Matt.
