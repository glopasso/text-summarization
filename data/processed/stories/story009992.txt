Former FBI Director Louis Freeh was seriously injured and hospitalized after a single-vehicle accident in Vermont, state police said.
Vermont State Police said Tuesday that Freeh was still hospitalized and being treated for his injuries. There was no update on his condition. Police also said that neither alcohol nor drugs were a factor in Monday's accident.
Freeh, 64, was wearing his seat belt when the GMC Yukon he was driving went off the road near Barnard, struck a mailbox and ran over some bushes, police said. Police found his SUV next to a tree.
He was taken by helicopter to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. The hospital would not release information on Freeh's condition.
No one else was injured in the wreck, which was reported just after noon, the state police said.
Freeh was director of the FBI from September 1993 to June 2001.
"The thoughts and prayers of the entire FBI remain with former Director Freeh and his family tonight," FBI Director James Comey said Monday.
