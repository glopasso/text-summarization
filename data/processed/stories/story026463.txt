It was 35 years ago Tuesday that Sony, not Apple, revolutionized the way we listen to music.
The Walkman, a portable cassette player that, for the first time, let us take our music with us without bothering our neighbors, hit the market on July 1, 1979.
Today, it's all about Apple's iPod. But in its heyday, the Walkman was as synonymous with portable music players as Kleenex became to tissue and Xerox was to copy machines.
Bowing to digital reality, Sony retired the cassette Walkman in 2010.
