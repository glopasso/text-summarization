The two women shot and wounded by Los Angeles police during the manhunt for renegade ex-officer Christopher Dorner are "not doing well," their attorney said Thursday at a news conference to announce a resolution to the loss of their bullet-riddled pickup truck.
Margie Carranza, 47, and her mother, Emma Hernandez, 71, will receive $40,000 to replace the truck, Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich said.
Carranza and Hernandez were shot as police searched for Dorner, a former police officer who was wanted for killing several people in early February.

The two women were in a truck similar to the one authorities said Dorner was driving.
"They're not doing well," attorney Glen Jonas said. "Margie is still very emotionally impacted by what happened. Emma is suffering as far as her injuries are concerned."
Hernandez was shot twice in the back, and Carranza suffered injuries from broken glass, CNN affiliate KTLA reported.
Trutanich told reporters that now that the issues with the truck are settled, lawyers can turn their attention to the personal injury issues.
The lawyers said they had to find a creative solution to get the women a new truck because of tax laws. Essentially the $40,000 is for the value of the truck, Jonas' fees, compensation for the time the women have gone without a truck and other matters.
Jonas waived his fees, which would have amounted to about $25,000, he said.
"We wanted to get this issue resolved because it is draining a lot of energy," Jonas said.
He would not comment on how much the women will seek in compensation for their physical injuries and emotional distress.
Dorner died February 12 while holed up in a cabin that caught fire when police fired tear gas canisters into it. Days before, he had killed four people and wounded three others as part of a vendetta against his former comrades before apparently taking his own life in the cabin.
