(EW.com) -- While "The Wolverine" is currently in theaters, rumors popped up online this week that star Hugh Jackman was being courted to sign a deal worth $100 million for four more movies featuring the clawed mutant.
But EW caught up with Jackman on the Montreal set of next summer's highly anticipated "X-Men: Days of Future Past" and the actor laughed off the reports.
"No it's not true," says Jackman. "I would never do that. I've never done that mainly because, for the fans and for me, each time I've gone around there's been a really good reason to do it and I don't know what that reason is from here. I'm in the middle of making this and I just promoted the other and I'm really happy with the way The Wolverine came out."
"X-Men: Days of Future Past" is due in theaters May 23, 2014.
