Gennaro Gattuso has ended speculation over his future by signing a new AC Milan contract, the Serie A club have announced.
Gattuso has been linked with moves to the English Premier League in recent weeks as he was said to be unhappy with his first-team opportunities after battling injury.
But the club have confirmed he will be remaining in Milan for the next three years.
"Milan announce that Rino Gattuso has extended his contract with the club until 30 June 2012," said a statement on the club's official Web site.
Gattuso, who turns 32 next month, has spent the last decade with Milan after spells with Perugia, Glasgow giants Rangers and Salernitana early in his career.
He also has 70 caps for Italy and was a member of the World Cup-winning squad in 2006.
