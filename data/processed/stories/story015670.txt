Miranda Kerr is one of Victoria's Secret's most recognizable models, but rumors spread Wednesday that the company had stripped her of her Angel wings.
Victoria's Secret denied the gossip, saying in a statement to CNN that it intends to keep working with her.
The reports suggested that the lingerie and clothing brand had decided not to renew Kerr's reported $1 million contract. People magazine and Us Weekly quoted chatty inside sources who claimed that Kerr has "a difficult reputation" and "wasn't very timely."
However, an anonymous source told People that if Kerr were to cease working with Victoria's Secret, the reason wouldn't be because of any behavioral issues.
"It's purely contractual. She'll be coming back for the show, but it's unclear if she'll be in future campaigns," the source said.
The president and chief marketing officer of Victoria's Secret, Ed Razek, doesn't seem to have a problem with the model and mom of one. He called Kerr, who welcomed son Flynn with husband Orlando Bloom in January 2011, "one of the best models in the history of the business -- and easily one of the most popular."
Additionally, Razek continued, "She is also a consummate professional. Any rumors to the contrary are simply untrue. While her international commitments have kept her away from us more than we'd like over the past few years, she will always be an Angel to me."
The company, he said, has "no plans to stop working with her. In fact, I've already invited her to walk the runway in this year's fashion show and, happily, she's agreed."
