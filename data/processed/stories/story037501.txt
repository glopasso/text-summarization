The Baltimore Ravens' top security guy has been charged with a sex offense that allegedly occurred December 14, online court records reveal.
The senior security director for the NFL team, Darren Sanders, was charged with a fourth-degree sex offense which is "not considered a sexually violent offense but sexual contact without consent of victim," according to the Maryland Attorney General's office definition.
The record did not go into details about the charges but the address listed for the defendant is that of the team's headquarters in Owings Mills, Maryland.
CNN was unable to reach Sanders' lawyer. But the lawyer, Andrew Alperstein, told the Baltimore Sun the charges were "totally fabricated."
Earlier this year, Sanders was mired in the infamous Ray Rice elevator beating scandal in which the football player was investigated for hitting his then-fiancée in an elevator of a New Jersey casino.
Sanders played a role in explaining how he, on the team's behalf, requested the casino's video footage of Janay Palmer being beaten in the elevator.
He said the casino officer would only describe the video to him, and he relayed the information to Ravens executives.
Sanders was publicly scrutinized for his lack of investigative effort when the media outlet, TMZ, obtained and released the video footage.
Sanders' court date is scheduled for February 9 in Maryland.
