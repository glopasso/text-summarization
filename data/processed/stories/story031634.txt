Inter Milan came from behind to defeat Juventus 2-1 in Thursday's Italian Cup quarterfinal, increasing the pressure on Juve coach Ciro Ferrara.
Diego's 10th-minute strike looked to have set the Bianconeri on their way to a much-needed victory at the San Siro.
But Lucio levelled after 72 minutes and Mario Balotelli grabbed a last-gasp winner for Inter to secure a two-legged last-four date with Fiorentina next month.
Ferrara's side came into the match on the back of five defeats in six Serie A games and lying sixth in the table -- a mammoth 16 points adrift of leaders Inter.
But, despite their poor recent run, the visitors started well and broke the deadlock after just 10 minutes.
Diego cut inside Esteban Cambiasso and lashed a low shot through the legs of Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo.
But Inter fought back after the break and levelled 18 minutes from time when goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon was left wrong-footed when Wes Sneijder's free-kick took a wicked deflection -- and Lucio nipped in at the far post to prod home the equalizer.
And Buffon was powerless to prevent Inter's winner at the death, keeping out Thiago Motta's initial effort but unable to prevent Balotelli to net the rebound.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Getafe reached the Copa del Rey semifinals despite losing 1-0 at home to Real Mallorca.
Aritz Aduritz made up for an earlier penalty miss with a 45th-minute headed goal to level the aggregate score 2-2.
But Getafe's two away goals from the first leg 2-1 proved enough to send the Madrid side through to face Sevilla in a repeat of the 2007 cup final.
