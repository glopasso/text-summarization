Actress Sandra Bullock was inside her Los Angeles home when a man allegedly tried to break in Sunday, police said.
Joshua James Corbett, 39, was arrested outside the residence by police responding to a "hot prowler" call at 6:30 a.m., according to a Los Angeles Police spokeswoman.
Corbett was charged with felony residential burglary and was being held in a Los Angeles jail on $50,000 bond, LAPD Officer Wendy Reyes said Monday.
Bullock, who also has a home in Texas, was in Los Angeles over the weekend to receive the "Decade of Hotness Award" at the Guys Choice Awards.
Her west Los Angeles home is surrounded by a chain-linked fence topped with barbed wire.
No court date has been set for Corbett, but if he gets out he must stay away from the "Gravity" star.
Bullock's representatives did not respond to CNN requests for comment.
Police did not release any additional information about Corbett, and CNN has been unable to identify a lawyer for him.
CNN has confirmed through FAA records that Corbett has a private pilot's license.
CNN's Joan Yeam contributed to this report.
