Mario Chalmers starred in a 103-84 win for the Miami Heat in Game Two of the 2013 NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, leveling the series.
The Heat trailed by one point late in the third quarter but bounced back to seal a franchise-record 66th win of the season at Miami's American Airlines Arena.
Chalmers finished with 19 points, while LeBron James contributed 17 points, eight rebounds, seven assists, three steals and three blocks.
San Antonio's star man Tony Parker scored 13 points, with the Spurs missing the precision displayed during Thurday's 92-88 victory in Game One.
Tuesday's Game Three sees the series switch to San Antonio's AT & T Center, where it will stay until Game Six.
