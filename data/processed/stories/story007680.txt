Lexi Thompson struggled to describe her delight after she won the Navistar LPGA Classic on Sunday to become the female golf tour's youngest-ever winner.
Thompson's five-shot triumph at the Robert Trent Jones Trail's Capitol Hill Senator Course -- aged 16 year, seven months and eight days -- beat the record previously held by her fellow American Marlene Hagge.
"It feels amazing," Thompson told the Tour's official website. "I can't even describe it. It's been my dream my whole life just to play out here. Getting a win right now, I can't describe the feelings, but it's the best feeling ever."
The Florida resident, who became the youngest player to qualify for the women's U.S. Open in 2007 at the age of 12, finished 17-under-par after carding a final round of 70 to beat off competition from compatriot Tiffany Joh.
Thompson was accompanied on the course by her father and caddy Scott, and the world number 124 said it was an emotional experience to walk up the final fairway with her Dad.
"I loved it," she said. "Just being there with my Dad, he was like, 'Lexi, just enjoy that walk. I am going off to the side because I might cry.'
"You know, I definitely cried after I finished. Just finishing that with my dad on the bag, it was the best experience. I wouldn't be out here without my Dad and my Mom, of course."
Thompson received a check for $195,000 for her historic win, and the youngster pledged to donate $20,000 to the Wounded Warrior Project -- the tournament's official charity, which helps wounded members of the Armed Forces.
"Well, I think they deserve it," said Thompson. "They give up their lives for us, you know, saving our country. I wore the pin every day.
"Donating to them, just you have to. I mean, look what they do for us. It's just amazing that they do that. I definitely want to give back."
Angela Stanford finished in third position, one shot back from Joh, with the U.S.'s Brittany Lang and Karen Stupples of England tied for fourth position on 10-under.
