English Premier League side Liverpool are waiting to find out the extent of the injury suffered by Spain striker Fernando Torres during the closing stages of the World Cup final.
The 26-year-old, a late substitute in Spain's 1-0 extra-time victory over the Netherlands, pulled up as he chased a long ball, before collapsing to the ground and thumping his fist on the ground.
He recovered enough to play a part in Spain's celebrations and returned to Madrid on Monday with his victorious team-mates.
A statement on Liverpool's website confirmed the injury as a left adductor problem, although the severity is not yet known.
Torres endured an injury-disrupted season with Liverpool, and came into the World Cup after a six week layoff following his second knee operation.
He has been linked with a big-money move away from the Reds, who slumped to a disappointing seventh-place finish last season.
But in a separate item, Liverpool's website featured pictures of Torres holding the World Cup while wearing the team's scarf, an image that may reassure fans desperate to keep hold of one of their prize assets.
Meanwhile, Manchester United departed for their pre-season tour of the United States without a number of their best-known players.
Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Nemanja Vidic have all been left at home to recover from the World Cup, while Gary Neville, Michael Owen, Antonio Valencia, Anderson and Owen Hargreaves are all recovering from injuries.
However, new signings Chris Smalling and Javier Hernandez are making the trip.
Elsewhere, Sunderland manager Steve Bruce says he wants to sign defender Sol Campbell from Arsenal, and Portsmouth manager Steve Cotterill has revealed that Nigeria striker John Utaka is set to leave the club following their relegation to the Championship.
