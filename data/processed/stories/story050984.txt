"I can't breathe" has become a new slogan in protests against alleged police brutality after a grand jury declined to indict a police officer in the death of Eric Garner.
Garner said it eight times while restrained on the ground by several officers.  Police say Garner resisted arrest and video shows him asking  police not to harass or touch him after they confronted him on a sidewalk.
Here's a transcript of his last words:
"Get away [garbled] ... for what? Every time you see me, you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today. Why would you...? Everyone standing here will tell you I didn't do nothing. I did not sell nothing. Because every time you see me, you want to harass me. You want to stop me (garbled) Selling cigarettes. I'm minding my business, officer, I'm minding my business. Please just leave me alone. I told you the last time, please just leave me alone. please please, don't touch me. Do not touch me."
Video of the arrest shows four officers wrestling Garner to the ground and restraining him.
" I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe. I can't breathe," he said, as officers restrained him.
