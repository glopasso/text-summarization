Miss Independent now has her own Little Miss on her hands.
Pop music star Kelly Clarkson announced the birth of her daughter, River Rose Blackstock, Saturday on Twitter.
"Thank you everyone for all of your well wishes!" she wrote. "Brandon and I are on cloud 9!! :)."
River Rose is the first child for Clarkson, who first shot to fame in 2002 by winning the inaugural season of the hit music talent show "American Idol." Her mom has gone on to become one of the country's most recognizable and renowned singers, who has hits including "Stronger" and "Since U Been Gone."
Clarkson married Blackstock, a talent manager and father of two, in October.
Clarkson didn't divulge details about the couple's new child together, besides the fact that the baby was born on Thursday, June 12.
