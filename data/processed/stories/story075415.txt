A Romanian princess and her husband are scheduled to appear in court Friday after they were arrested in an alleged cockfighting ring in Oregon.
John Wesley Walker and his wife, Princess Irina Walker, the third daughter of Romania's exiled King Michael I, are among six people charged with operating an illegal gambling business, the Justice Department said in a statement.
Those six are also charged, along with 12 others, with conspiracy to violate the animal Welfare Act by conducting unlawful animal fighting ventures on 10 occasions, the statement said.
The arrests took place Thursday across various sites in Oregon and Washington. The Walkers are from Irrigon, in Morrow County, Oregon, according to the indictment.
They and the others arrested in Oregon are scheduled to appear for arraignment before a federal magistrate judge in Portland on Friday afternoon.
Each of the offenses carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000, according to the Justice Department.
It was unclear whether the couple has a lawyer.
