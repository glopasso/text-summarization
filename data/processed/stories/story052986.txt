A New Orleans police officer was suspended Monday without pay after he posted remarks online about slain Florida teen Trayvon Martin.
"Act like a Thug Die like one!" officer Jason Giroir wrote on the website of CNN affiliate WWL, under a news story on the case that has sparked national debate and concerns about racial profiling.
Giroir admitted to the post, according to a statement from New Orleans police.
"The Internet comments written by Officer Giroir, which include the fact that he is member of the NOPD, have given me grave concern regarding his fitness for duty. Because of this, I have suspended Giroir without pay, effective immediately," Superintendent Ronal Serpas said in the statement.

"To say that I'm angry is an understatement. I'm furious," he added. Serpas said Giroir embarrassed the department by his "insensitive, harmful and offensive comments."
Trayvon Martin, 17, was killed late last month as he walked back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida, after a trip to a convenience store. Police say he was unarmed, carrying a bag of Skittles candy and an iced tea. He was shot by George Zimmerman, who said he was acting in self-defense, according to authorities.
