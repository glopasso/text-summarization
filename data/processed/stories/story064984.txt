Two female suicide bombers blew themselves up at a bustling market in northern Nigeria this week, killing 78 people and leaving dozens injured, medical officials said.
The blast in Maiduguri on Tuesday left 56 people injured.  A doctor and a nurse at two local hospitals confirmed the casualties, but they did not want to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
One suicide bomber detonated  her explosives at the market while a second one set off hers when rescuers arrived at the scene.
No group has claimed responsibility.
Authorities suspect Islamic militant group Boko Haram, which has seized parts of the region and is known to conduct such attacks.
The radical group has carried out deadly attacks in the nation during its five-year insurgency aimed at establishing an Islamic state‎.
