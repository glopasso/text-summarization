Strong storms and heavy rain hampered travel from North Carolina to Maine on Tuesday.
It was difficult to find an on-time flight out of the Northeast as some major airports had arrival delays of more than four hours.
At one point, LaGuardia Airport had a delay of almost five hours.
The fight tracking website FlightAware.com said more than 4,600 flights originating in or flying to the United States had been delayed for various reasons, including weather. There were more than 1,200 cancellations.
The National Weather's Storm Prediction Center told the millions of Americans along the East Coast to expect storms capable of producing damaging wind gusts.
The bad weather wasn't just there. Forecasters said tornadoes were possible in Colorado and Wyoming.
There were also flash flood warnings in at least 10 states as storms passed through.
In Voorhees, New Jersey, one resident said it felt like a tornado had hit.
"There was lightning striking all around us. Everywhere," Sarah Lindauer told CNN affiliate KYW.
At least 10 homes in the South Jersey town were damaged, but there were no immediate reports of injury and the weather service blamed the destruction on a severe thunderstorm, not a tornado.
Melissa Calkins, an iReporter from Bergen, New Jersey, said it only rained for a few minutes, but when it did, the sky really opened up.
She was out walking dogs when the storm hit. She got them in the car and headed to their owner in West New York, New Jersey, about four miles from where she was.
"I was shocked to reach higher ground and still reach a flooded path," she said. "I had to find an alternate route."
But not before snapping a picture that showed clearing skies, but water that almost covered the tires of four cars.
