Tunnels under the U.S.-Mexico border are nothing new, but authorities spotted two smugglers taking a different approach this week: driving a Jeep over the 14-foot fence dividing the two countries.
But the makeshift ramp the suspects propped up at the border near Yuma, Arizona, didn't work, officials said.
U.S. Border Patrol agents patrolling the area saw the Jeep get stuck. It was left wedged atop the fence, and its drivers fled into Mexico, the patrol said in a statement. It was not immediately clear what the vehicle may have been carrying.
"Suspects attempting to drive a vehicle over the border fence fell prey to their own devices," the statement said.
Border Patrol agents confiscated the vehicle and the makeshift ramp.
