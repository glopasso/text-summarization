A day after North Korea test-fired two missiles, South Korea captured a fishing boat from the North that had crossed into South Korean waters, officials say.
The boat crossed the sea demarcation line that separates the two Koreas and was captured by the South Korean navy Thursday, the South Korean Ministry of Defense said.
The action comes as tensions between the two Koreas are rising once again.
On Wednesday, North Korea tested two medium-range ballistic missiles, firing them into the ocean.
South Korea says it believes the missile tests are a reaction to ongoing U.S.-South Korean military drills.
North Korea had harsh words for the South, accusing it of provocations.
"The puppet military gangsters perpetrated such provocations as firing bullets and shells from the areas around the five islands including Paekryong and Big Yonphyong islands and scattering leaflets hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK on March 24," the North Korean news agency KCNA reported.
