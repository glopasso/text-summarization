The sister of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects has pleaded not guilty to possession of marijuana, according to her attorney.
Bella Tsarnaev entered the plea at her arraignment hearing Tuesday to the initial charge of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, Tsarnaev's attorney, Mario Blanch told CNN.
Police originally arrested Tsarnaev in December 2012 after responding to a domestic disturbance call and finding marijuana in her Fairview, New Jersey, apartment.
Blanch says Tsarnaev, 24, has no prior criminal record, and he is hoping she will be accepted into New Jersey's pretrial intervention program, in which mostly first-time offenders are offered alternatives to the normal prosecution process. No court dates have been set yet.
Blanch added that his client has no involvement in the Boston bombing incidents.
"I think she found out about her brothers the way the rest of the country did -- on the news."

Tsarnaev's younger brother Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is currently being held in federal prison and has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. Her older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a shootout with Boston police days after the bombings.
One victim of the April 15 attack remains hospitalized. Three people were killed and at least 264 injured in the two bombings near the finish line of the marathon.
