(CNN)Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson had a way better weekend than you.
The actor hosted "Saturday Night Live" and rocked out in some memorable sketches, including a live-action "Bambi" remake with some of the "SNL" cast portraying actors from the "Fast and Furious" franchise.
"Whan I was a boy, they took away my mother," Johnson said in character as a muscle-bound, gun-wielding Bambi. "And now it's time for them to pay ... dearly."
He also transformed, Hulk-style, into "The Rock Obama" in a sketch in which President Obama is angered by some members of Congress.
The former professional wrestler spoofed the WWE in a promo on "SNL."
But that was just a warmup to the actual Wrestlemania 31 on Sunday, when the Rock thrilled fans with a surprise appearance with UFC champion Ronda Rousey to take on WWE executives Stephanie McMahon and Triple H.
The actor is the son of retired professional wrestler Rocky Johnson and wrestled under the name "The Rock" for years before he transitioned to an acting career.
