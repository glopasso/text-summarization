Tropical Storm Ester continued to intensify after sweeping across the Philippines over the weekend, leaving at least one person dead and 15 others missing, authorities said.
A 17-member crew on board a freighter was hit by the storm -- also known as Typhoon Dianmu -- and 14 of the members were still missing Monday, according to the Phillippines National Disaster Coordinating Council. Three of the 17 were located -- one dead, and two others alive.
A 13-year-old boy was also reported missing after being swept away by a strong current while swimming in the Santa Clara River, the disaster council said.
More than 200 families from a community in the northern province of Bulacan were evacuated Sunday, and nearly 150 of them were still housed in shelters Monday, the council said.
The storm was expected to strengthen as it headed to China and complicate the response to flooding cause by heavy rains in recent weeks, according to the country's national meteorological agency.
Ester was expected to approach the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula on Tuesday before making it's way to northeast China, state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing the meteorological agency.
