"Mad Men" showrunner Matthew Weiner has always been a stickler for detail, but his latest bid for period accuracy is pretty stringent even by his own high standards.
Weiner is changing a song used in the upcoming fifth season premiere after critics who received early copies of the episode pointed out an apparent oversight: The track, Dusty Springfield's 1967 tune "The Look of Love," wasn't released until six months after the episode takes place.
The writer-producer will use a different song instead. He sent this explanatory note to critics, which also doesn't exactly hurt your relationship with the press:
"Dear Journalist:
As you know, one of the things I love best about 'Mad Men' is the passionate response I get from members of the press. Recently a few of you have mentioned that the song "The Look of Love," used in our season five premiere episode, was not actually released until six months after the episode takes place.
Because of this we have replaced this song with one more suited to the time period and you, along with our audience, will hear it for the first time during our March 25th broadcast.
Although we take license for artistic purposes with the end-title music, we never want the source music to break from the time period we are trying to recreate.
As someone who has a deep appreciation for details, I want to thank you for bringing this to our attention.  It's a privilege to work on a show that generates an ongoing dialog with you and our amazing fans so please -- keep those notes and comments coming!
All the best,
Matthew Weiner"
Depending how much time is covered this season, maybe they can use the song in the fifth season finale instead?
