Cue the screams: One of the hardest-working couples in show business is headed on tour.
On Monday, Jay Z and Beyonce announced a joint summer trek that will take them to 16 cities throughout North America, starting in June.
The married couple first stirred anticipation that they'd tour together in early April, but the buzz was initially dampened by Jay Z revealing that his 2014 "Made in America" music festival will play in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia.
It seems the pair just wanted an element of surprise. Their announcement of the "On the Run" tour arrived complete with an image of the two wearing ski masks.
Even before they quietly tied the knot in 2008, Mr. and Mrs. Carter have dominated the music industry both as solo artists and as a couple. One of their recent collaborations, "Drunk In Love," was controversial but nonetheless landed at No. 1.
And with their "On the Run" tour, the duo are hoping to use their combined star power for good.
A dollar from each "On the Run" ticket sold will go toward the Shawn Carter Foundation, an organization that helps underserved groups go to college. The tour is also being presented in partnership with Beyonce's #BeyGOOD campaign, which seeks to inspire charitable work, kindness and community involvement.
Tickets go on sale for the general public May 2, while anxious fans can visit Beyonce's or Jay Z's Facebook page for information on advance purchases. The tour will launch in Miami on June 25 and wind down in San Francisco on August 5.
