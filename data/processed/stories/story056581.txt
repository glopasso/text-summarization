(CNN)The winning machine that is Lindsey Vonn proved unstoppable again Sunday with rivals left trailing in the World Cup super-G at St Moritz.
Vonn had disappointed in the downhill on the same slopes 24 hours earlier, but reasserted her dominance in the speed events with an emphatic victory.
It extended the 30-year-old American's all-time record to 64 World Cup wins and she became the first woman to win a super-G at the famous Swiss resort on three occasions.
Vonn only leveled with Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proll on 62 wins last weekend in Cortina d'Ampezzo, then watched by her boyfriend Tiger Woods, broke the record with a super-G success at the same venue.
Her latest triumph repeats a feat she last achieved in December 2012 of back to back super-G wins.
Vonn has returned to the World Cup circuit in superlative form after the injury woes which cost her the chance to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and starting number 17 on Sunday produced a near-perfect run of one minute 23.55 seconds.
Only second placed Anna Fenninger of Austria got within a second of Vonn, the Olympic champion in super-G finishing 0.24 seconds adrift.
A second Austrian, Nicole Hosp, took third at 1.10 seconds slower.
Home home Lara Gut, who won Saturday's downhill, crashed out in the netting, while overall World Cup leader Tina Maze of Slovenia again disappointed in 18th spot.
It is completing perfect preparation for Vonn ahead of next month's world championships in Vail, Colarado.
On the men's World Cup circuit., Sweden's Mattias Hargin claimed victory in the slalom at Kitzbuehel.
He took full advantage of a mistake on the second leg by home favorite Marcel Hirscher, who was relegated to second after leading first time down.
It was Hargin's maiden World Cup win, with last year's winner Felix Neureuther of Germany in third.
