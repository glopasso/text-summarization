Open Road Films will release its Steve Jobs biopic "Jobs" on August 16.
Ashton Kutcher stars in the title role as Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The film is directed by Joshua Michael Stern ("Swing Vote"). Originally set for an April 19 release as a gesture towards the anniversary of Apple's founding, in March Open Road Films pulled the film from that weekend hoping to find a better slot.
The August 16 weekend is already fairly full, with wide releases including Universal's action sequel "Kick-Ass 2," The Weinstein Company's drama "The Butler," and Relativity's thriller Paranoia, not to mention limited releases like "Ain't Them Bodies Saints," "Austenland," and "Prince Avalanche," which all played Sundance. That weekend is, however, somewhat comfortably outside the territory of the tentpole summer blockbuster hopefuls. "Elysium," "Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters," "Planes," and "We're the Milllers" open the weekend prior.
Jobs premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film festival and co-stars Matthew Modine, Dermot Mulroney, and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak. In January, EW's Owen Gleiberman wrote that Gad's performance "strikes the most relatable note in the movie."
