(CNN)  -- Illness forced Whitney Houston to postpone the first four shows of the European leg of her "Nothing But Love" comeback tour, her publicist said Wednesday.
"Doctors visited Whitney late last night in Paris and confirmed that she was suffering from an upper respiratory infection," a statement issued Wednesday said. "Upon medical advice Whitney has been advised that she cannot perform to allow her time to recover."
It was announced Monday that Houston would miss Tuesday's show in Paris because of the illness, but now doctors have advised her to cancel her first three United Kingdom performances, the publicist said.
"Only last month Whitney had said how excited she was to be performing again in the U.K. after her eleven year absence and was looking forward to performing new songs as well as crowd favorites," the statement said.
Her two Manchester, England shows have been moved from Thursday and Friday to the end of her tour on June 17 and 18, the publicist said.
The Glasgow, Scotland concert has been shifted from this Sunday to May 1, he said.
The tour is expected to resume next Tuesday in Birmingham, England.
Houston just completed a tour of Asia and Australia.
