A shooting suspect and one of three people he shot Tuesday at a Dallas Area Rapid Transit station just north of Dallas have died of their wounds, officials said.
The shootings happened at 3:30 p.m. at the Arapaho station in Richardson, Texas, according to DART spokesman Mark Ball.
"A DART female officer had been alerted by a bus operator about an issue with a customer, so she went to the station to meet the bus," Ball said.
"Meanwhile, a second bus pulled into the station and that operator also indicated they had someone attempting to board the bus that was being unruly. The suspect got off the bus and started walking towards the train station. When our officer approached him, he started firing."
The DART officer received non-life threatening gunshots to her bulletproof vest and her arm, Ball said. Two male passengers also were shot. One of them later died.
Richardson Police spokesman Kevin Perlich told reporters during a press conference at the scene. It was unclear if they were hit by crossfire or were targeted by the gunman, Perlich said.
The suspect fled to a warehouse across the street, where he died of a gunshot wound to the head, Perlich said. He did not know if the gunshot was self-inflicted or if the suspect was shot by police during a shootout at the vacant building.
Several dozen people were evacuated at the DART station.
Police have not released the identities of the shooter or the victims.
