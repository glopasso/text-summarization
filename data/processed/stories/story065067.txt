Guys, I think he means it.
With no clear frontrunner or obvious "next-in-line" candidate in the field of potential 2016 GOP presidential contenders, Mitt Romney keeps getting asked if he's thinking about throwing his hat in the ring one more time.
But it's not entirely a far-fetched question.
A poll of New Hampshire Republicans and independents who lean that way found that Romney would be the 2016 frontrunner if he decided to run.
The 2012 GOP nominee has done little to stay out of the limelight, especially this year, as he gets involved in numerous races — including GOP primaries — and keeps up a fairly regular routine of media appearances.
He has assumed a sort of party elder role, and just finished hosting close to 300 major donors and politicians at his third annual Park City retreat.
He was asked as recently as last week on "Meet the Press" if he would still turn down another presidential bid -- even if drafted.
The former Massachusetts governor has been accused of flip-flopping in the past, but he's been pretty consistent on his future: He's a "no."

7. "I've had my turn, I gave it two good shots, didn't win and now it's time for someone else to do it. I'm not running for president. I made that clear the morning after the last loss."

9. "I loved it. But look, I want to make sure that we take the country in a different direction. I think that Chris Christie and Paul Ryan and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and the list goes on, have a much better chance of doing that, and so I will support one of them as they become the nominee."

Oh, and Ann Romney is done, too.
"I think I'm over it. Life is good. Life moves on. There's woulda-coulda-shouldas, of course, that you feel all the time. But no, our life is wonderful and I'm very happy right now, in a good place."
