(EW.com) -- South by Southwest is right around the corner, and Coachella's already prepping its polo grounds for a two-weekend extravaganza, which means it's time to look forward to that third major warm-climate festival: Bonnaroo.
Manchester, Tennessee's, second most exciting tourist attraction (we see you, Old Stone Fort!) will take place June 7-10 this year, and its newly announced lineup is as impressive as ever. Perhaps the biggest headliner are Radiohead (who are also doing Coachella); also on the top of the masthead are the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Phish, who are no strangers to Bonnaroo's muddy festivities.
Some of the fest's bigger acts -- many of which you may remember from the Grammys -- include Skrillex, the Shins, Bon Iver, Bad Brains, the Civil Wars, comedian Aziz Ansari, and the reunited Beach Boys (hopefully without Foster the People, though they will be there too).
Of course, there's many, many more. Check out the full list of artists below:
