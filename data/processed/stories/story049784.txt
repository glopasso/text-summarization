(EW.com) -- In response to Netflix's recently released list of the "Top 10 Movie Rentals of All Time," BitTorrent has release its own -- albeit utterly illegal -- list of the "Top 10 Most Pirated Movies" of all time.
The usual suspects were there, with "Avatar" (21 million downloads) taking top (dis?)honors, and "The Dark Knight" tying for second place with "Transformers" at 19 million downloads apiece. And, yes, of course there's a "Pirates of the Caribbean" installment on there. It's only right.
Still, there is surprisingly little overlap between the lists (only "Inception" and "The Departed"). Apparently Netflix users favor Oscar bait while Internet thieves go for tentpole popcorn movies, with the Venn Diagram overlap between those two strangely being Leonardo DiCaprio. So what other movies made the list, and which were the most head scratch-inducing? See the full list after the jump.
1. Avatar (2009)
2. The Dark Knight (2008)
3. Transformers (2007)
4. Inception (2010)
5. The Hangover (2009)
6. Star Trek (2008)
7. Kick-Ass (2010)
8. The Departed (2006)
9. The Incredible Hulk (2008)
10. Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (2007)
