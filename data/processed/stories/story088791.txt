The Association of Southeast Asian Nations will send observers to the tense Thailand-Cambodia border, where a disputed centuries-old temple is located, the organization said Tuesday.
Foreign Ministers and representatives from ASEAN's 10 member nations met in Jakarta Tuesday to discuss the long-standing border conflict. In a statement issued after the meeting, ASEAN says it welcomes "the invitation by both Cambodia and Thailand (for) observers from Indonesia, current chair of ASEAN, to observe the commitment by both sides to avoid further armed clashes between them."
Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa said in a news conference that the civilian and military observers will be unarmed. The team will be there to assist and support both countries to keep their commitment avoid further clashes.
"It is still their responsibility to maintain the ceasefire," he said.
Deadly clashes erupted again at the border earlier this month. The disputed area is the site of Preah Vihear, a 900-year-old Hindu temple. In 1962, an international court awarded the temple to Cambodia, but Thailand claims that the area around the temple has not been clearly demarcated.
The two countries have been in a stand-off since 2008, when UNESCO granted Preah Vihear World Heritage Status.
Since the renewed fighting, ASEAN has sent Natalegawa to meet with leaders of both Thailand and Cambodia to try to ease tensions.
The U.N. Security Council has also called for a permanent cease-fire and backed ASEAN's efforts to mediate.
On Tuesday, Natalegawa said ASEAN is stepping up to the plate and is "waging peace aggressively". He expressed hope they can send off the observers to the border "sooner rather than later."
He could not say how many observers will be part of the team.
He also added Thailand and Cambodia will continue to try resolving the conflict through bilateral talks, although Indonesia will be engaged in the process. The next bilateral meeting is expected be held in Jakarta.
