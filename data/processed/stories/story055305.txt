The loglines:
TNT Scripted Series:
• Portal House: This project is the story of a group of young scientists who, while investigating what they believe to be a haunted house, stumble upon a portal into the time-space continuum. Things then take a turn for the worse when one of their own vanishes into the portal.

• Peter Gunn: This re-imagining of the classic post-modern Blake Edwards-Craig Stevens' series centers on a gentleman private eye who is not above getting his bespoke suit and tie dirty, if that's what it takes to bring down the bad guys, save his hometown and win back the love of the gal he left behind.

• The Last Cop: Life can seem to pass in the blink of an eye, but for LAPD cop Mick Branigan it actually did in this project based on the hit German series. After almost 20 years in a coma, Mick awakens to a changed world — his loving wife has moved on, his teenage daughter doesn't know him, and his old police force bears no resemblance to the one he knew in the '90s.
Executive Producers: Sylvester Stallone, Kevin King, Mikkel Bondesen, Chris Fedak (writer) and Kristen Campo (co-executive producer)
• A Bend in the Road: This character drama based on Nicholas Sparks' book is set in a resort town. Sheriff Miles Ryan is known for his keen ability to solve crimes and his deep understanding of the town's citizens. But what Miles doesn't realize is just how many secrets are buried beneath the very streets he walks -- the most unsettling having to do with the unsolved murder of his wife.
Executive Producers: Nicholas Sparks, Theresa Park and Brandon Camp (writer)
• Guilt by Association: Based on the debut novel by Marcia Clark, lead prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial, this project centers on Rachel Knight, a gutsy Deputy District Attorney in the Special Trials Unit of the D.A.'s office for L.A. County. She works closely with a tough-as-nails female LAPD detective named Bailey Keller and a stylish female prosecutor named Toni LaCollette, both of whom routinely crash at Rachel's place.
Executive Producers: Marcia Clark (writer), Dee Johnson (writer) and Nelson McCormick (director)
• Lew Archer: Based on the title character from Ross McDonald's popular novels, this project from The Closer creator James Duff and Close to Home creator Jim Leonard follows the sleuth many consider to be "the original P.I."
Executive Producers: James Duff, Jim Leonard (writer) and Steve N. White.
EW: Frank Darabont TNT drama picked up, reunites 'Walking Dead' actors
• Crushed: This primetime soap focuses on two rich lovers: Caz, whose father, Jeremy owns Terra Winery, and Daphne, Jeremy's young wife.

The show explores an eccentric but brilliant group of people who investigate crime, reveal way too much personal information about themselves and refuse to rest until justice has been served. These dedicated men and women are more than counter-intuitive; they are non-intuitive.
Executive Producers: Steve Carell and Nancy Carell

Each week, two law enforcement officials from diverse backgrounds and departments immerse themselves in each other's lives and jobs in an effort to learn something that will make them better officers, partners and citizens of the law.
