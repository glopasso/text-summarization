William Guarnere, a World War II veteran popularized by the "Band of Brothers" miniseries, has died. He was 90.
Guarnere was rushed to a hospital early Saturday morning and died of a ruptured aneurism that night, his son, William Guarnere Jr., told CNN.
"He lived a good life. He traveled a lot. He pretty much did everything he could have done," the son said Sunday.
During the war, Guarnere earned the nickname "Wild Bill." He lost a leg trying to save a friend on the battlefield.
The HBO miniseries was based on a book by Stephen E. Ambrose.
It told the story of Easy Company, 506th Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division, U.S. Army. Guarnere was played by actor Frank John Hughes.
The family is planning a funeral this week in Philadelphia, where Guarnere was born and lived most of his life, his son said.
