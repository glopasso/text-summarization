(WIRED)  -- Who says Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has no sense of humor when it comes to "The Social Network," the Oscar-nominated film which he has said got nothing right except his T-shirt collection?
Zuckerberg made a very sporting cameo tonight on NBC's "Saturday Night Live," running lines with guest host Jesse Eisenberg and SNL player (and frequent Zuckerberg "impersonator") Andy Samberg, during the show's opening monologue.
As Samberg and Eisenberg -- Oscar-nominated for his portrayal of Zuckerberg in "The Social Network" -- bantered on stage, the camera cut away to the real Zuckerberg in trademark T-shirt and hoodie off stage with show producer Lorne Michaels.
"Those guys are just nerds," said Zuckerberg, whose company was recently valued at $50 billion and is perhaps the wealthiest person ever to take the SNL stage. "I invented 'poking it!'"
Moments later Zuckerberg joined Eisenberg and Samberg as they were comparing notes on how they each nail their own impressions of the Facebook CEO.
"I wear this sweatshirt and I say, "I am Mark Zuckerberg," Samberg shared.
"Have you not met," Samberg asked, as both Zuckerberg and Eisenberg shook their heads. "AWK-BERRRRRG WAAAARD!" he said, bowing out.
Faux nervous silence ensued.
"I really liked you on '60 Minutes,'" Eisenberg finally offered. "You ... ever end up seeing the film?"
Zuckberg nods.
"And what did you think?" Eisenberg asked.
"It was ... interesting," Zuckerberg replied.
"OK -- I'll take it."

Then Zuckerberg introduced the program and it was all, handshakes, smiles and pats on the back.
Zuckerberg, still all smiles, stuck it out for the entire 90-minutes program, taking a final bow with Eisenberg at 1 a.m. Maybe he'll even put in an appearance at the wrap party.
