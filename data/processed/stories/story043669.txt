(CNN)An American actor living in Canada has been arrested on voyeurism charges in Toronto, police said.
Jean-Paul Manoux, also known as J.P. Manoux, was arrested on Tuesday.  He's scheduled to appear before a judge on March 11.
It started when two women in their mid-twenties rented a condo from the actor.  According to the Toronto Police Service, the women alerted them after they "discovered hidden cameras and video equipment connected to the internet."
Police said in a statement that the actor has rented out this condo before and they "believe there may be other victims."
The 45-year-old Manoux is a U.S. citizen, but a permanent resident of Canada.  He works in both countries, according to the his website.
He's a busy actor, but largely in smaller parts, with more than 140 film and television credits, according to IMDb.
You may have seen him in the film "Knocked Up," or on TV in "ER," "Community," "How I Met Your Mother," and most recently the Canadian sitcom "Spun Out."
CNN has reached out to Manoux's representatives, but they have yet to respond.
