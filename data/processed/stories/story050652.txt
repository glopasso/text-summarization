Gambia has severed all economic and diplomatic relations with Iran and set a 48-hour deadline for Iranian government officials to leave the West African country, Iran's state-run Press TV reported Tuesday.
Gambia gave no reason for the decision to sever ties with the Islamic Republic, according to Press TV.
The news comes after the seizure of a shipment of arms from Iran in Nigeria that may be linked to Gambia.
The 13 containers seized in Lagos held illegal weapons, including rockets, according to Nigeria's security service. Earlier this month, Nigerian Foreign Minister Odein Ajumogobia said the original bill of lading was destined for Nigeria, but another bill of lading destined for Gambia later surfaced.
Ajumogobia has said the seizure has been reported to the United Nations Security Council.
