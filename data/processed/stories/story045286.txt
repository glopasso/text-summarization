The Secretary of the Navy issued censure letters Friday to four naval officers for the roles they played in a series of raunchy videos shown aboard the USS Enterprise between 2005 and 2007, a spokesman said.
The letters, which cannot be appealed, effectively end the officers' careers as they will prevent promotion, said Navy spokesman Capt. Danny Hernandez.
Capt. Owen Honors, who lost command of the aircraft carrier soon after the videos were made public, was issued a letter.
Letters were also issued to Rear Adms. Lawrence Rice and Ron Horton, who were commanders of the Enterprise at the time Honors, then the ship's second-in-command, was making and showing the videos. Capt. John Dixon, former executive officer of the Enterprise who took over as second-in-command after Honors, also was censured.
Adm. John Harvey, head of Fleet Forces Command, said this month that in addition to the top brass, he would send nonpunitive "letters of caution" to 32 officers and sailors who helped produce and broadcast the videos. Those letters will not become part of those individuals' permanent files.
In January, Harvey removed Honors as commanding officer of the Enterprise, claiming that the captain demonstrated poor judgement with videos he created on the carrier between 2005 and 2007.
The videos, which mocked gays and simulated masturbation and naked shower scenes, created an uproar when they became public. Honors claimed that the videos were morale boosters and helped inform the crew about important issues.
Naval investigators found 55 videos stored on the carrier's computer system, and 25 were determined to be vulgar and objectionable and in violation of proper behavior, Harvey has said.
Shortly after news of the videos broke, the Enterprise left for the Middle East with a new commanding officer.
