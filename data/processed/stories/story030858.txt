(EW.com) -- The sex is in the heel, indeed! The Harvey Fierstein-Cyndi Lauper musical Kinky Boots (based on the 2005 British film) dominated the Tony nominations, garnering 13 Tony nominations, including a best score nod for Lauper for her first-ever musical. Trailing not far behind were Matilda (12 nods), whose four tweens sharing the title role will be recognized with a special award on Tony night, Pippin (10 nods), and Rodgers + Hammerstein's Cinderella (9 nods).
On the play side, the celebrated revival of Clifford Odets' Golden Boy proved strong as its boxer lead character, with 8 nods. Tom Hanks guns for EGOT territory with a best actor in a play nod in his first Broadway role in Lucky Guy (its late author Nora Ephron was also nominated for the journalism bio). But perhaps the biggest surprise was the very strong showing for Christopher Durang's Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike with 6 nods, including one in each acting category (though star Sigourney Weaver's comic turn was overlooked).
