The wife of a man killed by a shark during their honeymoon in the Seychelles islands paid tribute to him Wednesday, calling him a devoted husband and "best friend."
Ian Redmond of Britain died after he was attacked by a shark Tuesday off Anse Lazio beach on the island of Praslin, authorities said.
"I loved him so much and he was a very special husband, a thoughtful son and a devoted brother. He worked tirelessly to give us both a wonderful married life and home and I want to thank him for nine years of joy," his wife, Gemma Redmond, said.
"We were having so much fun and we were so excited about our future together. Myself, our families and our friends are devastated and shocked by what has happened. The loss of Ian has left a gaping hole in our hearts that will never be filled.
"He was always calm and collected, strong and brave, witty and intelligent, handsome and caring, a remarkable individual who will be deeply and sorely missed. We are privileged and proud to have shared our lives with him," she added.
The British high commissioner and a consular official have traveled to the island off the east coast of Africa, the U.K. Foreign Office said.
"Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time," the Foreign Office said.
Authorities in the Seychelles, an Indian Ocean archipelago, have issued a temporary ban on entering the water in five areas following two fatal shark attacks this month -- the one on Redmond and another two weeks ago.
French newspaper Le Figaro reported that a 36-year-old French man was badly bitten on the legs and died as he dived off the same beach in early August. An autopsy concluded he was the victim of a shark attack, the paper said.
