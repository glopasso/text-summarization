PARIS, France (CNN)  -- When the day is done, the vibrant Marais boasts more than its fair share of drinking, dining and people-watching opportunities. Kick-start the evening with an aperitif or two at one of the tiny bars along Rue Vieille du Temple, such as the '50s-inspired Pick-clops, La Belle Hortense or Le Petit Fer a Cheval. Measure your coolness quotient at the Moroccan-inspired Andy Wahloo (Rue des Gravilliers) or jostle for space at La Perle (Rue de la Perle).
Less hedonistic than a night out in London or New York, Paris still boasts a vibrant and eclectic nightlife.
For chilled tunes, cocktails and top people-watching, visit the Hotel Costes (Rue St-Honore), a veritable temple to opulence. The brief to star designer Jacques Garcia was "all things in excess", and a visit will show he didn't hold back. More chilled out and with an unsurprisingly eastern theme is the Buddha Bar (Rue Boissy d'Anglas), another old favorite that still packs in the beautiful people.
Fancy a late-night tipple? The bars of Rue Oberkampf attract an eclectic crowd as the after-dark action moves further east into the slowly gentrifying neighborhood of Belleville. Kick off in the ultra hip Café Charbon, also famous for its brunch. At the bottom end of the street check out Le Kitch bar -- be sure to try one of its delicious green "Shrek" cocktails. Further up, Café Mercerie is also great for drinks -- happy hour ends at 9pm - while Chez Justine serves up delicious food without breaking the bank. If you're looking to dance the night away, head north to the clubs of Pigalle.  ......................
