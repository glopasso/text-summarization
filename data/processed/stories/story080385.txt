Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are no longer a couple.
The 36-year-old "Lord of the Rings" actor and his model wife, 30, have announced in a joint statement that they have "been amicably separated for the past few months."
Bloom and Kerr have been together for six years and quietly wed in July 2010. According to their statement, it was only recently that they "decided to formalize their separation."
The couple also have a son, Flynn, who celebrated his second birthday on January 6.
According to E!, which first reported the news, Bloom and Kerr were last photographed together by paparazzi on October 8. Their last public appearance is thought to be their September 19 attendance at the Broadway opening of Bloom's "Romeo and Juliet," which the actor is starring in with Condola Rashad.
Although their marriage is over, the two told E! that they "love, support and respect each other as both parents of their son and as family."
