A terrifying road rage incident involving a gang of bikers on Manhattan's west side has gone viral on the web after video of the incident surfaced online.
The New York City Police Department said a man driving a Range Rover with his wife and 2-year-old daughter inside Sunday struck a motorcyclist on Manhattan's West Side Highway, breaking his leg.
"It was an accident," says Lt. Karen Anderson.
The SUV driver pulled over, and the bikers surrounded his vehicle, hitting it and spiking the tires, police said. The driver pulled away, hitting three more bikers in the process, police said.
The gang, called "Hollywood Stuntz," according to police, chased the man, and he was forced to stop because of flat tires.
The SUV driver was cornered and beaten, according to police. He was later treated at a local hospital for slashes to his face and released. His wife and child were not injured.
One biker who was struck by the SUV, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, was arrested and faces several charges, including reckless endangerment, reckless driving and endangering the welfare of a child, police said.
Authorities have not identified the people in the SUV.
A helmet camera one of the bikers was wearing captured much of the road rage incident, including the moment when one of the bikers walks up to the SUV and smashes its window with a bike helmet. The video has been posted online.
Police say this same group of bikers descended on New York City and clogged up Times Square last year in what Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said is a "major stunt event."
Authorities say they were able to prevent the group from entering Times Square this year. Police arrested 15 bikers in total Sunday, seized 55 bikes and wrote 68 summons for various violations.
They are looking at video footage to try to determine if any other charges will be filed in the road rage incident.
"The investigation is ongoing," Kelly said.
