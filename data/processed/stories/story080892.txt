Reality TV star Snooki must prove in court next month that she was not annoying to people when she was on a beach in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, last month.
Police charged the 22-year-old star of MTV's "Jersey Shore" with disorderly conduct and creating a public nuisance when they arrested her on July 30. But a prosecutor added a municipal ordinance violation of annoying people on the beach during a court hearing Wednesday.
Snooki, whose real name is Nicole Polizzi, did not attend Wednesday's hearing. Her lawyer, Raymond Raya, appeared on her behalf to enter a "not guilty" plea on all charges, according to a Seaside Heights Municipal Court spokesman.
Polizzi faces up to $3,200 in fines if found guilty of all charges. The disorderly conduct charge could also carry a 30-day jail sentence.
A trial date was set for September 8.
