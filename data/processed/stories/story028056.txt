Remember the food pyramid, the old symbol that showed us what a healthy diet looked like?
Well, forget it.
First lady Michelle Obama and several other officials will unveil a new plate-shaped food icon Thursday that "will serve as a reminder to help consumers make healthier food  choices," the White House said. .
Obama will be joined by Agriculture  Secretary Tom Vilsack and Surgeon General Regina Benjamin during the event at the auditorium in the Department of Agriculture.
A Department of Agriculture statement, without describing the new icon, said it will be "an easy-to-understand  visual cue to help consumers adopt healthy eating habits."
"We presume that it will be divided into sections that will show you how much of different types of foods you should be eating," said Elizabeth Cohen, CNN senior medical correspondent, about the plate image.
The move is part of Obama's push to fight childhood obesity.
Earlier this year, the first lady announced her campaign called Let's Move, which is aimed at reducing childhood obesity in the United States within a generation.
During her announcement in February, she urged parents, teachers, physicians, coaches and kids to get involved and suggested they look at the new Let's Move website for tips and updates on beating obesity in children.
