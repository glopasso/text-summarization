Five people, including a child, died when their helicopter crashed in Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, that county's coroner said.
Three men and one woman also died, said coroner Tom Kukuchka. Authorities were still attempting to contact next of kin.
Holly Baker, with the Federal Aviation Administration, said the helicopter was reported missing with five people on board Saturday.
It departed from Greater Binghamton Airport in New York and was headed to Jake Arner Memorial Airport in Lehighton, Pennsylvania.
The wreckage of the Robinson 66 helicopter was found Sunday afternoon in a wooded area, Baker said.
The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
CNN affiliate WNEP reported that controllers at Wilkes-Barre/ Scranton International Airport lost contact with the helicopter around 10:30 p.m. ET Saturday night during bad weather.
The National Transportation Safety Board was en route and will investigate the crash, Baker said. The FAA will also investigate.
