Israeli coach Avram Grant has been appointed manager of English Premier League club West Ham United.
Grant left cash-strapped Portsmouth last month after leading them to the FA Cup final, where they lost to his former club Chelsea, but he could not prevent them from slipping out of the Premier League.
He replaces Italian coach Gianfranco Zola, who was sacked by West Ham's owners David Gold and David Sullivan in May, after they narrowly avoided relegation.
A statement on West Ham's official Web site read: "West Ham United are delighted to confirm the appointment of Avram Grant as manager on a four-year contract, subject to being granted a work permit."
Grant, who will be officially unveiled later this month, said: "I am proud and honored to be the manager of West Ham. It will be an exciting challenge and I am ready to do my best.
"This is a fantastic club with great fans and a history that is respected around the world. I am already looking forward to getting to work with my players in July and preparing for the new season."
Grant was widely praised for his stewardship at crisis-hit Portsmouth, who sank into administration with debts of over $170 million debt.
They were deducted nine points as a result, making survival in the Premier League all but impossible. Still, Grant led them to Wembley in the FA Cup.
Co-owner David Sullivan said: "I am delighted to welcome Avram to West Ham and am confident he will prove a success. We have taken our time over this appointment and are certain we have got the right man.
"We are all looking forward to next season with new players coming in and Avram's arrival is just the latest reason for real optimism."
