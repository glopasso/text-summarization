World champion Valentino Rossi pipped Fiat Yamaha team-mate Jorge Lorenzo on the finish line in a thrilling finale to the Catalunya MotoGP.
Rossi shows his delight after clinching a thrilling victory over Jorge Lorenzo in Barcelona on Sunday.
With Lorenzo starting on pole, the two riders dominated the race throughout before exchanging the lead several times on the final lap.
But Italian Rossi eventually sealed victory by just 0.095 seconds in front of 90,000 fans in Barcelona -- the 99th win of his remarkable career.
Casey Stoner finished third, meaning that he, Rossi and Lorenzo are now all level at the top of the championship standings on 106 points.
Stoner's Ducati managed to hold off the challenge from Repsol Honda's Andrea Dovizioso, who finished fourth, while Loris Capirossi came fifth.
Daniel Pedrosa, Colin Edwards, Randy De Puniet, Mika Kallio and Nicky Hayden completed the top 10 on Sunday.
"It was a great battle, the two Yamahas were flying on this track," Rossi told BBC Sport. "After some laps I knew I had to fight and it was a great fight to the end, I wasn't sure of the result until the end."
Stoner revealed afterwards that he had not been fully fit. "I've been slowly getting a little more sore and sick each day, and I was cramping after the warm-up," he said.
"I was really afraid about finishing the the race -- halfway through I just gave up, I had nothing left, and I decided to just run for the points."
