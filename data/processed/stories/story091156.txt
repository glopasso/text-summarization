The National Trust for Historic Preservation's 2009 Dozen Distinctive Destinations range from a quintessential New England waterfront community to an Old West boomtown in Nevada.
Virginia City, Nevada, is steeped in gold and silver rush history.
Each year the organization identifies locations across the United States that provide diverse cultural and historic experiences and share a commitment to preservation and revitalization. The 2009 list was released Tuesday.
"By preserving their historic fabric and having the good sense to hang on to what makes them so special, these towns and cities are ideal travel destinations," said National Trust for Historic Preservation President Richard Moe in a prepared statement.
Virginia City, Nevada, a historic mining boomtown, is among this year's selections. Mansions, saloons and old mines provide a backdrop for silver and gold rush lore and a glimpse into life on the frontier.
Across the country, the waterfront town of Bristol, Rhode Island, combines stunning views and recreational opportunities with stately old homes and eclectic boutiques and restaurants.
Also on the 2009 list: Athens, Georgia; Buffalo, New York; Fort Worth, Texas; Franklin, Tennessee; Hot Springs, South Dakota; Lake Geneva, Wisconsin; Lititz, Pennsylvania; Santa Barbara, California; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Saugatuck-Douglas, Michigan.
