Candice Swanepoel is officially hot.
Her fans already knew the Victoria's Secret supermodel was beautiful, but now Maxim has affirmed her status: Swanepoel has the top spot in the magazine's Hot 100 list this year as voted on by Maxim's readers.
The 25-year-old South African beauty bested more recognizable hotties such as actress Scarlett Johansson (No. 2), singer Katy Perry (No. 3) and actress Jennifer Lawrence (No. 5).
Maxim says in her bio on their site that "the impossibly leggy, blue-eyed beauty was spotted at 15 and quickly established herself among the elite, appearing on countless magazine covers, and strutting the runway as Victoria's Secret's alpha Angel."
"It's a huge honor to be Maxim's No. 1, among so many beautiful and talented women!" Swanepoel reportedly said. "It's a great feeling."
