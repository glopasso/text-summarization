Mini will be returning to the World Rallying Championship next month after the new Mini John Cooper Works car was unveiled in Oxford, England on Monday.
The iconic manufacturer will take part in next month's Rally of Sardinia from May 5-8, one of six events they will compete in this year, prior to racing a full season in 2012.
The cars will be driven by Briton Kris Meeke and Spaniard Dani Sordo, who finished fifth for Citroen in last year's championship.
Sordo told reporters at the car's launch: "The break since my last rally has been long enough, now we want to show how good we are.
"Everything is new for me this year. Bearing this in mind, the additional time to get accustomed to my new environment has definitely been helpful.
"Now I'm really looking forward to the new challenge and to fight for strong results with the Mini John Cooper Works WRC."
David Richards, whose company Prodrive has spearheded Mini's return, added:  "We have been working towards this moment for more than two years and it is truly exciting to be launching the Mini WRC Team and what I believe is the most stunning car in world rallying."
Mini are hoping to bring back the glory years of the mid-1960's when the manufacturer won the Monte Carlo Rally three times in the space of four years.
