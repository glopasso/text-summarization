Two separate grenade attacks hit the Kenyan coast Saturday night, killing one person and wounding at least 33 others, officials said.
One grenade in the southeastern town of Mtwapa killed one person and injured 31 others, said Nelly Mulluka, a spokeswoman for the Kenya Red Cross.
A second grenade hurled into a stadium in the coastal city of Mombasa injured two others, she said.
The attacks occurred in communities along the Indian Ocean, southeast of the Nairobi capital.
The East African nation has been on edge since it sent its troops into Somalia to pursue Al-Shabaab militants after the abductions of tourists and aid workers in Kenya. It blames the abductions on Al-Shabaab, which has denied involvement.
While no one has directly claimed responsibility, a statement posted online Sunday credited to Al-Shabaab said "the deteriorating insecurity in Kenyan cities is an embodiment of Kenya's misguided policies that place foreign interests above its national interests and the security of Western nations above the security of its citizens, thereby wasting the lives of its men and its resources for no real gain."
Al-Shabaab, which the United States considers a terror group, has threatened to attack Kenya if it does not withdraw its forces from Somalia.
"The Kenyan public must be aware that the more Kenyan troops continue to persecute innocent Muslims of Somalia, the less secure Kenyan cities will be; and the more oppression the Muslims of Somalia feel, the more constricted Kenyan life will be," the statement said. "Such is the law of Retribution. Your security depends on our security. It is a long, protracted war and Kenyans must neither harbour a reason for optimism nor hope for triumph."
While CNN could not independently verify the statement's origins, it posted on jihadist website that frequently published the group's statements.
