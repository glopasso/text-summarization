Violence flared in central Cairo on Monday as protesters threw Molotov cocktails at police, who responded in kind.
The protesters are angry at the government and the Muslim Brotherhood, a popular Islamist movement. They rallied near Tahrir Square, near the parliament building, just a block from the Interior Ministry.
A building in the area briefly caught on fire and was quickly extinguished. No immediate injuries were reported.
"The violence of the police is the same as the violence under Mubarak," said Tarek Famy, a protester. "The Brotherhood is exactly the same as the former regime. They're still as violent."
Longtime Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was toppled last year. The country is now headed by Mohamed Morsy, the country's first democratically elected president. Before taking office, Morsy was a leader in the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood.
The protests came on the one-year anniversary of deadly clashes on Mohamed Mahmoud Street, which leads from Tahrir Square toward the Interior Ministry.
Violence there last year left dozens of people dead. No one has been held responsible for those deaths, though several security officers remain on trial.
