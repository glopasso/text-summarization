Gusty winds knocked down trees throughout northern Georgia and the Carolinas on Saturday as severe storms brought heavy rains, tornado watches and flood warnings.
In Charlotte, North Carolina, a man died in a weather-related car accident.
According to police, the 33-year-old motorist was driving through heavy rain when the car ran off the road, turned sideways in the wet grass and the driver's side struck a utility pole. Three other passengers in the car, including a toddler, were taken to the hospital, but had no life-threatening injuries, police say.
At Raleigh-Durham international Airport, also in North Carolina, wind gusts reached 85 mph, which was higher than the wind speed recorded at the airport during hurricanes Ivan and Fran, according to the National Weather Service.
