(CNN)An armored truck carrying several million dollars worth of gold was robbed while it was stranded on Interstate 95 in Wilson County, North Carolina.
According to the Wilson County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to an armed robbery of more than $4 million in gold, just before 7 p.m. ET Sunday.  The armored truck was paused after experiencing mechanical issues during a trip from Miami to Massachusetts.
The two guards, employed by Transvalue Inc., were forced to the ground and robbed at gunpoint by three men driving a white van. The guards' hands were then bound behind their backs before they were instructed to walk into a nearby wooded area, the sheriff's office said.
"Transvalue Inc. deeply regrets the events that transpired yesterday evening," Chief Executive Officer Jay Rodriguez said in a statement to CNN. "We are pleased that our crew was not harmed. At this time we are working with the authorities to try and resolve this matter."
The FBI has also been notified, according to Public Affairs Special Agent Shelley Lynch. The FBI is "coordinating with our law enforcement partners to determine whether a federal crime has been committed".
Meanwhile Transvalue is offering a $50,000 reward for any information leading to the arrests of the suspects responsible, according to Rodriguez.
Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Wilson County Sheriff's Office at 252-237-2188.
