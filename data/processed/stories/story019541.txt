(EW.com) -- The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced key dates for next year's 85th annual Academy Awards.
Nominations will be announced on January 10, 2013, five days earlier than had been previously planned. That means highly anticipated Oscar nominations will be revealed days before the comparatively boozier Golden Globe Awards, which air live January 13, instead of after.
