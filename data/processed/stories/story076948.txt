Two teenage boys are being hailed as heroes after they chased a car carrying a kidnapped girl -- on their bicycles.
Five-year-old Jocelyn Rojas was playing in her front yard in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, when she vanished Thursday afternoon. Authorities believe she was abducted by a man who lured her by offering ice cream.
For two hours, neighbors and police scoured the area and asked if anyone had seen her.
Temar Boggs, 15, and his friend took off on their bicycles to search.
About a half-mile away, they spotted Jocelyn in a sedan. But the driver was elusive.
"Every time we'd go down the street, he'd turn back around, and then ... we'll follow him," Temar told CNN affiliate WGAL.
The two teens chased the alleged kidnapper on their bikes for 15 heart-pounding minutes. The driver apparently knew he was being followed and gave up.
"He stopped at the end of the hill and let her out, and she ran to me and said that she needed her mom," Temar said.
Jocelyn's relatives and neighbors took turns hugging Temar.
"He's our hero. There is just no words to say," Jocelyn's grandmother Tracey Clay said.
Police are looking for the suspect, described as a white male between 50 and 70 years old. He was driving a reddish-purple or maroon car with round taillights, WGAL reported. The man was wearing green shoes, green pants and a red-and-white striped shirt. He walked with a limp.
Although the suspect remains at large, Temar feels good about finding Jocelyn.
"I just feel like I did something very accomplishing today," the teen said.
The girl's family couldn't agree more.
