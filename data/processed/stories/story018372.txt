Mercedes are set to introduce a raft of measures to revive Michael Schumacher's flagging Formula One fortunes for the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix.
The seven-time champion returned to F1 this season after retiring in 2006 but has struggled so far, accumulating only ten points in the opening four races of the campaign.
But Mercedes team principal Ross Brawn says changes to Schumacher's car, including a new chassis and improved weight distribution, could help reignite his bid for a record eighth championship in Barcelona.
"It's not a new chassis per se, it's a chassis we used in testing," Brawn was quoted as saying on the official F1 Web site.
"The one he had got damaged during the first few races, and we repaired it as best we could at the races. But now we are back at base we are going to re-introduce the test chassis, and he will be using that in Barcelona.
"It has taken Michael a little time to settle into these cars and particularly the tires. These tires are very different to what he had last time he was racing."
Schumacher is being outperformed by Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, who has battled his way to second in the standings.
But Brawn is confident the 41-year-old will be pushing the front runners soon.
"It's foolish to say Michael is where he wants to be, but he's very determined to succeed," Brawn said in comments attributed to Reuters.com. "I think these frustrations are just going to make him try even harder.
"We've not had a fantastic start but we are still in there because no-one else is really dominating either - there is still plenty of opportunity.
"He is so determined, and you can see that in his driving. The bits where it's not quite working are not because of [lack of] skill or bravery, it's because the technique needs tuning, and the car needs tuning.
"It's odd places where he's losing time and that's why we think he'll sort it out and we'll sort it out."
The Spanish Grand Prix gets underway in Barcelona on May 9.
