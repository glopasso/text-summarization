A 2-year-old boy missing in Rhode Island has been found wandering the streets of Providence, according to Johnston Police Deputy Chief Daniel Parrillo.
Authorities had issued an Amber Alert for Isaih Perez on Sunday morning.
The toddler was taken to a hospital to be checked out, but he appeared to be in good health, Parrillo said.
Asked whether he had any idea how Isaih got where he was, Parrillo said he did not.
"A patrol man found him while on patrol just walking on the sidewalk. We don't know he was dropped off, if he was left off there, we don't have any particulars at this time," he said.
Earlier, Parrillo said that two men had been taken into police custody in connection with the kidnapping of the 2-year-old boy and a double homicide.
The toddler was not with either man when police apprehended them.
Authorities had said they believe Malcolm Crowell, 22, fled the scene of the homicide in Johnston, taking Isaih with him.
Crowell was found by police in Fall River, Massachusetts, following a tip related to an Amber Alert for the boy.
Authorities identified Daniel Rodriguez as a second suspect during their investigation, and he was taken into custody by police in Providence early Sunday evening, Parrillo said.
Charges are expected to be filed Monday.
The relationship between the suspects and the child is unknown, Parrillo said. The victims of the double homicide have not been identified.
Perez lived in the home where the double homicide occurred, CNN affiliate WPRI reported.
