The Cairo Criminal Court approved a freeze on the assets of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and upheld a travel ban against him Tuesday as the nation moves forward in pressing corruption charges against the ousted leader.
Mubarak's attorney, Samir Shishtawi, said he has filed an appeal.
Egypt's Supreme Court is considering lifting the secret status that shields Mubarak's accounts and holdings, which could potentially unleash a flood of information.
Mubarak, who is believed to be living at his residence in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, is wanted for questioning in a corruption case.
Attorney General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud issued an order freezing the assets of Mubarak and his family on February 28 and prohibited them from leaving the country.
Mahmoud ordered the freeze for property owned by Mubarak, his wife, Suzanne, his two sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and their wives and children, state-run EgyNews reported. The seizures include "movable properties, real estate, stocks, bonds and various financial assets."
It wasn't immediately clear how the order differed from an earlier order.
Mubarak, through his attorneys and in official filings, has described reports of immense wealth as "fabrications and baseless rumors."
Mubarak resigned February 11 after 18 days of protests against his rule.
Egyptian politician Mustafa Bakri, who has led the fight to press corruption charges against Mubarak, said he believes the former president will stand trial.
Bakri, a member of Egypt's parliament who lost his seat after filing corruption cases against various officials, provided documents indicating Mubarak's family has secret bank accounts totaling more than 200 million Egyptian pounds ($147 million), according to EgyNews.
"This is the second stage of the revolution," Bakri told CNN.
CNN's Nima Elbagir and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.
