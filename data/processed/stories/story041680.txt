You still can buy bling in West Hollywood -- or a pencil dress or a floppy hat or anything else you've seen a celebrity wear on the red carpet. Unless it's furry.
As of Saturday, it's against the law in West Hollywood to sell fur apparel.
The ban, two years in the making, is the latest measure taken by a city that considers itself "the Humane Capital of the United States."
West Hollywood also regulates chicken cages and passed what the city says was the first ordinance banning the declawing of cats.
Some residents planned to celebrate the new ordinance with a rally and vegan pizza party, CNN affiliate KCAL-TV reported.
But not everyone is thrilled. The West Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said the ban is unfair to the city's fashion businesses, KCAL-TV reported.
Pawn shops still can deal in fur, and individuals can wear fur and bring back fur products they bought elsewhere.
Violators of the ban on fur sale are subject to fines starting at $250.
