A man took off his sandal and charged toward Suresh Kalmadi, the chief organizer of last year's Commonwealth Games, as the arrested official arrived for a court hearing Tuesday.
Police immediately overpowered the attacker as officers hurried Kalmadi to the courtroom. The attacker was identified as a former lawyer.
Kalmadi was arrested Monday on corruption charges in connection with the October 2010 Games in the Indian capital.
Officials contend that Kalmadi, as head of the games' organizing committee, bought a score-keeping system from a Swiss company at "inflated costs."
He denies wrongdoing.
In February, investigators arrested two other senior officials involved in organizing the Commonwealth Games. They were taken into custody for the same suspected over-priced purchase of the score-keeping system.
