In 2013, our TV options were practically endless.
Anyway you wanted it -- live, DVR'd, online, through a streaming service -- you could probably get it. It was like something out of a Journey song. And so we turned to you, our CNN readers, for the second year in a row to find out which shows you absolutely could not do without -- the ones that you would proudly identify as one of your "favorites."
Earlier this month, thousands of you flocked to our TV polls to tell us your top five picks in the drama, comedy and reality categories. Interestingly enough, even with all of the new shows that arrived in 2013, your favorite comedies are more or less the same: "The Big Bang Theory" is still No. 1, with "Modern Family" a close second. The only difference, in fact, is that Fox's "New Girl" fell out of the top 5 favorites altogether, replaced by the even "New"-er "Orange is the New Black."
In the drama category, several voters were clearly feeling nostalgic for "Breaking Bad." The AMC show, which ended its run this year, didn't even make the top 5 favorite dramas list in 2012. This year, however, the Bryan Cranston and company were No. 1.
"Homeland" likely suffered under the weight of its own ludicrousness and dropped out of the top five this year. In its place is NBC's new drama "The Blacklist."
In the reality category, "Duck Dynasty's" reign couldn't be ignored. CNN reader votes pushed the contested A&E show into second place, knocking perennial favorite "Survivor" out of the top five altogether.
If you missed our voting period, feel free to play along in the comments. Tell us your top five favorite shows across the drama, comedy and reality categories.
