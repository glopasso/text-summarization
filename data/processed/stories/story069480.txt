Dwayne Johnson's mother and cousin survived a head-on collision with a drunken driver last week, the actor said Sunday.
Johnson, also known as the Rock, tweeted a photo of the wreck, showing his mother's white SUV with front-end damage, along with a message on Instagram on Sunday.
"First reaction is to find the person who did this and do unrelenting harm to them," Johnson wrote. "But then you realize the most important thing is my family lived thru this and we can hug each other that much tighter these days. Hug your own family tighter today and be grateful you can tell them you love them. #BearHugsAndGratitude"
Johnson suffered a personal loss in November when his "Fast & Furious" co-star Paul Walker died in a car crash.
The posting didn't detail their injuries, but his cousin -- WWE wrestler Lina Fanene -- posted a photo of the Rock visiting her in a hospital with the caption "We are a bunch of goof balls!"
Fenene posted an Instagram message about the collision: "'Everything happens for a reason' Not sure why the very intoxicated woman decided to drive her car, head first, into our car...but I do know that we are extremely lucky to be alive and that everything we have is fixable. It's a bump in the road, but we will get past it and be stronger than before! I'm grateful for all the wonderful LOVE I have received from everyone. My family & friends are AMAZING! Life is wonderful!"
It was not clear when or where the crashed happened, although his mother, Ata Johnson, lives in the Orlando, Florida, area.
It apparently happened early in the week, since a Tuesday tweet by Fenene included a photo of her on an airplane with her arm in a sling and the message: "Still all smiles! Very grateful to be alive for all the love from my family and friends! Incredibly blessed"
