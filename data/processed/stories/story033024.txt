A nephew of the Dalai Lama died in northeast Florida Monday evening after he was hit by a car while walking along a highway.
"Yes, it is true unfortunately," said Tempa Tshering, a representative of the Dalai Lama in New Delhi, India.
Jigme Norbu, 45, was walking southbound along A1A in Flagler County when he was hit by a car driven by Keith O'Dell, the Florida Highway Patrol said.
Norbu was taking part in a "Walk for Tibet" from St. Augustine to West Palm Beach, according to the Ambassadors for World Peace website.
