The space shuttle Endeavour undocked from the International Space Station for the last time late Sunday, as the craft nears the end of its final mission.
The scheduled 16-day mission began two weeks ago after multiple delays.
When Endeavour pushed away from the space station just before midnight, it had been docked for 11 days, 17 hour, 41 min, according to NASA's website.
The shuttle is scheduled to land at 2:35 a.m. ET Wednesday at Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
Space shuttle Atlantis will make NASA's final shuttle voyage July 8 on a mission to deliver supplies and spare parts to the International Space Station, the agency said.
