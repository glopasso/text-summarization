Two South Korean soldiers fired at a civilian airplane after mistaking it for an aircraft from North Korea, a South Korean military official said Saturday.
No damage was caused by the firing Friday morning, said the official, who requested anonymity in keeping with South Korean military custom.
The two soldiers were stationed off the coast of Gyodong Island, near the North Korean border, when they fired their rifles at an Asiana Airlines flight, the military official said.
The plane was not damaged because it was about 500 meters (547 yards) out of the range of the K-2 rifles used by two soldiers, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said, citing an unidentified military source.
According to the Yonhap report, the plane was carrying about 119 crew and passengers from China, and was making its descent to Incheon International Airport.
CNN's Jiyeon Lee in Seoul contributed to this report.
