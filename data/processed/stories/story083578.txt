A motorcade carrying Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the Philippines was pelted with eggs and other objects Wednesday, the State Department confirmed, but the car carrying Clinton was not hit and there were no injuries.
The incident occurred at 2:45 p.m. in Manila, when the motorcade was traveling from the presidential palace to another location, deputy State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters in Washington
"The secretary's motorcade ran into a crowd of approximately 40 to 50 people, protesters," Toner said. "They threw objects at the lead vehicle -- I believe it was eggs and paintballs, they maybe threw rock -- and the motorcade pulled out of that area and went to the next scheduled meeting place."
Toner later clarified that the "paintball" was more likely a balloon filled with paint. He also said that at no time was Clinton in danger.
Clinton is in the Philippines for commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty. As part of that treaty, she signed the Manila Declaration binding the countries to work together on a variety of mutual interests.
