A suicide blast in northwestern Pakistan Friday killed a 12-year-old boy and wounded five others, police said.
The attack took place at a weapons market in Dara Adam Khel, according to Masood Khan Afridi, the police chief of Kohat district.
The suicide bomber blew himself up after people thought his actions were suspicious and tried to apprehend him, Afridi said.
Dara Adam Khel is about 55 km (34 miles) southwest of Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the attack took place.
