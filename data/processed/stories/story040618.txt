Superstorm Sandy smashed the East Coast on Monday night, triggering floods, fires and devastation. Some residents affected by the storm used the Instagram photo app to quickly post square-shaped photos showing flooding, darkened cityscapes, fallen trees and damaged structures.
If you, too, have photos (and video) you would like to share, please go to CNN iReport, where you can contribute to the Open Story that shows the power of this storm. If you're on social media, you can mark your images and tweets with the #cnnireport hashtag.
