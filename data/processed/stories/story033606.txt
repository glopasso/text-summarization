Atlanta Falcons defensive end John Abraham was arrested late Monday, accused of obstructing police and firefighters at the scene of an attempted suicide. He is the second player from the Atlanta football team to be arrested in a week.
Running back Michael Turner was booked for driving under the influence on September 18.
Abraham entered an area responders had cordoned off with crime scene tape, while trying to talk down a woman who was threatening to jump from a floor of a high-rise hotel, said Atlanta Police spokesman John Chafee.
A firefighter ordered the football player repeatedly to leave the scene, Chafee said. But Abraham refused, even when police intervened.
"He again refused and insisted on continuing further into the scene," Chafee said. "Officers then took Mr. Abraham into custody."
He was charged at the county jail with two misdemeanor counts of obstruction. Abraham's relationship with the woman, if any, was not immediately clear.
According to CNN affiliate WSB, the woman did not jump and was taken to a local hospital.
The Atlanta Falcons issued a statement saying it was aware of the incident but declined to comment.
