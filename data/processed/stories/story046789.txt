Severe turbulence contributed to injuries aboard two flights that landed in Boston, authorities said Sunday.
In the first incident, seven people were hurt aboard a JetBlue Airways flight from Puerto Rico to Boston, authorities said.
Six of those hurt suffered back or neck injuries, said Boston's Logan Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella. The other suffered from a severe coffee burn.
Three of those injured refused medical attention, he added.
The aircraft was an Airbus 320 model, flying from San Juan with 130 passengers and five crew members on board.
Flight 852 landed in its intended destination of Boston around 10 p.m., about 20 minutes ahead of schedule, according to the airline's website.
In the second incident, Lufthansa flight 429 headed from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Munich, Germany, was diverted to Boston with 11 reported injuries due to turbulence. Orlandella did not know the extent of the injuries.
There were 245 passengers and 18 crew members on board. The plane later landed in Munich without incident, said Martin Riecken, a spokesman for Lufthansa.
