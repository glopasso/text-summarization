A Japanese helicopter plucked the pilot of a U.S. fighter jet from the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday after an unspecified problem forced him to eject in mid-flight.
The F-15 jet, from the U.S. Air Force's Kadena base on the island of Okinawa, developed the problem on Tuesday morning, the U.S. Air Force said.
The pilot, whose name has not been disclosed, is reported to have ejected safely about 70 miles (110 kilometers) east of Okinawa around 9 a.m., according to the Air Force.
A Japan Self Defense Force helicopter rescued the pilot, who was floating in the ocean with the aid of a life raft, the Japanese Coast Guard said. It didn't provide any details on the pilot's condition.
The Air Force said the cause of the crash will be investigated.
