A few months after Apple gave away a U2 album, angering some of the grumpiest folks on iTunes, the company is teaming up with frontman Bono again -- this time for charity.
To mark World AIDS Day on December 1, a special section of the company's App Store is offering special content for 25 apps, for which all proceeds will go to the Global Fund to fight AIDS.
Apps for (Red) is a partnership with Bono's Project (RED), which works with major brands to help combat the deadly disease worldwide.
"Apple isn't just in the fight to end AIDS. They are setting a new bar for business, giving $75 million and counting to the Global Fund as part of their partnership with (RED)," Bono said in a statement. "I couldn't be prouder to work with them."
The campaign starts Monday and runs through December 7. In that span, the App Store project will feature apps including Mighty Feathers (an Angry Birds spinoff), a special edition of Clash of Clans, a FIFA '15 (RED) tournament and a special Sims FreePlay event.
Apple will also release 300 new sounds for GarageBand and make available recipes from the likes of Mario Batali, Martha Stewart and Luke Holden in Kitchen Stories Cookbook.
Apple CEO Tim Cook called this year's annual (RED) campaign "our biggest fundraising push yet."
In September, Apple gave away a free copy of U2's new album, "Songs of Innocence," to all 500 million iTunes customers in conjunction with the release of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
On social media, some users complained that putting the album in everyone's library was intrusive, particularly on the heels of an Apple iCloud breach. Bono later apologized.
