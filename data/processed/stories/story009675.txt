He captained France to their first ever World Cup triumph in 1998 and led them to victory in the European Championships two years later. He amssed 103 caps in total.
A statement read: "The FFF has officially confirmed today the arrival of Didier Deschamps as coach of the France team.
"Captain of Les Blues during the World Cup 98 and Euro 2000, the former coach of AS Monaco, Juventus and Olympique de Marseille has extensive experience at the highest level."
Blanc resigned after a disappointing Euro 2012 campaign in which France lost to Spain in the quarterfinals and again were hit by problems in the dressing room.
