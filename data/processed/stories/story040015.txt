When politics and beauty pageants collide
There were boos when 22-year-old model Kaci Fennell was announced as the fourth runner-up. Viewers immediately weighed in with why they felt Miss Jamaica had been robbed of the title, citing everything from her race to her short haircut amongst the flowing manes of other contestants.
First runner-up was Miss USA Nia Sanchez.
Women from more than 80 countries competed in the event, which is owned by Donald Trump. TV journalists Thomas Roberts and Natalie Morales co-hosted.
