World Cup stars Bruno Alves and Miguel Veloso are poised to leave Portugal for new clubs in Russia and Italy.
Defender Alves, who played in all of Portugal's games in South Africa, will join Zenit St. Petersburg subject to passing a medical after his club Porto agreed a fee of $29 million.
The 28-year-old must also negotiate personal terms, Porto said in a website statement on Tuesday.
He has been at Porto, who finished third in the Portuguese league last season, since 2001 but has only been a first-team regular for the past five years.
Zenit, the 2007 Russian champions and winners of the the UEFA Cup the following year, were also third in their league.
Meanwhile, Veloso will leave Sporting Lisbon and join Genoa in a deal worth a reported $12 million, which will rise with various clauses.
The 24-year-old played twice at the World Cup, where Portugal lost in the second round to neighbors and eventual champions Spain.
He follows fellow midfielder Joao Moutinho in leaving Sporting, following that player's $14 million switch to Porto, with Genoa's Spanish midfielder Alberto Zapater moving to Lisbon.
"Sporting have reached an agreement in principle with Genoa for the transfer of Miguel Veloso and the acquisition of Alberto Zapater, with the consent of both players," Sporting said in a statement on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, English champions Chelsea will sign Brazil defender Ramires from Portuguese league winners Benfica according to several British media reports.
The 23-year-old is due to have a medical before signing a four-year contract by the end of this week, claimed the Daily Mail newspaper.
