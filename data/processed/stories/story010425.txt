Team USA's women booked a fifth successive Olympic soccer final after Alex Morgan's header 20 seconds from the end of extra time handed them a dramatic 4-3 victory over Canada.
Morgan nodded home in the final minute of extra-time to book the United States a tie with Japan in Thursday's Wembley final, where Pia Sundhage's team will go for a third Olympic gold.
Canada led three times in the match thanks to a hat-trick from captain Christine Sinclair, but each time the U.S. responded and eventually prevailed thanks to Morgan's dramatic winner.
World champions Japan booked a place in the gold medal match with a 2-1 defeat of France, who will play Canada in the bronze medal contest.
Canada has never finished higher than eighth in an Olympic soccer tournament, but John Herdman's side took a shock lead when striker Sinclair coolly converted after 22 minutes.
Protecting a proud Olympic record the U.S. responded and finally drew level when Megan Rapinoe's corner squeezed between Canada goalkeeper Erin McLeod and the near post 10 minutes into the second half.
Undeterred Canada hit back, Sinclair powering a fine header beyond the despairing Hope Solo in the U.S. goal after 67 minutes.
In a frantic period midway through the second half five goals were scored in 26 minutes, and Rapinoe hit a stunning half volley from the corner of the penalty area to level the match at 2-2 with 20 minutes to go.
The imperious Sinclair headed Canada ahead for the third time just three minutes later, but the U.S. found an equalizer in controversial fashion.
Goalkeeper McLeod was penalized by the referee for holding the ball longer than the allotted six seconds and from the resulting free kick Diana Matheson was adjudged to have handled Rapinoe's shot.
Prolific striker Abby Wambach calmly converted the penalty to make it 3-3, before Morgan settled the match in the dying moments of extra-time.
