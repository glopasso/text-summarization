It continues to be the year of Lupita Nyong'o.
The Oscar-winning actress has joined the cast of "Star Wars: Episode VII," it was announced on Monday. Also joining the J.J. Abrams-directed film cast is Gwendoline Christie, best known for her role as Brienne of Tarth in "Game of Thrones."
"I could not be more excited about Lupita and Gwendoline joining the cast of Episode VII," Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy said in a press release. "It's thrilling to see this extraordinarily talented ensemble taking shape."
The two will join the already announced cast of John Boyega, Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, Oscar Isaac, Andy Serkis, Domhnall Gleeson, and Max von Sydow. Former stars of the franchise Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher will be reprising their 1977 roles from the original, hit film.
Following the announcement Nyong'o tweeted "I can finally say it out loud and proud: I'm going to a galaxy far far away!" along with an Instagram picture of the "Star Wars" logo.
This year Nyong'o won a best supporting actress Academy Award for her breakthrough performance in the film "12 Years a Slave." She was also named one of CNN's Fresh Faces for 2014 and People magazine's 2014 most beautiful person.
