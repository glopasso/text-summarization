The Wildcats won on a three-point shot by Aaron Harrison with five seconds left in the game.
"Whoever had the ball last who could make a shot would win this game," Kentucky coach John Calipari said in a post-game interview.
On Monday, Kentucky will face Connecticut in the championship game. Connecticut beat top-ranked Florida 63-53 in the first game Saturday.
Attendance was 79,444 Saturday night at the Final Four at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, breaking the previous record of 78,129, according to the NCAA March Madness Twitter feed. The championship game will be played at the same site.
Kentucky finished their season strong but ended up as a No. 8 seed in their regional tournament. Wisconsin was a No. 2 seed in their region.
Florida was the top seed for the entire tournament and held a 12-point lead midway through the first half.
Connecticut, a No. 7 seed in its region, roared back, taking a slight lead at the half and expanding the bulge early in the second half.
"They showed us some true grit and toughness," Connecticut coach Kevin OIlie said in the post-game press conference.
Shabazz Napier said he and his teammates didn't panic when they trailed 16-4 early in the game.
"We've been through a lot of dog fights and continue to believe in each other," he said.
Florida coach Billy Donovan praised the Huskies' comeback.
"Once they got their defense set I think we had a hard time handling their pressure," he said.
Scottie Wilbekin of Florida, the player of the year in the Southeastern Conference, only scored four points. "On offense we couldn't get anything going," he said.
