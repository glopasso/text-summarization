Australia lost three late wickets as they ended the opening day of the first Test against India in Melbourne on 277-6.
Peter Siddle (34) and Brad Haddin (21) steered the hosts home after they stumbled from a comfortable position of 205-3, losing three wickets for just 18 balls in the process.
The biggest talking point, in front of a huge Boxing Day crowd at the MCG, was the dismissal of senior batsman Michael Hussey -- who has been under pressure recently following a string of poor scores.

Hussey suffered his third first-ball duck in eight innings after being caught behind off a Zaheer Khan delivery.
TV replays appeared to show that the ball brushed Hussey's sleeve rather than his bat, but India opted to reject the Decision Review System (DRS) for this four-Test series -- meaning Australia could not appeal against the dismissal.
Australia got off to a sticky start, losing their opening two wickets before 50 runs were on the board.
However, former captain Ricky Ponting (62) and debutant opener Ed Cowan (68) shared a century stand for the third wicket, before Ponting was caught at second slip as he continues his near two-year wait for a Test hundred.
India are bidding to win their first series in Australia in 64 years and currently hold the Border-Gavaskar trophy after winning the last two series at home.
Meanwhile, Thilan Samaraweera and Dinesh Chandimal shared a century partnership as Sri Lanka ended the first day of the second Test against South Africa in Durban on 289-7.
Samaraweera (86 not out) and Chandimal (58) made 111 for the sixth wicket after South African pace bowler Marchant de Lange had taken three leading Sri Lankan wickets.
