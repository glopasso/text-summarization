(CNN)Police in Detroit made a gruesome discovery Tuesday.
A bailiff performing an eviction on a home on the east side of Detroit called 911 after discovering the body of a female child inside a freezer.  While investigating the body, authorities found a second body, a male, according to a release from the Detroit Police Department.
Both bodies were inside a plastic bag, Detroit Police Chief James Craig said.
There are tentative plans to begin the autopsy tomorrow said Ryan Bridges, spokesman for the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office. He added that the office was waiting to allow the bodies to thaw naturally in order to preserve forensic evidence.
The mother of the children was apprehended at a separate location, and was later arrested on child abuse charges, pending the "results of the medical examiner's report," a release from the police department said.  Police have not yet released her name.
The names of the children have also not been released , but Craig said the boy was approximately 11 years old and the girl was approximately 14.
There were two older children living in the home. They have been placed in protective custody, according to Craig.
The chief said it's too early in the investigation to determine what happened.
"It's unknown what factors were involved in this," he said.
Moreno said the department is asking for the public's help to come forward with any information pertaining to the crime.
