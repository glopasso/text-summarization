A U.S. Air Force pilot was killed when the F-16 Fighting Falcon he was flying crashed in an noncombat incident in Jordan, officials said.
The crash happened at about 11 p.m. ET Sunday, U.S. Central Command said in a statement Monday.
The jet was returning to its base shortly after takeoff, the statement said. It did not give a location, other than to say the crash was not in Syria or Iraq.
A U.S. official told CNN the crash happened in Jordan.
Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said the plane suffered maintenance problems after takeoff and then crashed as it attempted to return.
Although it was a noncombat incident, the jet was headed to a combat mission, Warren said.
Per military policy, the pilot's name was not immediately released.
The crash remains under investigation.
