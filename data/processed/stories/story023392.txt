Olympic and world 100 meters champion Shelly-Ann Fraser has been suspended after testing positive for the recreational drug oxycodone.
Bruce James, the president of MVP track and field club in Jamaica, broke the news on Twitter, the UK's Press Association reported.
The 23-year-old was due to run in Lausanne on Thursday night, but withdrew for the start of her event.
The cause of her problems date back to a previous Diamond League meeting in Shanghai on May 23 where she tested positive after apparently taking medication for a toothache.
"We are withdrawing her from all competitions until we are able to have a hearing to determine what sanction will apply, or if she will be exonerated.
"Coach (Stephen) Francis is not upset with Shelly-Ann at all. He is actually proud of her for being brave enough to race in Shanghai.
"The IAAF have advised us that the offending substance is oxycodone. Google it. It is not a performance-enhancing drug."
Six Jamaican athletes have tested positive for banned substances over the last year, with all but one resulting in light bans.
A defiant Fraser told Reuters.com Friday that she would be proved innocent.
"I have nothing to hide," she said.
"I will go home and have a hearing before my federation in Jamaica.
"I hope they will accept my explanation."
The sprinter shot to fame when she won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, racing to an impressive 10.78 seconds in the final.
She doubled up as world champion in Berlin the following year.
Men's sprint star Asafa Powell, who is a member of the same MVP club and is also coached by Francis, claimed it was "not a big deal" as he spoke to reporters ahead of a track meet in Gateshead, England on Friday.
"So I haven't heard much, I don't know what exactly it is. I have heard it is not a big deal.
He added: "Everyone has to be careful in this sport, no matter who you are. Any little thing can turn out to be a big thing."
