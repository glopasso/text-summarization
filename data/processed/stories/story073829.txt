Brazil wants to give up the rights to stage the 2015 Copa America to neighboring Chile, its football federation confirmed Monday.
The tournament brings together the leading South American nations plus two invited teams from the CONCACAF region. Uruguay lifted the trophy in 2011 .
A statement on the CBF (Brazil Football Confederation) website said a meeting between its new president Jose Maria Marin and his Chilean counterpart Sergio Jadue had agreed the change.
Marin took over from Ricardo Teixeira at the helm of Brazilian football last week and has also taken his place on the FIFA 2014 World Cup organizing committee.
With worries that preparations for the World Cup were running behind schedule, Marin said in the statement that it "made no sense" to stage the 2015 Copa America when Brazil has also to deliver the 2013 Confederations Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.
Marin also claimed that the 2015 tournament would unfairly disrupt Brazil's domestic league competitions.
Brazil has agreed to stage the 2019 edition that was due to take place in Chile, but there is no confirmation from CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation, that the proposals will be accepted.
Since 1987, the 10 CONMEBOL nations have staged the Copa America in strict rotation with Brazil last hosting in 1989.
Brazil president Dilma Rousseff has recently given her government's pledge to assist in making sure that preparations for the 2014 World Cup run to time.
It came after FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke complained that "not a single stadium" was ready for the competition.
12 venues have been selected, including an ambitious stadium near the Amazon jungle city of Manaus, each hosting at least four matches.
