At least four people died when a plane made an emergency crash-landing in Ukraine on Wednesday, the Russian news outlet, state-run RIA Novosti, reported.
There were 45 people on board when the AN-24 crashed in the Donetsk region, an emergency official said. At least two people are unaccounted for. Thirty-nine were evacuated before the airliner caught fire, the official said.
"The plane missed the landing strip, turned upside down and broke into pieces," the official said.
The Donetsk-bound charter flight was carrying soccer fans from Odessa. They were heading to a UEFA Champions League game between Shakhtar Donetsk and Borussia Dortmund, the Ukrainskaya Pravda website reported.
