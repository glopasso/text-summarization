In an unprecedented move, Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will travel to New Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony Monday for India's new leader, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi will be sworn in as the head of the world's largest democracy after his Bharatiya Janata Party won a resounding election victory.
As well as attending the ceremony, Sharif will have a bilateral meeting with Modi on Tuesday and will also meet with Indian President Shri Pranab Mukherjee, according to a statement from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry.
Foreign Secretary Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry is expected to accompany Sharif, according to the statement.
India's external affairs ministry said Wednesday that invitations had been extended to the heads of all eight countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which includes Sharif.
"This is the first time that India has invited all SAARC members to attend a swearing-in ceremony of a prime minister," ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.
The attendance of Sharif at the ceremony may boost hopes of improved relations between the neighboring countries.
