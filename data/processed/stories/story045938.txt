Members of the European Union decided Thursday to formally lift sanctions on Cuba, a spokeswoman for EU Secretary-General Javier Solana said.
Christina Gallach said the decision, made over dinner during the first day of a planned two-day summit in Brussels, Belgium, will be formally confirmed Monday during an EU council meeting.
The diplomatic sanctions, which limited visits to the Communist island by senior EU personnel, were imposed in 2003 after concerns were raised about human rights in Cuba. The sanctions were suspended in 2005, so lifting them now could be considered a symbolic move.
Plans call for the human rights situation to be reviewed next year.
The move was seen as an attempt to encourage Cuban President Raúl Castro, who recently took the reins of power from his ailing brother, Fidel, to make progress on civil rights, officials said.
At least one EU nation, Sweden, had wanted to see more evidence of progress before taking the step but agreed to go along with the move.
The United States' trade blockade on Cuba, imposed almost 50 years ago, is not affected by the decision, but National Security Council spokesman Gordon Johndroe expressed disappointment over the move.
"We think the Castros need to take a number of steps to improve the human rights conditions for ordinary Cubans before any sanctions are lifted," he said.
State Department Deputy Spokesman Tom Casey said earlier Thursday that the United States did not support such a move by the European Union and sees no reason to shift policy.
"While we've seen some very minor cosmetic changes made by this regime, we certainly don't see any kind of fundamental break with the Castro dictatorship that would give us reason to believe that now would be the time to lift sanctions or otherwise fundamentally alter our policies," Casey told reporters prior to the EU's decision.
"So certainly, we would not be supportive of the EU or anyone else easing those restrictions at this time."
