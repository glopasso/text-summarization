Legendary soul singer Aretha Franklin is engaged to her "longtime friend and confidant," William 'Willie' Wilkerson, Franklin's spokeswoman said in a statement.
The "forever friends" are thinking about getting married in Miami Beach, Florida, with a reception afterward aboard a luxury yacht, the statement added.
The 69-year-old singer is considering Donna Karan, Valentino and Vera Wang to design her dress.
"We're looking at June or July for our date and no I'm not pregnant, LOL!" Franklin said in the statement.
Franklin, the so-called Queen of Soul, was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. She is known for hits including "Respect" and "Chain of Fools."
