Packing on the pounds over the holidays? Adam Sandler can sympathize. He recently put on some weight himself.
Adam Sandler had to cope with more than just falling gumballs in his latest comedy, "Bedtime Stories."
The comedian got buff for the movie "You Don't Mess With the Zohan" (in which he showed a lot of skin), but then he said he let himself go just a bit.
"[For 'Zohan'] I worked out like a madman," he told CNN. "And then I started getting fat again."
Concern over his physical conditioning led to an unintended consequence -- a broken bone.
"[One Saturday] I ate so much food, that I was laying in bed. I was fat as heck and I said, 'I better play some ball.' I went out and played basketball, broke my ankle. I said, 'Maybe I should have stayed fat.' "
The mishap occurred as he was filming his latest comedy, "Bedtime Stories." In scenes that involved walking around, Sandler needed a body double.
"I'm shooting the movie with the cast on," he said. "We did about six, seven weeks of shooting. If I was standing here and I had to walk to the door, I would stand up [then the camera would cut to] a guy with my outfit on that took the walk."
Sandler is on the mend, but he said his ankle is still a little swollen.
"Bedtime Stories" opens Christmas Day.
