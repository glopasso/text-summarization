It's an end of an era for superstar singer Celine Dion and her husband, Rene Angelil.
According to Yahoo News, Angelil is stepping down as his wife's manager after more than 30 years.
"It is with great pleasure and with the utmost confidence that Rene Angelil announces today that his long-time close friend, Aldo Giampaolo, has been appointed as chief executive officer of Feeling Productions Inc., the company which manages Celine Dion's career," a statement from the company said.
"Celine and Rene have decided that the time has come to bring this appointment to fruition, one that Rene had proposed to Aldo several years ago."
Angelil, 72, first met Dion, 46, when she was a teenager, and the couple began a romantic relationship when she was 19 and he was 45. The singer briefly retired from performing in 1999 when her husband was battling throat cancer.
People reported in March that Angelil had a tumor removed from his throat in December.
"I don't want Rene to stress out with work-related issues," Dion said in a statement to the magazine. "I want him to focus on getting back to 100%. I've been doing my shows at the Colosseum (in Las Vegas) and everything's under control."
The couple, along with their three sons, live in Las Vegas, where Dion has been performing for three years.
