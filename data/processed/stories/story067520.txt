Sweden's Carl Pettersson and Tiger Woods were neck and neck as the second round of the U.S. PGA Championship at Kiawah Island, South Carolina drew to a close on Friday.
Pettersson, who posted a six-under par round of 66 on Thursday, made a shaky start to his second round collecting two bogeys in the opening three holes, before hitting back with three birdies.
But further bogeys in the closing holes checked his progress once again allowing the more consistent Woods to edge closer to the top of the leaderboard.
Earlier, Fiji's Vijay Singh posted a round of 69 to finish on four-under par leaving leave him well placed to mount a challenge at the weekend.
England's Ian Poulter was also four under with a handful of holes to complete.
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy finished the day two-under for the tournament after shooting a disappointing three-over par round of 75.
Adam Scott is one shot further back after posting the same score, while Phil Mickelson is on even-par after firing a one-under par round 71.
John Daly slipped down the leaderboard into a tie for 16th on Friday. The 1991 champion finished with a five-over 77, one place ahead of 2008 champion Padraig Harrington who struggled to a 76.
Luke Donald's quest for a first major looks like it will have to wait until 2013 after a second round 76 left him on six-over par and in danger of missing the cut.
Early exits are also expected for Spain's Sergio Garcia who finished seven-over par, Lucas Glover and current U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson.
It was also day to forget for American club professional, Doug Wade, who couldn't have imagined things could get much worse than his opening round 83. They did. The club professional from Dayton, Ohio slumped to a 21-over par 93 on Friday -- one short of the all-time high score at the tournament.
