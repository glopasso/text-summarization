Comedian Chelsea Handler often aims to spark controversy, and one of her latest Instagram snapshots is no exception.
It shows Handler posing topless astride a horse in the style of a famous photo of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Her message: "Anything a man can do, a woman has the right to do better. #kremlin"
Instagram pulled the photo down more than once, according to Handler, because it violated the company's standards.
Handler posted a notice from Instagram that says the photo doesn't follow the app's community guidelines, which specify, "Accounts found sharing nudity or mature content will be disabled and your access to Instagram may be discontinued."
Handler argues that the company's implementation of its policy is sexist. "If a man posts a photo of his nipples, it's ok, but not a woman? Are we in 1825?"
Instagram has not responded to requests for comment.
The topic of women having the right to go topless on social media was addressed by Scout Willis, daughter of actors Demi Moore and Bruce Willis, in May when she posted photos to Twitter of herself walking topless in New York.
Willis chastised Instagram for its nudity policy in the tweets: "Legal in NYC but not on @instagram" and "What @instagram won't let you see #FreeTheNipple."
Handler has apparently decided that Instagram is too restrictive for her purposes. She posted a photo of her adorable pups to the site Friday along with a farewell message.
"You can now find my dogs and my breasts on Twitter only where my followers have the right to choose what they say. Bye bye instablock."
