This is one of the most science-oriented shows we've produced. From the imperfect science of forecasting the weather to the phylum of sea urchins, we're touching on meteorology, astronomy, technology, cartography, and biology in our Wednesday edition of CNN Student News. So take a 10-minute break from the textbook to watch science come alive on your screen!
