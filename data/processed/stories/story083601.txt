New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was involved in a two-vehicle accident Thursday morning near his home in Boston, Massachusetts, but is now "fine," according to a source familiar with the incident.
Brady was not injured and was already at football practice after the wreck, the source said.
The driver of the other vehicle was hospitalized, but the condition of that person was not immediately clear, the source said.
Law enforcement sources told the Boston Globe that Brady was driving a sedan and was treated at the scene.
The driver of the other vehicle, a passenger van, was transported to a local hospital, the Globe reported.
The accident occurred about 6:34 a.m., according to Boston Fire Department spokesman Steve MacDonald.
