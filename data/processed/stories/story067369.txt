The memorials and tributes to the late Nelson Mandela have grown way past the flags flown at half-staff and the thousands of flowers and candles left at South African embassies throughout the world.
In New York, the Empire State Building lit up in the colors of South Africa and the Apollo Theater in Harlem changed its marquee in tribute.
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Friday that a high school in Brooklyn will be renamed the Nelson Mandela School for Social Justice.
The Omni Hotel in downtown Dallas also used lighting to create a South African flag on its faÃ§ade in commemoration.
In Paris, the front of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs was draped with an enormous portrait of the former South African President, who died Thursday at age 95.
If this were a contest of creativity, the winner would likely be a massive sand sculpture of Mandela's face and the South African flag at a beach on the Bay of Bengal in Puri, India. That nation has declared five days of mourning.
In Washington, the site where hundreds were arrested decades ago in a protest against apartheid was turned into a shrine its most memorable foe. The South African Embassy is under renovation, but a space was cleared in front of Mandela's statute there for mourners to place flowers.
And in Johannesburg, people continued to stream to Mandela's home, bringing flowers and ribbons to add to the growing wall of color there.
