Tiger Woods has split with his longtime coach Sean Foley after not winning a major during their four-year tenure.
The world's most famous golfer has been hindered by injuries recently and cutting ties with Foley adds to his rocky 2014 season. In a statement on his website, the slumping Woods called Foley an "outstanding" coach but felt the time was right to part company.
Woods, currently nursing a back problem that will keep him out of next month's Ryder Cup, isn't due to compete again until an event in Florida in December and said he wasn't in a rush to appoint a new coach.
"I'd like to thank Sean for his help as my coach and for his friendship," Woods said. "Sean is one of the outstanding coaches in golf today, and I know he will continue to be successful with the players working with him.
"With my next tournament not until my World Challenge event at Isleworth in Orlando, this is the right time to end our professional relationship."
Foley, who coaches 2013 U.S. Open winner Justin Rose and world No. 19 Hunter Mahan -- champion at The Barclays on Sunday -- didn't appear to hold a grudge.
"My time spent with Tiger is one of the highlights of my career so far, and I am appreciative of the many experiences we shared together," Foley said. "It was a lifelong ambition of mine to teach the best player of all time in our sport.
"I am both grateful for the things we had the opportunity to learn from one another, as well as the enduring friendship we have built. I have nothing but respect and admiration for him."
The last of Woods' 14 majors came in 2008 and matching Jack Nicklaus' record haul of 18 could be difficult -- after once looking like it was a certainty.
