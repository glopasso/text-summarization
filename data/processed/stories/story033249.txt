Serie A side Napoli have completed the signing of Argentine international Gonzalo Higuain from Real Madrid.
A statement on the Spanish club's website published Saturday confirmed that the 25-year-old striker was on his way to Italy.
"Real Madrid C. F. announces that Gonzalo Higuain has been transferred to Naples," read the statement.
"The club would like to express their gratitude for his years of dedication and professionalism, and wishes him luck in this new step."
Higuain, who is reported to have cost Napoli in the region of $50 million, spent six-and-a-half seasons at the Bernabeu and scored a total of 107 goals in 187 appearances.
The Argentine joins a growing list of new signings as Napoli's new manager Rafa Benitez prepares for an assault on both the Serie A title and the Champions League.
Striker Jose Callejon and defender Raul Albiol both joined the Italian club from Madrid earlier this month while Belgian international winger Dries Mertens signed from Dutch club PSV Eindhoven in June.
Benitez has also signed Liverpool goalkeeper Jose Reina on a one-year loan deal.
Higuain is expected to fill the void left by last season's top scorer in Serie A Edinson Cavani. The Uruguayan striker, who scored 29 goals for Napoli last term, joined French champions Paris Saint Germain earlier this month in a deal worth a French record €64 million ($84 million).
