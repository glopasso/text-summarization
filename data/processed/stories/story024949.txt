Hosts Argentina remain winless at the 2011 Copa America after being held to a 0-0 draw by Colombia in Sante Fe on Wednesday.
The result left Sergio Batista's team second in Group A on two points, with Hernan Gomez's Colombia leading the way on four.
Striker Dayro Moreno wasted a golden opportunity to give Colombia all three points, but the 25-year-old could only fire wide from 12 yards with the goal gaping.
It was another frustrating result for two-time world champions Argentina, after La Albiceleste could only draw 1-1 with Bolivia in their opening match.
Despite calling on attacking talents such as FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Lionel Messi, Manchester City's Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero of Atletico Madrid, Argentina were unable to truly trouble Luis Martinez in the Colombia goal.
The home team's night was summed up on 80 minutes, when Barcelona's Messi blazed a free kick 20 yards over the crossbar from the corner of the penalty area.
A win for Bolivia in Thursday's other Group A clash against Costa Rica will mean Argentina have to secure three points in their final group game -- against Costa Rica -- to stand any chance of progressing into the quarterfinals.
"No one expected this kind of game," Batista told the tournament's official web site. "Nothing comes out the way we expected.
"We have a game against Costa Rica, and we can have five points to qualify. We need to keep calm, think it is a final and come out with this mentality."
Batista, who was part of Argentina's World Cup winning squad in 1986, also defended Messi, who has struggled to replicate his stunning club form for the national team.
"He has no space because opponents know how to play and close in the defence."
