An Orange County, California, man has been indicted on one federal count of knowingly attempting to provide material support and resources to al Qaeda, federal authorities said Friday.
The indictment also charges 24-year-old Sinh Vinh Ngo Nguyen, also known as Hasan Abu Omar Ghannoum, with one count of making a false statement to obtain a passport to facilitate an act of international terrorism.
Nguyen of Garden Grove was arrested Friday morning in Santa Ana attempting to boarding a bus to Mexico, FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said.
"Investigators do not believe Nguyen was traveling with others, nor are they aware of a continuing threat to the public at this time, based on his alleged activities," she said.
Eimiller did not detail the alleged activities, and the indictment did not spell out any specifics of the alleged actions.
Nguyen was scheduled to make an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana later in the day, authorities said.
