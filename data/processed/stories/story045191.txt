Rescue workers clear away debris after a building collapsed Wednesday in Mumbai, India.
Another 26 people were injured and hospitalized, the spokesman said. Mumbai city officials had told residents living in the old building to leave it because of structural concerns.
The chief minister of Maharashtra state, Vilasrao Deshmukh, visited the building hours after the collapse to pay his respects to the victims.
Last July, another building collapse in Mumbai -- formerly Bombay -- killed 26 people.
