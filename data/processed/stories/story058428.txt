McLaren's Lewis Hamilton was fastest in both opening practice sessions Friday for the Hungarian Grand Prix.
The 2008 world champion has had a miserable run of late in the race for the F1 title, but showed his class with a time of one minute 21.995 seconds in the afternoon runs before the session was hit by rain.
As the circuit became more treacherous, the British star stayed out to set fast laps before being pulled in by his team.
The conditions claimed seven-time champion Michael Schumacher, who lost the front wing of his Mercedes as he went off on Turn 11 of the Hungaroring at speed.
"I just locked up and run out of road," he told the official F1 website.
"By hitting the tires, I lost the front wing, but other than that, nothing is damaged on the car, I believe. It was the kind of incident that happens when suddenly a shower hits the dry track," Schumacher added,
The German star clocked a best time of one minute 23.160 seconds, but another former champion, Kimi Raikkonen of Finland was second best in his Lotus in one minute 22.180 seconds.
"We were second fastest which was good, and we've managed to improve the setup on my car over the last few races so I've been pretty happy with it," said Raikkonen.
Bruno Senna in his Williams was third fastest with the Ferraris of Felipe Massa and championship leader Fernando Alonso fourth and fifth fastest.
Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel was only eighth best in the Red Bull, with teammate Mark Webber, Alonso's nearest challenger, back in 14th.
Hamilton was quickest in the morning runs ahead of teammate Jenson Button as McLaren look to build on the improved performance of their car in Germany last weekend in the race at Hockenheim won by Alonso.
