Mike Starr, the former Alice in Chains bassist whose battle with drugs was chronicled on the reality TV show "Celebrity Rehab," was found dead in Salt Lake City, officials said.
He was 44.
Police said they responded to a call Tuesday of a possible death at a residence. The cause and manner of death were not immediately available.
Starr's former Alice in Chains band mates, Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney, released a statement, offering their support for his family. The band's original singer, Layne Staley, died from a drug overdose in 2002.
"Jerry and Sean are mourning the loss of their friend and ask that the media respect their privacy -- and the privacy of Mike's family -- during this difficult time. Their thoughts & prayers are with Mike's family," it read.
Alice in Chains, a U.S. grunge band, shot to fame in the early 1990s. Starr left the group soon after the release of its 1992 album, "Dirt."
He appeared on the third season of "Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew."
"Devastating to hear of Mike Starr succumbing to his illness. So very sad. Our prayers are with his family," the doctor wrote on his Twitter page.
