Joan Rivers could turn anything into a joke, and that includes her own funeral.
As unearthed by Mashable's Brian Ries, the comedian concocted a very specific, and very funny, burial service wish list in her 2012 book, "I Hate Everyone ... Starting With Me."
Needless to say, Rivers was not planning a simple farewell.
"When I die ... I want my funeral to be a huge showbiz affair with lights, cameras, action," Rivers says in the book.
Joan Rivers was a pointed, pioneering comedian
"I want Craft services, I want paparazzi and I want publicists making a scene! I want it to be Hollywood all the way," she continues. "I don't want some rabbi rambling on; I want Meryl Streep crying, in five different accents."
Mourners can skip the eulogy, because Rivers would rather have "Bobby Vinton to pick up my head and sing 'Mr. Lonely.' I want to look gorgeous, better dead than I do alive. I want to be buried in a Valentino gown and I want Harry Winston to make me a toe tag."
And, last but definitely not least, "I want a wind machine so that even in the casket my hair is blowing just like BeyoncÃ©'s."
We can only hope Rivers gets her wish. As of Friday, Rivers' service was set for Sunday at Manhattan's Temple Emanu-El.
