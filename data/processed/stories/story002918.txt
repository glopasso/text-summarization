MotoGP champion Valentino Rossi is back on his motorbike -- just a month after breaking his leg in a horrific crash.
The seven-time world champion took to the track on Wednesday only four weeks after suffering a compound fracture of his shin during a collision in practice for the Italian Grand Prix.
In a statement on Yahama's website the team confirmed Rossi would ride in Misano, Italy, in order to "better understand his current physical condition."
It had been feared Rossi would miss up to four months of action after the accident but his progress has been better than expected.
"Valentino Rossi will ride a Yamaha YZF-R1 at a private test in Misano, Italy," Yahama said.
"The Italian has made an excellent recovery so far since breaking his leg at Mugello on 5th June and he has decided to proceed with the test ride in order to better understand his current physical condition.
"Riding a racing motorcycle will help Valentino and his doctors to plan the next stage of his rehabilitation program in order that he may return to racing as soon as he feels confident to do so.
"The test will take place using a YZF-R1 WSB machine provided by the Yamaha World Superbike Team to the Fiat Yamaha Team."
Rossi had never missed a MotoGP race before his leg break, but he has been forced to sit out four so far. If his test ride is successful the 31-year-old could be back for the next race in Germany on 18 July.
His Yamaha team-mate Jorge Lorenzo currently leads the MotoGP standings, while Rossi lies in seventh place, 104 points off the lead.
