(CNN)  -- Germany coach Joachim Low has put an end to speculation over his future by signing a two-year contract extension which will keep him at the national side until after the 2014 World Cup.
Low -- whose contract was originally due to expire after Euro 2012 --had been linked to the soon-to-be vacant position at Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich, following the news that current boss Louis Van Gaal will step down from the role at the end of the season.
However, in a statement on the German Football Federation (DFB) website on Tuesday, Low confirmed that his foreseeable future lay with the national team.
"I am pleased that we were able to agree quickly to a continuation of the cooperation until after the World Cup," the 51-year-old former Stuttgart and Fenerbahce boss said.
"We believe that it makes sense to continue along this successful path with the national team. I enjoy this wonderful job and believe in the quality of our players and see good prospects for our team."
Low replaced fellow German Jurgen Klinsmann at the head of the national side in 2006, leading them to the runners-up spot at Euro 2008 and third place finish at the 2010 World Cup.
The former under-21 international has admitted that uncertainty over his future overshadowed last year's tournament in South Africa and said he wanted to avoid a repeat of that for the upcoming European competition.
The DFB also confirmed that Low's backroom staff -- assistant Hansi Flick, goalkeeping coach Andreas Kopke and team manager Oliver Bierhoff -- have signed new two-year deals.
Meanwhile, Bernd Schuster, the German coach of seventh-placed Turkish League club Besiktas has quit following the Istanbul-based side's string of poor results that has seen them claim just one win in their last seven matches.
The 51-year-old ex-German international and former Real Madrid boss' side also suffered a humiliating 8-1 defeat to Dynamo Kiev in the last 32 of the Europa League.
