Two attackers and a security guard were killed on Wednesday during an assault on a Red Cross building in Afghanistan and a gun battle between police and militants, an Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Insurgents stormed the International Committee of the Red Cross building in Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan.
Afghan parliament member Haji Hazrat Ali told CNN the incident started with one attacker blowing himself up and others entering the building.
Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said forces surrounded the building and engaged in a gun battle with the attackers. Seven foreign nationals were rescued and one ICRC foreign staffer was slightly injured, he said.
NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Afghan personnel secured the scene. The ICRC confirmed an incident occurred at the building.
On Friday, attackers wielding suicide bombs, grenades and machine guns in Kabul struck the compound of another foreign agency -- the International Organization for Migration.
Three Afghans died in the strike, the IOM said, and three international staffers were wounded, one seriously. The agency also said all of the attackers were killed. The IOM helps displaced people across the world.
Governor's office attacked in Panjshir province
Six men with explosives strapped to their bodies attacked a governor's office in northeastern Afghanistan just before dawn Wednesday, authorities said.
One of the attackers blew himself up; the others were shot dead by Afghan security forces, Sediqqi said.
The attack at the offices of the Panjshir governor also left one police officer dead and four others injured.
Panjshir is one of 34 provinces that make up Afghanistan.
In recent months, militants have repeatedly tested the Afghan security forces.
With international troops gradually moving out of the country, local police and the Afghan army have been left responding to the increasing attacks on their own.
