Lindsay Lohan acknowledged through Twitter postings Friday night that she failed a recent drug test, but the actress said she's "working hard to overcome" her drug addiction.
Lohan's supervised probation for a 2007 drunken driving conviction requires frequent drug tests. The judge warned her last month any failure could send her back to jail.
"Regrettably, I did in fact fail my most recent drug test and if I am asked, I am prepared to appear before judge Fox next week as a result," Lohan tweeted Friday evening.
She spent 23 days in a court-ordered drug rehab program last month, which followed a 13-day jail stint imposed when a Los Angeles judge ruled that Lohan violated her probation.
Judge Elden Fox, who took over Lohan's case when she was released, imposed a new set of rules for her to follow until November. It included weekly counseling sessions for alcohol and drug rehab, random drug tests and behavioral therapy.
"Substance abuse is a disease, which unfortunately doesn't go away overnight," Lohan tweeted. "I am working hard to overcome it and am taking positive steps."
