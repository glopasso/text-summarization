Travel photos open windows to the unknown.
For this season of CNN's "Parts Unknown," Anthony Bourdain has been expanding our horizons to show us places such as Paraguay, Vietnam and even New York's often-unexplored borough of the Bronx.
Instagram users and CNN iReporters followed along with Bourdain each week, sharing their travel photos from the places he visited. Some of their best travel photos were included in the above gallery.
It's halfway through the season, and we welcome you to share your photos from Bourdain's upcoming travel destinations: Tanzania (October 26); Iran (November 2); Provincetown, Massachusetts (November 9); and Jamaica (November 16). Upload them to iReport or tag your images #partsunknown on Instagram. We will add photos from these locations after each episode airs.
