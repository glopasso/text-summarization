(EW.com) -- After a day of giving thanks, eating turkey, and watching TV with the family, a common impulse is to get out of the house and go shopping. Just kidding! Instead of braving the Black Friday brawls, sit back and relax with even more TV marathons. (That's what Cyber Monday is for, isn't it?) Standouts include complete(-ish) sets of favorite franchises such as Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, and Star Trek, as well as guilty-pleasure reality series like House Hunters International and Say Yes to the Dress: Atlanta.
