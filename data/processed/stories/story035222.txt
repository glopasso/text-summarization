A blind South Korean tourist who speaks no English went missing after touring New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art -- prompting a search that ended happily, with him being found safe and sound, police said.
Taeheung Kim, 41, became separated from his tour late Thursday afternoon and was last seen by a security guard at 5 a.m. Friday in front of the museum, police said.
The Metropolitan Museum notes on its website the programs that it offers for the blind or otherwise visually impaired, including one called "seeing through drawing," a "touch collection" and "verbal imaging tours."
On Saturday, New York City police asked for the public's help in finding the man, whom they described as 5 feet 6 inches tall and legally blind.
They issued an update shortly before 6 p.m., saying Kim had "been located and is in good health."
Details on where he'd been and what he'd done since late Thursday afternoon were not immediately available.
A spokesman at the South Korean consulate in New York -- who asked not be named -- told CNN early Saturday evening that Kim had flown back home with his sister.
