A judge ruled Tuesday that a lawsuit from a former member of Lady Gaga's entourage who alleges the pop star failed to pay her overtime wages can move to trial.
Judge Paul G. Gardephe of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York set the trial date for November 4.
In her lawsuit, Jennifer O'Neill says that she worked "24/7" as Gaga's personal assistant.
O'Neill was employed in early 2009, and again from February 2010 to March 2011. After she was rehired, she was told her annual salary would be $75,000.
O'Neill is seeking to recover more than $350,000 in unpaid wages.
"Every day is a work day for her, so every day is a work day for the rest of us," she said, according to court documents.
"There is no, we're going to stay in, we're going to sleep. There is no, let's put on sweatpants and go out to the movies and be girlfriends. It doesn't work like that."
Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, testified that O'Neill "deserves every one of her $75,000 that we agreed to. But she does not deserve a penny more."
Representatives for the singer have told CNN the lawsuit is completely without merit.
