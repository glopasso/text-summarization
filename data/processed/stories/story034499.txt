A uniformed Philadelphia police officer seen in an online video striking a woman after he was hit by a liquid has been placed on administrative duty while the incident is investigated, a police spokeswoman said Tuesday.
The officer seen in the video, which was posted on YouTube, was identified as Lt. Jonathan Josey, Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien told CNN.
The video shows a crowd of people gathered around about a dozen officers handcuffing a man against a car at the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade on Sunday.
The woman, wearing a black shirt and jeans, is on the left side of the video and has a bottle in her left hand. The woman raises her left arm as she hops around behind one of the officers. Some liquid flies from the bottle at the police. The woman changes position and a man behind her tosses liquid at the police.
As the woman turns and retreats, an officer, now identified as Josey, walks quickly after her and appears to strike her in the face with his right hand. The woman is knocked to the ground.
Josey cuffs her and two other officers lead her away. She appears to have blood coming from her mouth.
Lt. Ray Evers, a spokesman for Philadelphia police, said the woman was charged with disorderly conduct.
Police didn't release the name of the woman.
Police asked witnesses who were at the parade to call 215-685-5056.
The video had 785,000 views and 6,000 comments by Tuesday afternoon.
