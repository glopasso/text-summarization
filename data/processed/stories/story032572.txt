(Mashable)  -- Sony has announced that it will drop the price of the PSP Go portable gaming system from $249 to $199 just in time for the holiday rush.
The price cut is already effective -- just check out any online retailer like Gamestop or Amazon and you'll see the device selling at its new price point.
It's a welcome change, and it makes the device more competitive with the Nintendo DSi ($149) and the iPod touch ($229 -- $399).
Given the capabilities of the device, $199 seems like the perfect price point.
The PSP targets the core gamer market, which is willing to pay a little bit more for impressive graphics than it would get on the DSi. Still, neither device is as dynamic as the iPod touch.
Sony boasts that the PSP has moved 61 million units since it debuted in 2004, but the various DS models have sold more than 140 million units in roughly the same time period.
The iPod Touch has sold at least 45 million since its 2007 launch -- and that's not counting iPhones, which play the same games.
