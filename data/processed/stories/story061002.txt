Israeli forces killed two militants in Gaza on Sunday morning, Palestinian officials said.
The forces said they saw suspects "planting explosives along the security fence along the southern Gaza Strip."
A spokesman for the forces confirmed the attacks, saying there were "direct hits," but did not provide the number of people killed.
Palestinian officials confirmed an exchange of fire occurred between Israeli forces and "Islamic jihad militants" east of Khan Younis.
Saraya al-Quds militants said in a statement that two of their fighters were killed.
