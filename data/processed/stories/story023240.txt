Sam Kane Beef Processors of Corpus Christi, Texas, has recalled 90,987 pounds of ground beef products after consumers complained about finding pieces of metal inside the meat, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Saturday.
The USDA said four consumers complained, with one person reporting a chipped tooth. The pieces of metal were reported to be about 3mm, a USDA press release said.
Alfred Bausch, general manager for the company, said all the products were shipped to Texas retail outlets.
"It was not a food safety issue," he said. "It was a foreign object and the foreign object was very small."
The press release said these products are subject to recall:
--3-pound packages of "HEB Ground Chuck," bearing the establishment number "337," a production date of "09/12/14" and a use by date of "10/02/14."
--5-pound packages of "HEB Ground Beef," "73% LEAN 27% FAT," bearing the establishment number "337," a production date of "09/15/14" and a use by date of "10/05/14."
--10-pound packages of "HEB Ground Beef," "73% LEAN 27% FAT," bearing the establishment number "337," a production date of "09/18/14" and a use by date of "10/08/14."
--10-pound clear film packages of formed patties made from Sam Kane Beef Processors "Ground Chuck," bearing the establishment number "337," a production date of "9/09/14" and a use by date of "9/29/14."
The USDA said the products bear the establishment number "337" inside the USDA mark of inspection.
The press release said this is a Class II recall, meaning "there is a remote probability of adverse health consequences from the use of the product."
The company website says Sam Kane Beef was founded in 1949. A group of Texas ranchers and cattlemen purchased the company in 2013, the website said.
