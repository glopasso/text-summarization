Alt-metal rockers Primus were never ones to do things the normal way, so why start now?
The band goes full "Willy Wonka" on us with their new release "Primus and the Chocolate Factory with the Fungi Ensemble." It's their take on the soundtrack from the 1971 film starring Gene Wilder.
In addition to digital downloads and CDs, the album is out on vinyl too. Nearly all of them are chocolate-colored, but five are gold vinyl.
And if you know anything about the movie, you know that means something special.
Anyone who gets one of them, wins free Primus concert tickets for life. It's not quite a tour of the chocolate factory, but for Primus fans it will do.
"Primus and the Chocolate Factory" reunites the band's classic lineup of bassist and singer Les Claypool, drummer Tim "Herb" Alexander and guitarist Larry LaLonde. It's their first full album together since 1995's "Tales from the Punch Bowl."
