Investigators have no suspect in the stabbing death of an 8-year-old girl in her California home Saturday, a law enforcement official said Sunday.
Leila Fowler's brother found the child with "severe injuries" in the Calaveras County, California, home Saturday, and she was pronounced dead later at a hospital, according to Calaveras County Sheriff Capt. Jim Macedo.
Her parents were "nearby at a public event" at the time, Macedo told reporters.
The brother, who was not named, "is not a suspect at this time, but we are continuing to talk to him, which would be normal because he was the last person with the child," he said.
Detectives are tracking down dozens of leads phoned into a tip line created Saturday, including some leading to other counties, he said.
A search of the family's home overnight Saturday gave investigators a "substantial amount of evidence," he said.
He would not describe how the girl was killed.
Witnesses have given police three differing descriptions of a possible intruder into the home, he said. The Sheriff's Office is not releasing any of those descriptions, Macedo said.
"We don't want to lead anybody in the wrong direction," he said.
A widespread search is being conducted for clues, he said.
Deputies will have an "increased and visible presence at the schools and bus stops" until the crime is solved, he said.
