Nine people were killed when a bus plunged over a cliff in southern Mexico on Monday night, officials said.
Another 30 people were injured, said Rafael Escobar, an official with the state of Mexico's health institute.
The crash took place in Villa del Carbon. Most of the passengers were pilgrims headed to the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City.
Escobar said the bus went over a cliff about 40 meters (131 feet) high.
