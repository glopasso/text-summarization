(EW.com) -- The CW has renewed "America's Next Top Model" for its 20th cycle since debuting in 2003.
With the new cycle comes two big changes for the competition show: This time it will premiere in summer 2013 instead of the typical early fall or late winter start. And the show will feature male models for the first time.

The male models will live in the models' house along with the female models, and all will compete for the title of "America's Next Top Model." No word from the CW yet about exactly how this affects the competition and its rules.
"America's Next Top Model" is currently in the midst of its 19th cycle, "College Edition."
