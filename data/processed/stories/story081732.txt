Actress Lindsay Lohan will be featured in the January/February issue of Playboy, a spokeswoman for the magazine said Monday.
The issue is expected to hit newsstands late December, Theresa Hennessey told CNN, declining to offer details.
The 25-year-old actress and model shot to fame for her roles in kid-friendly flicks like "The Parent Trap." But her rocky personal life, which is standard fodder for tabloids, has overshadowed her career in recent years.
Lohan was released from jail early Monday, just hours after she was booked in, authorities said.
Last week, a Los Angeles County judge ordered Lohan to serve a 30-day jail term after she admitted she violated her probation on a necklace theft conviction.
At the time, Los Angeles County Sheriff spokesman Steve Whitmore said it was likely Lohan could be booked in and booked out the same day.
"It depends on the fluctuations of the day, what's going on in the jail," Whitmore said.
The actress must work at least 12 days a month at the county morgue until she completes the 53 remaining days on her court-ordered community service, Judge Stephanie Sautner told her. Lohan must also attend 18 psychotherapy sessions.
The actress also made headlines last month, when photographs surfaced showing Lohan with less-than-perfect teeth.
Her representative, Steve Honig, shot back then, telling CNN: "Lindsay is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful women on the planet, and is regularly sought after by some of the top photographers in the world to appear on covers of magazines around the globe."
