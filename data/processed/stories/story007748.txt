(EW.com) -- Robert Schwentke, the German director best known for Flightplan with Jodie Foster and the successful action-comedy "Red," has been selected to direct "Insurgent," the sequel to Summit's upcoming franchise-starter, "Divergent."
Shailene Woodley stars as multi-talented Tris Prior in the adaptation of Veronica Roth's best-selling novel, which tells the story of a dystopian future where society is divided into five factions. In "Insurgent," based on Roth's 2012 book, war looms and Tris' loyalty to Dauntless, the most courageous faction, is tested in ways she never imagined.
"We are excited to announce that we have found the perfect director to carry on the story of Tris Prior and the expanded world of Insurgent in Robert Schwentke," said Erik Feig, Lionsgate's president of production, in a statement. "Robert, with whom we have already had a successful relationship, has proven a master storyteller in multiple genres."
Divergent, which also stars Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoe Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, Mekhi Phifer, and Kate Winslet, was directed by Neil Burger. It opens in theaters on March 21. "Insurgent" is already slotted for March 20, 2015.
Schwentke's last movie was an expensive flop. "R.I.P.D," starring Jeff Bridges and Ryan Reynolds cost a reported $130 million to make and grossed only $33.6 million at the box office.
