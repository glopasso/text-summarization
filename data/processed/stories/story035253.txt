With Snoop Dogg bowing out of his feud with Iggy Azalea, it seems Eminem is more than willing to take his place.
In a leaked snippet from a new Eminem song called "Vegas," the controversial rapper appears to tell Iggy to put away her "rape whistle."
"Unless you're Nicki/grab you by the wrist let's ski/so what's it gon be/put that s**t away Iggy/You don't wanna blow that rape whistle on me," Eminem raps.
Those lyrics come on the heels of Em taking shots at singer Lana Del Rey in a freestyle, saying that he'd punch her "right in the face twice" like NFL player Ray Rice, who was suspended from the league after he was seen on video knocking his then-fiance unconscious.
That kind of lyricism isn't surprising from Eminem, whose rhymes have been called homophobic in addition to misogynistic and violent. The rapper has explained in the past that the words he puts on wax are part of the "personas that I create in my music."
To Iggy Azalea, that approach is not only offensive, but uninspired.
"I'm bored of the old men threatening young women as entertainment trend and much more interested in the young women getting $ trend," the Australian artist tweeted on Thursday. "It's especially awkward because my 14 year old brother is the biggest eminem fan and now the artist he admired says he wants to rape me. nice!"
Besides, she adds, "women in music have the bigger b***s anyhow."
Iggy is right that she's come up against a wave of criticism as her star power continues to rise. Last month, she went toe-to-toe with Snoop Dogg when the California rapper posted a series of mean-spirited photos and comments about the "Fancy" rapper, including calling her a "f****ng c**t."
It wasn't until he had a chat with rapper T.I. that Snoop decided to fold on the feud, and offered Iggy an apology.
