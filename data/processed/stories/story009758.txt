(CNN)"Doctor Strange" is adding to the mix.
The Marvel movie, slated for release in 2016, finally landed Benedict Cumberbatch as the mysterious title character. Now it appears that Oscar-nominated actor Chiwetel Ejiofor may be joining the cast, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
The Tinseltown trade paper says that Ejiofor is in negotiations for an "unspecified role."
"Strange" fans are already chattering about what that role could be.
If Ejiofor does join the cast, he'll be reunited with Cumberbatch, who was one of his co-stars in "12 Years a Slave." Ejiofor was nominated for a best actor Oscar for his performance as Solomon Northup, the protagonist of last year's best picture.
Of course, there's still a long time between now and November 4, 2016, "Strange's" proposed release date, and negotiations with Cumberbatch were rumored for months before being confirmed.
Magical casting? We'll see.
