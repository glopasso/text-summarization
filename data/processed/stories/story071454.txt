A dramatic injury-time goal by Juan Mata handed Chelsea a 2-1 victory over Wigan in the English Premier League on Saturday to boost their chances of qualifying for next season's Champions League.
All three goals came in the second half with Branislav Ivanovic opening the scoring Chelsea in the 62nd minute.
Wigan's French midfielder Mohamed Diame looked to have salvaged a point for the second-from-bottom side when he scored in the 82nd minute.
But Juan Mata's goal which came after Fernando Torres' shot hit the post saw the Blues rise to fifth, now two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.
Tottenham Hotspur moved up to third place with a 0-0 draw against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light but Arsenal can overtake them again if they get a result against Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.
League leaders Manchester United are also in action Sunday as they host Queens Park Rangers.

The point lifts Liverpool to eighth with 43 points. Villa remain in 15th place with 34 points.
