Robin Thicke isn't giving up on his marriage to Paula Patton.
The couple, married since 2005, mutually decided to separate in February, and since then singer Thicke has been trying to win her back with his performances.
It was speculated that Thicke might try such a gesture during his set at the Billboard Music Awards on Sunday. Sure enough, the R&B crooner appeared to make a not-so-veiled reference to his romantic life with a performance of "Get Her Back" during the ceremony.
The new single has lyrics such as "all I want to do is make it right" and, "I miss you, I miss you so much, baby/I just want you to come back home."
While Thicke never mentioned Patton by name during the performance, he did thank his "wife" for "her love and support and for putting up with me all these years" during an acceptance speech for Top R&B song.
That also wouldn't be the first time Thicke's tried such a maneuver. Not long after the couple announced their separation,Thicke took the stage in Virginia and dedicated his hit "Lost Without You" to his wife. "I'm trying to get my girl back," he told the crowd. "She's a good woman."
According to People magazine, Thicke's taking his tour of love to Tuesday night's "The Voice" finale as well.
Patton, for her part, has been somewhat more demure about the couple's status.
When Vanity Fair wanted to know if her relationship with Thicke had reached its end, the actress vaguely replied, "We've known each other since we were teenagers. All I can tell you is there's a deep love there -- always was, and always will be."
