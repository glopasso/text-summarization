(CNNGO) -- Money's worth nothing, until you spend it.
That's the philosophy behind all extravagant luxury goods, and nothing says "senseless overspending" like blowing thousands on a place to sleep, shower and store your clothes while you go about your day.

US$10,000 per night

At more than 371 square meters, The Peninsula suite, on the 26th floor, provides the most stunning vistas over Victoria Harbour, along with a 24-hour butler and chauffeur service, mini-gym and fully equipped kitchen.
