(CNN)Millions played -- and prayed.
But no one got all the six life-changing numbers: 5, 10, 21, 34, 58 and the Powerball, 33. The next drawing is Wednesday, and the estimated jackpot now shoots up to $450 million.
It's now among the largest jackpots and inching closer to the biggest in Powerball history: $590.5 million won in 2013
Meanwhile, here's some mathematical reality: you don't stand a chance.
We know, we know -- someone may get at least a share of the prize. If not this one, then in a subsequent drawing.
Chances of it being you? Virtually nonexistent.
The chance of a ticket winning a Powerball jackpot is 1 in 175,223,510. You have a better chance of becoming an astronaut, dating a supermodel -- maybe even being attacked by a shark or struck by lightning --  the latter two simultaneously.
But hey, dream on!
We will, too.
