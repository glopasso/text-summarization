Colombia opened their Copa America campaign with a victory on Saturday, defeating 10-man Costa Rica 1-0 in Jujuy.
The 2001 champions went top of Group A courtesy of a goal on the stroke of half-time from Hertha Berlin striker Adrian Ramos.
Costa Rica had a mountain to climb once they lost a player in the 27th minute --- winger Randall Brenes shown a straight red card for a bad foul on Amaranto Perea.

Young goalkeeper Leonel Moreira kept the Colombia attack at bay but was unable to do anything about the goal, with Ramos beating him to a pinpoint through-ball from Freddy Guarin.
Colombia continued to creat chances after the break, with Ramos and Hugo Rodallega both denied by Moreira, while Radamel Falcao headed against the crossbar from close range.
"It's great to start off with a win -- it's a real confidence boost," Ramos told reporters.
"We were good in parts and bad in parts too, but the important thing was to win," added the 25-year-old.
The result lifts Colmbia to the top of the group ahead of host nation Argentina and Bolivia -- who drew 1-1 in Friday's opening match.
