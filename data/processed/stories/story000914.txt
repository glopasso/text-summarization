Some samples of designer Marc Jacobs' fashions for next year disappeared on the way from Paris to London by train this week, forcing the company to cancel Thursday's press day in London, the company said.
"The Marc Jacobs PR team is sorry to inform you that our press day tomorrow in the Marc Jacobs store is canceled, due to the theft of the spring/summer 2012 collections during its transfer from Paris," the company said in an e-mail sent Wednesday to fashion publications.
Fashion editors attend the press days to see samples they'll use for photo shoots as part of their coverage of what's coming to stores in the future.
A highly placed source in the Jacobs company, who asked not to be identified, said the apparent theft was not unusual for the fashion business.
Contrary to some reports, only a part of the collection is missing, the source said.
Paris police said they have not been contacted to investigate.
CNN's Alina Cho and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.
