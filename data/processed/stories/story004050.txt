Three members of a suburban Boston junior varsity boys' soccer team were arrested Friday in connection with an alleged sexual assault at a sports camp, according to authorities.
The assaults occurred last Sunday at Camp Lenox near Otis, a town in western Massachusetts, according to the Berkshire District Attorney's Office.
The city of Somerville, just northwest of Boston, rented the facility for team-building activities for its fall sports teams.
According to prosecutors, the three Somerville High School students allegedly entered a cabin occupied by freshman students and assaulted three victims.
The eldest of the three juniors, a 17-year-old male, faces charges that include aggravated rape of a child under 16, indecent assault and battery on a person who has turned 14, assault and battery and intimidation of a witness.
The two other male athletes, both 16, face similar allegations, prosecutors said in a statement.
The allegations were reported to members of the Somerville High School athletic department on Tuesday. A criminal investigation began immediately, officials said.
In a joint statement, Somerville's mayor and schools superintendent said, "We are disturbed and appalled that these crimes may have taken place and our thoughts and concerns are with the victims and their families."
Mayor Joseph A. Curtatone and Superintendent Tony Pierantozzi said the district attorney's office has given no indication that any other students were implicated. The alleged assaults appear to be a "single, isolated incident."
Support services are available to help victims, parents and team members who attended the camp.
