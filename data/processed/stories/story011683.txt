Shock and sadness etched the faces of residents in northeastern Wisconsin as daylight on Monday revealed the damage left behind by a powerful storm that cut a swath through the state.
An emergency declaration has been made for the city of Kaukauna, where early estimates were that 157 homes had been either damaged or destroyed Sunday night, the city's police chief said.
City officials, including the police, fire, planning and utility departments, went out in four teams for the morning assessment.
"This tornado, what we believe is a tornado, moved through, hit the back of houses, jumped over the front of those, then hit the front of the houses homes and hit the front of the houses on the other side of the street," said Kaukauna Police Chief John Manion.
Despite the damage estimates, which officials believe will grow, no injuries were reported in Kaukauna from the storm.
"People were well warned," Manion said. "That contributes to life."
Kaukauna is about 20 miles southwest of Green Bay.
Authorities in Lincoln County, in northern Wisconsin, did a door-to-door search after the Sunday night storm.
At least 25 homes suffered severe damage, said Mark Handlin of the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office. The worst damage was north of Merrill, about 170 miles north-northwest of Milwaukee, he said.
Crews are working to clear downed trees and power lines, Handlin said. A shelter has been set up at a motel.
Two residents were airlifted to a larger regional hospital because of the extent of their injuries, said Brian Sladek, director of Lincoln County emergency management. Other minor injuries were reported.
