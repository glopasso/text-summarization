Carol, a 39-year-old circus elephant wounded in a drive-by shooting, is expected to make a full recovery.
She was shot on the grounds of BancorpSouth Arena, in Tupelo, Mississippi, while on tour with "The Greatest Show on Earth."
"It appeared to be a deliberate, targeted event," said Capt. Rusty Haynes, with the Tupelo police.
Authorities are looking for a silver or white Ford Explorer that was seen in the area at the time of the shooting, around 2 a.m. Tuesday.
Haynes said Carol, an Asian elephant, was struck on her neck, between her shoulder and ear.
A reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in the case has climbed to $24,000.
A part of that money is coming from the U.S. government, as Asian elephants are endangered, Haynes said.
Carol will spend several weeks in Missouri convalescing.
"I have no idea why anyone in the world would want to do something so malicious or stupid," the police captain said Wednesday.
"It makes no sense to me whatsoever."
Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus is scheduled to open in Tupelo on Thursday. It bills itself as "The Greatest Show on Earth."
