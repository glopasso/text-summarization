Former "Jersey Shore" star Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino will get anger management counseling to settle an assault charge connected to a tanning salon fight with a brother, his lawyer said.
Sorrentino, 31, reached a plea deal with the Middletown, New Jersey, prosecutor allowing him to face a reduced municipal code charge if he completes 12 weeks of private counseling, attorney Edward Fradkin said.
The reality show star appeared in court Monday, when the judge approved the deal, Fradkin said. He will return in three months and enter a plea to a non-criminal ordinance violation after the counseling, he said.
The fight happened inside a tanning salon Sorrentino co-owns with his brother.
"The Situation" told a photographer after his arrest that the fight happened because his brother "was not running the store correctly, so I had to go in there and clean house, in more ways than one."
Sorrentino, who appeared in six seasons of the MTV reality series "Jersey Shore," emerged from a stint in drug rehab two years ago declaring that he was a changed man.
