Brazil have moved to the top of South American qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals after thrashing Uruguay 4-0 in Montevideo, their first victory in the country for 33 years.
Brazil players celebrate Juan's second goal in their 4-0 thrashing of Uruguay.
Barcelona full-back Daniel Alves gave them an 11th-minute lead with a speculative long-range effort that goalkeeper Sebastian Viera allowed to bounce over him and into the net.
Roma defender Juan headed home the second goal 10 minutes before the interval and Sevilla's Luis Fabiano added a third early in the second half, although he was later sent off.
In-demand AC Milan playmaker Kaka completed the victory from the penalty spot after he had been fouled in the area.
The win sees Brazil move onto 24 points, level with former leaders Paraguay who relinquished top spot after a shock 2-0 home defeat at the hands of Chile.
Goals from Matias Fernandez in the 12th minute and Humberto Suazo in the 50th gave Chile a crucial win, lifting them up to third place -- just a single point off the top two.
Argentina complete the top four, another point behind on 22 points, after a 56th-minute Daniel Diaz goal gave them a 1-0 home victory over Colombia in Buenos Aires.
With only the leading four teams guaranteed a place in South Africa next year, fifth-placed Uruguay now appear to have a mountain to climb, as they trail Argentina by five points with just five matches remaining.
The fifth-placed team will have North America's fourth-placed side in a play-off for the remaining World Cup qualification place.
