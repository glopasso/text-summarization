The mother of champion boxer Hector "Macho" Camacho probably will make a decision on Saturday about whether to remove her son from life support, she told reporters Friday night.
"For me, he's not alive," Maria Matias told reporters in Puerto Rico.
But one of the boxer's sons, Hector "Machito" Camacho Jr., said his father is alive and "is going to fight until the end,"
Matias said she will make the final decision on her son's life.
The famed Puerto Rican boxer was shot in the face Tuesday and on Thursday was declared clinically brain dead.
A passing gunman shot Camacho, who was in car in front of a bar in his hometown of Bayamon, Puerto Rico.
Camacho, a former lightweight and junior lightweight champion, was in the passenger seat of the car, police said. The driver was shot twice and killed, they said.
The suspects are two men who are believed to have been traveling in a gray vehicle, said Lt. Wilfredo Rivera of CataÃ±o Police. They escaped after a shootout with police at a residential complex, WAPA TV reported.
During his career, Camacho, 50, awed fans with his quick hands and ring antics, developing a reputation for flamboyance. He also battled a series of legal issues that stemmed from drugs and other problems.
A southpaw, Camacho fought professionally for more than 25 years and last stepped into the ring in 2010.
He had a career record of 79 wins, six losses and three draws.
