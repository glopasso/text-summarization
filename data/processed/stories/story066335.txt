Notch this up to Swedes and another ridiculously cool, innovative design.
This latest effort can be found off an African island and straightaway is placed high on that list of 'amazing hotels I wish i could get to' many travelers have.
Just off the coast of Tanzania, The Manta Resort on Pemba Island has added a beautiful, other-worldly underwater bedroom to their original 16-room offering.
The new 'digs' opened for business this month, designed by Swedish company Genberg Underwater Hotels.
They are the brains behind the The Utter Inn, an underwater room in the middle of a Swedish lake which was also one of our 15 unusual places to spend the night.
Lying approximately 250 meters offshore, the latest underwater structure is a three-story affair, with a rooftop deck, a bathroom and a lounge area at sea level and finally the bedroom downstairs, with the fish.
At night, spotlights under the windows attract and illuminate squid and octopus -- a more reclusive crowd than the daytime sea life.
The resort is popular with divers owing to the coral reef around the island.
