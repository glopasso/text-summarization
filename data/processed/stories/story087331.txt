Formula One will pay its respects to the 239 people who went missing aboard Flight 370 ahead of this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.
The plane disappeared almost three weeks ago, with Malaysian Airlines informing the relatives of those who were on board that it had to be assumed "beyond reasonable doubt" that the aircraft was lost and there were no survivors.
Before the race at the Sepang Circuit, teams, drivers and officials are planning a host of tributes to the passengers. The race track neighbors Kuala Lumpur's main airport where the plane took off on March 8.
F1 officials and race organizers were due to meet on Thursday to discuss how best to honor those thought lost in the tragedy.
But Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton has already tweeted a picture of his car bearing the hashtag "#PrayForMH370" along with the message: "All my prayers and sympathies go to the friends and families of the passengers on MH370 flight."
Sunday's race will be the second of the 2014 season, with Hamilton's teammate Nico Rosberg looking for his second win after taking the checkered flag at the Australian Grand Prix.
It was a disappointing start to the year for four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel, who was forced to retire after three laps of the Melbourne opener.
However there was better news for the German on Wednesday when he was named Laureus Sportsman of the Year.
The Red Bull driver was given the award after wrapping up a fourth consecutive drivers' title in 2013.
The women's honor went to American swimmer Missy Franklin, who won a record six gold medals at last year's world championships in Barcelona.
