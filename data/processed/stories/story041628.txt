A Molotov cocktail was tossed at an Islamic center in one of three attacks in New York City, authorities said early Monday.
The three attacks in Queens were at a bodega, Islamic center and a private house on Sunday night.
Molotov cocktails were used in all the attacks, resulting in some damage, but no injuries, the New York Police Department said.
In a fourth incident, a fire damaged part of house, but it was too early to tell whether it was a result of a Molotov cocktail or whether it's related to the other incidents, police said.
An investigation is ongoing.
