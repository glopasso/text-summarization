European football's governing body UEFA will investigate alleged incidents of racist chanting at two Euro 2012 matches, it was announced on Tuesday.
The two games in question are Sunday's 1-1 draw between Spain and Italy in Gdansk, Ukraine, and Russia's 4-1 win over Czech Republic in the Polish city of Wroclaw on Friday
"Following the provision of new independent information regarding the two cases of alleged racist chanting in the Spain-Italy and Russia-Czech Republic matches, UEFA is now conducting further investigations," said a UEFA spokesman.
"There are, however, no disciplinary proceedings opened at this moment in time."
The issue of racism has threatened to overshadow the four-yearly tournament, which is being co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine.
Members of the Dutch squad claimed to hear monkey noises during an open training session in Krakow, Poland, last week, though the Dutch FA opted not to lodge an official complaint with UEFA.
In addition, family members of two black England players chose not to travel to the competition for fear of being subjected to racism.
UEFA has already taken the step of writing a letter to the mayors of each host city asking for a zero-tolerance approach to racist abuse.
In addition to the latest developments, Russia also came under scrutiny over the conduct of their fans following reported unrest during the Czech Republic match.
On Monday, the Russian Football Federation issued a plea for good behavior to it's supporters at the tournament.
