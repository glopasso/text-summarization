BARCELONA, Spain -- Barcelona's Brazilian forward Ronaldinho will miss most of the rest of the season after damaging a muscle in his right leg during training on Friday.
Ronaldinho has had his least impressive season with Barcelona since joining them in 2003.
The club announced that the injury would keep him on the sidelines for about six weeks.
The 28-year-old Ronaldinho, twice world player of the year, has had his least impressive season with Barcelona since joining them from Paris St Germain in 2003 and has frequently been linked with a possible move away.
