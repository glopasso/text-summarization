A North Carolina man was arrested on suspicion of attempting to carry explosives through a security checkpoint at an airport in Midland, Texas, federal authorities said.
Trey Scott Atwater of Hope Mills was taken into federal custody Saturday morning after Transportation Security Administration agents spotted what they described as a suspicious item.
The item was in his carry-on during X-ray screening at a security checkpoint at Midland International Airport, FBI spokesman Mark Morgan said in a statement.
Neither the FBI nor the TSA identified the explosives, though a Midland spokeswoman said the items were "wrapped in military grade wrapping" and are in the possession of the Midland Police Department.
"At no time was there any danger to the people at Midland International Airport or the community of Midland, Texas," Morgan said.
The airport terminal was temporarily evacuated while authorities "conducted a sweep, and deemed all clear," said Tasa Watts, the city spokeswoman.
Atwater has been arrested on a federal count of attempting to get on an aircraft with an explosive, Morgan said.
