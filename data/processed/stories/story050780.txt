(CNN)A University of Kentucky basketball player is apologizing for the "poor choice of words" he muttered under his breath after the team's stunning loss to Wisconsin on Saturday.
As a deflated panel of Wildcats fielded a reporter's question about Wisconsin standout Frank Kaminsky, a hot mic picked up Kentucky guard Andrew Harrison saying of Kaminsky, "F**k that (N-word)."
Harrison, who is is black, said his words were "in jest," and that he meant no disrespect to Kaminsky, who is white.
"First I want to apologize for my poor choice of words used in jest towards a player I respect and know," Harrison tweeted. "When I realized how this could be perceived I immediately called big frank to apologize and let him know I didn't mean any disrespect."
Kaminsky -- the 2015 Associated Press player of the year -- said Sunday that he was "over it."
"He reached out to me. We talked about it. [I'm] Over it," he said. "Nothing needs to be made out of it."
Harrison said he wished Kaminsky well in Monday's national title game against Duke.
"We had a good conversation, and I wished him good luck in the championship game Monday."
CNN reached out to Kentucky for comment on Sunday but did not hear back.
