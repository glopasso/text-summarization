Since the infidelity scandal that took down the CIA chief David Petraeus broke last Friday, a scattered timeline of bizarre events have captivated, if not confused, the public.
There is his mistress and biographer, Paula Broadwell. Then there is Jill Kelley, the Florida woman whose claim about anonymous e-mails questioning her character triggered an FBI probe that uncovered the Broadwell-Petraeus affair.
Finally, there is Gen. John Allen, the man who commands U.S. forces in Afghanistan and whose nomination to become the NATO Supreme Allied Commander of Europe is now in question.
Confused? Maybe laying it out -- by the numbers -- will help:
4 - Number of stars, as a general, with which Petraeus retired.
38 - Four-star officers in the U.S. military, as of August 2012.
2 - Number of generals involved in the scandal.
5 - In which top percentage of his West Point class Petraeus graduated.
38 - Years Petraeus and his wife Holly have been married.
22 - Current and former directors of the Central Intelligence Agency.
197 - Amazon.com sales rank of Broadwell's book "All In: The Education of General David Petraeus" on Wednesday.
76,792 - Previous rank on Amazon.com before the scandal made the news.
20,000-30,000 - Number of documents -- many of them e-mails between Allen and Kelley -- that investigators are reviewing.
7,969 - Number of U.S. government requests for data on Gmail.com user accounts, according to a Google transparency report covering January to June of 2012.
6 - Number of minutes in which Petraeus and Broadwell were reportedly able to finish each mile on their runs together.
0 - Number of active "Friends of MacDill" Air Force Base visitor passes currently held by Kelley.
