MADRID, Spain -- Barcelona's Brazil forward Ronaldinho was granted dual nationality by Spain on Monday, the Primera Liga club said.
Brazilian striker Ronaldinho leaves Gava magistrates court in Spain after being granted dual nationality.
The move frees up a place for another non-European Union player in Frank Rijkaard's squad.
Mexican forward Giovani dos Santos is set to take up the vacant slot alongside Cameroon international Samuel Eto'o and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure in the non-EU berths permitted under Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) rules.
However, Dos Santos is also expected to be granted dual nationality this week.
