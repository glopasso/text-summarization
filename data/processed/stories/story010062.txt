Two people died Tuesday when a single-engine plane crashed into a recreational vehicle park near North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a local official said.
The crash killed the plane's pilot and a woman inside a trailer at Briarcliffe RV Resort, according to North Myrtle Beach Public Information Officer Pat Dowling. The woman's husband was standing outside the trailer when the impact happened around 1 p.m. ET. He was taken to a hospital, Dowling said.
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the airplane was a Cessna 172.
The pilot had been coming in for a landing at nearby Grand Strand Regional Airport, Dowling said.
RV park member Cliff Douglas told CNN affiliate WBTW that he was inside his vehicle playing with his grandson when he heard the airplane's engine "screaming full tilt" overhead.
"Almost instantaneously you heard the impact," he said.
Dowling said neither of the dead had been identified.
