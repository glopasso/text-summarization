Thought the 111 million people tuning into the Super Bowl was a lot?
Try six times that.
More than 700 million watched China's five-hour long Lunar New Year TV gala this year, according to China's state television network.
The Lunar New Year also dwarfed the Super Bowl on social media.
Although internet users set a new Twitter record with more than 381,605 tweets about the Super Bowl during one minute, it was nothing compared to Chinese internet users, who used the social network QQ to send 32.7 million messages in one minute during the Chinese holiday.
Another Chinese social media app, WeChat, said its users sent 10 million messages in one minute on Lunar New Year.
This year, WeChat introduced a popular new feature allowing its users to send traditional "lucky money" to each other online.
In recent years, Chinese social media use has seen a dramatic rise, as users take to the internet to talk about everything from celebrities to politics to their personal lives.
According to statistics from the official China Internet Network Information Center, there are nearly 600 million internet users in China today. The U.S. has 254 million, according to the Harvard Business Review.
