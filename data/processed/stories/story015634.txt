Brad Drewett is the new head of men's tennis after being appointed as the ATP Tour's executive chairman on Thursday.
The London-based Australian, 53, will have a three-year tenure starting January 1 as successor to American Adam Helfant, who decided to stand down after a similar term.
"I am honored to have this opportunity to lead the ATP, an organization that I am proud to have been a part of since the beginning of my professional playing career," said Drewett, a former player who has run the tour's flagship season-ending event since 2001.

"The ATP World Tour and men's tennis are stronger than ever and it is my intention to continue to lead the organization on this successful path, working hand in hand with our players and tournaments. I am very excited about the opportunities ahead."
World No. 3 Roger Federer, who is head of the players' council, welcomed the promotion of the former head of the ATP's International Group.
"Brad is a very experienced executive and has been an effective leader within the ATP for many years," the 16-time grand slam champion said.
"He understands the global nature of the business as well as the complexities of dealing with all of the tour's stakeholders. I am confident that Brad's work ethic and leadership will help contribute to the continued success of the ATP World Tour."
Drewett won two junior Australian Open titles before reaching a career-high ranking of 34th.
He was elected to represent players on the ATP board before moving into the business side, and took the tour finals to Shanghai and before rebranding it in London in 2009.
