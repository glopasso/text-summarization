A California family's nanny nightmare may be nearing an end.
More than three weeks ago the Bracamonte family fired Diane Stretton, 64, but she refused to leave their home. Police told the family they couldn't force Stretton out of their Upland, California, home without an eviction notice.
A judge even ruled in Stretton's favor, deciding the Bracamonte's did not terminate Stretton's employment in a legal manner. The family said Stretton then threatened to sue them if they tried to force her out.
Now Stretton has offered to move out, according to ABC News, but under her conditions. Stretton called the family's attorney late Saturday night "and said she could be out by July 4," Marcella Bracamonte said on "Good Morning America" Sunday. But Bracamonte said that won't work for her family because they plan to be out of town.
So it's still unclear at this point if, in fact, the nanny will leave of her own free will or whether the family will have to continue through with the eviction process, now underway, before they can call their home their own again.
"This is now by court, by law, this is her domain, " Ralph Bracamonte told ABC News.
The family's saga started in March when Marcella Bracamonte hired Stretton as a nanny, who was expected to help out with household chores. The family ran a background check on the woman before hiring her, too.
Bracamonte fired her on June 6.
"She quit working about a month before I ever fired her. She would just stay in her room," said Marcella Bracamonte.
CNN discovered that Stretton is on the California's Vexatious Litigant List, a list of people who continually bring legal action, regardless of merit, against others with the sole intention of harassment. CNN found dozens of lawsuits filed by Stretton in California over the years.
