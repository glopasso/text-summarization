Michael Turner, a star running back for the Atlanta Falcons, has been charged with driving under the influence of alcohol after being clocked at 97 mph on an Atlanta-area interstate, police said Tuesday.
Turner, 30, nicknamed "The Burner" because of his speed on the football field, was driving a black Audi R8 in a 65-mph zone on northbound Interstate 85 around 4 a.m. Tuesday, the Gwinnett County Sheriff's Department said. An officer pulled him over, and after smelling alcohol and investigating further, he charged Turner with DUI and speeding, the Sheriff's Department said.
Turner was released from the Gwinnett County Jail around 7 a.m. after posting a $2,179 bond, according to the Sheriff's Department.
In a statement, the Falcons said, "We are aware of the situation involving Michael and are in the process of gathering more information. Because this is now a legal matter, the club will have no further comment at this time."
Turner's touchdown several hours earlier had helped the Falcons defeat the Denver Broncos 27-21 on the nationally televised Monday Night Football game played in Atlanta's Georgia Dome.
Since Turner joined the Falcons in 2008, he has been one of the most prolific runners in the National Football League. He has led the National Football Conference in rushing yards the past two seasons.
