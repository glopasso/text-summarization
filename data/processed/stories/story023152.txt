(EW.com) -- FX has given the greenlight to "The Bridge," a thriller starring Diane Kruger ("Inglorious Basterds") and Demian Bichir ("A Better Life") and from Meredith Stiehm, a "Homeland" writer known for penning some of the series' most acclaimed episodes.
Based on the Scandinavian series "Bron," "The Bridge" is about a body found on the border of Texas and Mexico and the investigation that ensues. The 13-episode first season will go into production in April for a July premiere on FX.
This news means that Stiehm will likely have to leave the Showtime hit for her new FX series.
"I think it's one or the other," Stiehm told EW in January about choosing between Homeland and "The Bridge." "It's a high-cost problem. It's so hard to get your own series but, at the same time, What kind of idiot leaves 'Homeland' right now?"
