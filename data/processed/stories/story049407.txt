Real Madrid midfielder Kaka is facing a spell of up to four months on the sidelines after undergoing knee surgery, the Spanish club have confirmed.
The Brazil star had been with Jose Mourinho's side on their pre-season tour of the United States but left their base in Los Angeles to travel to see a knee specialist in Belgium.
Kaka had a disappointing World Cup with his country, as they were knocked out in the quarterfinal by Netherlands, and was troubled by a groin injury during the tournament in South Africa.
He joined Real Madrid from Italian giants AC Milan in June 2009 for a then world record fee of $88 million but only made 22 appearances as his new club finished second to champions Barcelona.
The half hour operation in Antwerp on Thursday morning was hailed as a success but Real fans may have to wait until December to see the 28-year-old back in action.
A statement on the club's official website read: "The operation performed on the left knee of Real Madrid C.F.'s Ricardo Izecson Dos Santos Leite 'Kaka' by Dr. Marc Martens at Antwerp's AZ Monica Hospital was a success.
"The arthroscopic surgery confirmed an injury to the left meniscus with minimal inflammation of the cartilage. The player is expected to miss three to four months."
Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner as Real Madrid beat Mexican side Club America 3-2 on their warm up tour of the U.S. and afterwards Mourinho told reporters the club could cope in Kaka's absence.
"It's no big deal if we have to lose him for a while," he said. "We have other players and that is that. He is one of the best players in the world.
"Kaka is loved by all his teammates and he is an excellent player, but we want him to be 100 per cent so that he is happy."
Real Madrid begin their quest to deny Barcelona a third straight Spanish title away to Mallorca on August 29.
