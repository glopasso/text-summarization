Call it a political "fumble."
Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, who's fighting for his political survival against independent candidate Greg Orman, got a highly coveted endorsement last week from Kansas State football coach Bill Snyder, who appeared in a 30-second ad for Roberts.
But days later Snyder apologized for appearing in the ad.
"I made a mistake," he said at a press conference Saturday after Kansas State's football game against Oklahoma State. "I'm not going to delve into exactly how everything happened, but I made a mistake and I embarrassed the university and that's my responsibility and that was my error."

"I'm not going to speak to it anymore right now, but that's my fault and nobody else's," he added. Asked if he wanted the ad taken down, he said "yes."
Snyder didn't explain how he got involved with the ad.
"He is as good as it gets for the state of Kansas," Snyder said in the spot.
Video for the ad was shot on Kansas State's campus, according to the Topeka Capital-Journal. The Capital-Journal also reported that Kansas State President Kirk Schulz said Roberts' campaign refused to grant the university's request to have the ad taken down.
