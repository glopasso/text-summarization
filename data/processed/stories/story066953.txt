(EW.com) -- Truly, ''D--- in a Box'' is the gift that keeps on giving for the Lonely Island, the nom de fake rap of "Saturday Night Live" star Andy Samberg and his BFFs, "SNL" writer-directors Jorma Taccone and Akiva Schaffer.
EW.com: Andy Samberg to host Shark Week. Can he top Craig Ferguson?
Since that brilliant, indisputably instructive R&B satire first appeared in 2006, the trio -- along with featured players like Rihanna, T-Pain, and a very game Justin Timberlake -- has had remarkable success in the notoriously difficult genre of ''funny music,'' hitting a neat balance of parody and sweet-natured homage (peppered with plenty of references to their respective junk).
Now, two years after "Incredibad," a debut that collected many of the group's greatest, previously televised hits, comes "Turtleneck & Chain," a perfectly acceptibad follow-up.
EW.com: 'SNL' skit men The Lonely Island reveal new album cover, guests Justin Timberlake, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj and more
On ''Motherlover,'' honorary Islander Timberlake returns for a deeply filthy, proudly MILF-y ode to ''pushing that way where you came out as a baby,'' while the triumphantly goofy ''I Just Had Sex,'' with Akon, manages to be both outrageous and entirely plausible radio bait.
EW.com: Michael Bolton returns to 'SNL' after 20 years: Best thing he did in between appearances?
Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, a sleepy, maybe-not-in-on-the-joke Snoop Dogg, and ''major cinephile'' Michael Bolton(!) all make appearances -- but it's the chameleonic core trio that truly surprises. At one point, over a classic, adrenalized hip-hop beat, Samberg and Taccone trade fierce criminology rhymes with a swagger that's downright serious.
Until, of course, one notices the title: ''Trouble on Dookie Island.''
