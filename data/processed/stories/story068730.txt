(CNN)It's a restaurant so exclusive and so extravagant that even the scofflaws who broke in and robbed it have discerning, sophisticated palates.
The French Laundry, the oh-so chichi Napa Valley landmark with its three Michelin stars and wine list that reads like porn for oenophiles, is suffering from bottle shock after its wine cellar was raided on Christmas Day.
"Specific wines of specific value were stolen," tweeted French Laundry's owner, the culinary demigod Thomas Keller.
Seventy-six bottles, with a total worth of about $300,000, were stolen from the Yountville restaurant, according to CNN affiliate KPIX.
Keller singled out two wines in particular: Screaming Eagle, a local Cabernet Sauvignon that can run as much as $6,500 a bottle, and Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, a French wine he sells between $6,000 and $8,000 per bottle, depending on the vintage.
"We are confident that if/when any stolen bottles appear in public they will immediately raise red flags," he said.
