(CNN)  -- Wladimir Klitschko will take a hefty weight advantage into his world heavyweight title unification match against David Haye in Hamburg Saturday.
The Ukrainian tipped the scales at 17st 4lb, while Britain's Haye came in at 15st 2lbs, over two stones lighter.
Haye, a former cruiserweight champion, will be putting his WBA title on the line while Klitschko defends the IBF and WBO versions of the world crown.
The 30-year-old Haye will be two pounds heavier than for his last fight against fellow Briton Audley Harrison, while Klitschko is five pounds lighter than for his previous bout against Samuel Peter.
Haye was supported by a large British contingent who have gathered in the Geman port city for the fight in the Imtech Arena used by Bundesliga side SV Hamburg.
Despite a 25-1 record, Haye is rated an underdog against the giant Klitschko, whose brother Vitali holds the WBC version of the title.
But he was in typically bullish mood as he addressed reporters after the weigh-in.
"I'm so proud to be involved in it and  for the guy that knocks the other unconscious it is going to be a great feeling, to be the main man, at the pinnacle of the heavyweight division.
"I believe being the unified heavyweight champion is the pinnacle of the sport and I'm looking forward to going in there and claiming my rightly-deserved titles," he said.
Klitschko, who has a record of 55 wins, 49 knockouts and three knockout defeats, said it was "time for the talking to end."
He will take height, reach and weight advantage into the eagerly-awaited fight which will be watched by over 50,000 in the football stadium with big television audiences in Britain and Germany, where both the Klitschko brothers have a devoted following.
