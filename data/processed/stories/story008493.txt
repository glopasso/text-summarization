The recent incident involving Chelsea and England captain John Terry and Queens Park Rangers' Anton Ferdinand has seen the issue of racism in football dominate the headlines.
The decision by London's Metropolitan Police to launch an investigation into what occurred during the October 23 match follows allegations made by Manchester United's Patrice Evra of racial abuse from Liverpool striker Luis Suarez during an English Premier League clash.
These two incidents are just the latest in a year which has seen the issue of race and football at the forefront of coverage of both club and international soccer.
