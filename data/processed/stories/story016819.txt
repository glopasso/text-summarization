(PEOPLE.com) -- Ali Landry and her husband, director Alejandro Monteverde, welcomed their second child Saturday in Los Angeles -- a boy named Marcelo Alejandro -- the actress's rep tells PEOPLE exclusively.
Shortly after announcing her pregnancy, the former Doritos spokeswoman, 38, told PEOPLE in June that she was using grilled cheese sandwiches to battle morning sickness.
At the time, Landry also said she would be "really nervous" if she had a boy. Turns out, she had a big boy: Marcelo was 8 lbs and 21 inches long at birth.
Landry and Monteverde, 34, also have a daughter, 4-year-old Estela.
