You can calm down now, Internet. Ben Affleck has gotten the original TV Batman's stamp of approval.
Adam West told People magazine at San Diego Comic-Con on Thursday that he has faith in Affleck's ability to carry the role of the Caped Crusader in the highly anticipated movie "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."
"My feeling is that Ben Affleck will be really good simply because he's a great talent," West said. "And I'd be very interested in seeing him in the role."
The release of a close-up shot of Affleck at Batman had Comic-Con has once again stirred debate about whether the role was miscast with the Academy Award winner.
One Twitter user posted a picture of an iceberg with the caption, "An Iceberg that looks like an old depressed Batman.....or Ben Affleck as it's now commonly known #BatmanvSuperman."
West, who played Batman in the TV series from 1966 to 1968, was on hand as Warner Home Video announced the coming release of the complete TV series on DVD and Blu-ray. The 85-year-old actor had some words of wisdom for Affleck.
"Just make the costume work for you, Ben," West said.
