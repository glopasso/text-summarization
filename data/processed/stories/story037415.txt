(CNN)  -- Francesca Schiavone returned "home" to the scene of her French Open triumph last year with an emphatic victory in her opener against 19-year-old American Melanie Oudin Monday.
Schiavone, who beat Samantha Stosur in last year's women's singles final, showed her liking for the red clay of Roland Garros with a 6-2 6-0 rout of the unfortunate Oudin.
The fifth-seeded Italian will meet Russian Vesna Dolonts in round two and on the evidence of her victory on the Philippe Chatrier will take some stopping.
"I'm still shaking a little bit," Schiavone told gathered reporters after her swift win.
"That court is fantastic because it's compact and the court is perfect. It goes all around you.
"It's like when you go home and your mum does everything for you and you feel comfortable. I felt like this, but with a lot of adrenaline."
Top seed Caroline Wozniacki later made light work of Japanese veteran Kimiko Date-Krumm in their first round match, winning for the loss of just two games.
The Dane is bidding for her first grand slam title.
Another pre-tournament favorite, Russian third seed Vera Zvonareva, also reached the second round by beating Spanish veteran Lourdes Dominguez Lino 6-3 6-3 on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
Zvonareva was a losing finalist at both Wimbledon and the U.S Open last year.
Her fellow Russian and 26th seed Nadia Petrova was a first day casualty, going down 6-7 6-3 6-4 to Australia's Anastasia Rodionova.
