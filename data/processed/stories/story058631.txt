For a minute, Courtney Love believed she'd found a clue in the case of the disappearance of Malaysian flight 370.
The saga of the missing airplane has captured the public's attention, and Hollywood is clearly not exempt from the intrigue. Love, best known as a musician, actress and wife of the late Nirvana front man Kurt Cobain, tweeted a picture of a body of water with the caption "really? look closer? check it out @DR24 #MH370 and its like a mile away Pulau Perak, where they 'last' tracked it."
The "it" would be the Boeing 777-200 that has been missing, along with all aboard, for more than a week. The picture Love tweeted features drawn lines meant to point to what appears to be discolorations in the water and possible debris.
Another tweet from Love says "I'm no expert but up close this does look like a plane and an oil slick. ... prayers go out to the families #MH370" with a link to Tomnod.com, a crowdsourcing site that has enlisted participants to scour satellite imagery for clues.
Love told New York Magazine's Daily Intelligencer that "Yeah I went to the satellite site and just uploaded tons and tons of pictures. I really doubt aliens took it. It's got to be somewhere. I'm a little obsessive."
The Daily Intelligencer, however, pointed out that Tomnod ruled out the theory before Love even offered it.
"Although it is still an interesting clue, it is looking much more like the other boats operating in the region," they reported Tomnod as saying. "Keep up the good work."
