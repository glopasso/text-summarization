Sure, you could get lucky like Decatur, Georgia, resident Gregory Jarrett, and find a winning Powerball lottery ticket from the January 15 drawing on the floor of your dirty room and pocket a cool $1 million.
And you've probably daydreamed about winning the Powerball lottery and retiring to someplace where they've never even heard the words Polar Vortex.
After all, with an estimated $60 million on the line and no winner after Wednesday's drawing, those who hope to strike it rich are still lining up at convenience stores in the hopes of scoring the lucky ticket.
But let's get real: Your chances of actually playing the right combination of numbers and striking it rich through the lottery are slim.
How slim? Try one in 1 in 175,223,510.
That means you have a greater chance of being killed by a shark, according to National Geographic. Those odds are 1 in 3,700,000.
And, as long as we're being morbid, you also have a 1 in 134,906 chance of being struck by lightning, say the folks over at the National Safety Council.
On the up side, you also have a 1 in 88,000 shot of dating a supermodel.
Go ahead and hedge your bets, but you have a greater chance of winning your office's Oscar pool. Of course, those odds depend on whether your office couch potato co-worker enters this year.
And the United States has much greater odds of winning Olympic gold medals. Go Team USA!
But who knows? You could get lucky like last week's winner.
The ticket, purchased at Dixon Landing Chevron in Milpitas, California, netted some undisclosed winner the $425 million jackpot.
So play away. The next drawing is Saturday.
