A Wisconsin man was recovering Friday after being bit by a 7-year-old Siberian tiger, the local sheriff's office said.
The tiger, "Khan," grabbed the arm of 38-year-old volunteer John Meeker and pulled the arm into his cage at the Wisconsin Big Cat Rescue and Educational Center in Rock Springs, said Chief Deputy Chip Meister with the Sauk County Sheriff's Office.
Meeker had been watering the tiger when he was attacked, Meister said. He added that other volunteers were able to get him away from the animal and began first aid.
The man was flown from the scene by an air ambulance service based at the University of Wisconsin Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin. The south-central Wisconsin incident is under investigation, said Meister.
