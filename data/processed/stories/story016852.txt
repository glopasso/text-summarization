Fifteen people, including a baby, were killed and 18 others were injured Sunday when a truck on its way to Lagos, Nigeria, crashed into several vehicles and caught fire, police said Monday.
Lagos police spokesman Frank Mba said the truck's brakes failed outside Lagos, and the driver lost control.
The 18 people injured were being treated in a hospital, Mba said.
