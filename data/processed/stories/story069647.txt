President Obama will deliver the eulogy Thursday at the funeral of civil rights leader Dorothy Height, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday.
Height's funeral is set for 10 a.m. ET Thursday at Washington National Cathedral.
Height died last week at the age of 98.
The lasting impact of her life was reflected Tuesday evening by the hundreds of people who came out to pay their respects at her viewing at the National Council of Negro Women, an organization that she served as national president for 41 years. People lined three city blocks in Washington to attend the viewing and praised Height as a leader.
"To me she's a part of history for women's rights and the civil rights movement," Delores Levalle said while waiting to enter the building.
Many of the people attending the viewing emphasized how inspirational she was as a woman and as a leader of the civil rights movement, a woman who stood beside Martin Luther King Jr. during his famous "I Have a Dream" speech.
Patricia Green, who worked with Height in the 1970s, said she believes "this outpouring of affection for her is an understanding of the unique contribution she has made not just to African-American history, but to American history in general."
