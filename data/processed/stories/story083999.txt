Starting this week, United's much-anticipated new 787 Dreamliner will be taking to the skies between Los Angeles and Tokyo, marking the carrier's first regular international route using the new aircraft.
Flight 32 is set to leave Los Angeles at 11:15 a.m. Thursday, arriving in Tokyo at 4:10 p.m. the next day.
United made its domestic debut of the plane in November, carrying more than 200 passengers from Texas to Chicago. United says the Dreamliner "will revolutionize the flying experience for United customers and crews while delivering unprecedented operating efficiency, comfort and lower emissions."
The Boeing aircraft was plagued by cost overruns and manufacturing delays for years before the first Dreamliner was delivered to Japan's All Nippon Airways in 2011. United was the first U.S. carrier to fly paying customers on the 787.
