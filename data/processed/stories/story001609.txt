A man police believe is a member of the ''Pink Panther'' ring of thieves was transported from Spain to Japan on Saturday to face charges in a major heist at a jewelry shop, a Japanese state news agency reported.
Rifat Hadziahmetovic, 42, of Montenegro, is suspected of stealing a diamond tiara worth 200 million yen ($2.3 million USD) and other jewelry from a Tokyo shop in 2007, according to the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo.
Spain agreed to hand Hadziahmetovic, who was in custody for a separate robbery, over to Japan, Kyodo news agency said.
The "Pink Panther" ring, which is believed to have about 200 members, is linked to more than 90 robberies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia since 1999, Kyodo said.
Hadziahmetovic is suspected of participating in other armed robberies in Bahrain, Japan and the United Arab Emirates, according to the Associated Press.
The ring is named after the 1963 movie starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. Members are believed to be mainly from countries in the Balkans, the AP said.
