Today's program takes you to Vanuatu to show you why recovery efforts are so difficult in the hurricane-stricken nation. We're also visiting a U.S. city that just officially logged its snowiest winter since it started keeping records, and we're exploring a U.S. Army facility charged with the task of safely eliminating U.S. chemical weapons. Plus, see how two American rivers are "going green" as part of St. Patrick's Day celebrations.
