Tina Fey and Amy Poehler must be in the business of making dreams come true.
According to Showbiz411, the friends and former "Saturday Night Live" co-stars may reunite on the big screen in an upcoming comedy called "The Nest."
Written by Paula Pell, the movie tells the story of two 30-something sisters who decide to throw one last raging party at their parents' home before it's sold, and through the process of bonding and fighting grow up along the way.
Fey's involvement in the project was announced in February when it was reported that she's also going to be a producer. "Pitch Perfect's" Jason Moore will direct.
At this point, Poehler is said to be in final negotiations for the project, but should she make it official she would also be an executive producer, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
It goes without saying that the combination of Fey and Poehler generally leads to success. They played a mismatched would-be mother and surrogate in 2008's "Baby Mama" and were so popular after hosting the 2013 Golden Globes that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association signed them up for two more years.
Fey and Poehler's return the next year set a record as the most-watched Globes ceremony in 10 years.
