Already boasting a treasure trove of trophies and mementos, the latest addition to Cristiano Ronaldo's own personal museum is a 10-foot bronze statue of the man himself.
The "CR7 Museum" -- opened in December 2013 in the Real Madrid attacker's hometown of Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira -- houses more than 125 awards, including the two Ballon d'Or titles he won in 2008 and 2013 after being voted the world's best player.
And now standing outside to greet those fans who make the pilgrimage to pay homage to one of football's greats is a mammoth sculpture of the Portugal captain in all his glory.
Ronaldo, fresh from helping Madrid lift FIFA's Club World Cup in Morocco on Saturday, was in Funchal just 24 hours later to unite with his family for the statue's official unveiling.
"I feel so proud to be honored with a statue in Madeira," Ronaldo wrote on his official Twitter account.
"It's a huge joy to share this moment with my family and the people from Madeira. Thank you all for the warm reception."
While in Funchal, Ronaldo also found time to receive the "Cordão Autonómico de Distinção" -- the highest distinction of Madeira.
The 29-year-old has enjoyed a 2014 to remember, having helped Madrid lift the European Champions League, European Super Cup and Spanish Copa del Rey, as well as the Club World Cup.
Ronaldo, who has scored 34 goals in 27 games for club and country this season, is favorite to land the 2014 Ballon d'Or ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer, with the result being announced on January 12, 2015.
