Pakistani authorities have arrested four men in connection with the suicide truck bombing of a Marriott Hotel last month in Islamabad that killed more than 50 people, officials said Friday.
More than 50 people died in last month's attack on the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.
The men appeared Friday before a magistrate in an anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi, police and Pakistan Federal Investigation Agency investigators said.
Although they have not been charged, the magistrate is allowing police to hold them for a week while the investigation continues.
The magistrate ordered them back to court on October 31.
Authorities have not said how they believe these men are connected to the September 20 bombing.
The men -- one of whom is a doctor -- were arrested at different times in different places, authorities said, but gave no additional details.
They identified them as: Dr. Muhammad Usman and Tehseen Ulla Jaan, both from Peshawar; Ilyas Rana Muhammad, from a village near Faiselabad in Pakistan's Punjab province; and Hameed Afzal Muhammad, from Toba Taik Singh district, also in Punjab province.
In addition to the dozens killed, some 250 people were wounded in the suicide truck attack, which sparked a fire that left the hotel in ruins.
The hotel, located near the diplomatic section of Islamabad, had been popular among tourists visiting Pakistan. It was crowded the night of the bombing.
