(CNN)Presumed dead by some, the actual fate of the aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un remains unconfirmed because of the secretive nature of that country.
Last year, a North Korean defector said that Kim Kyung Hee had died from a stroke while arguing on the phone with the North Korean leader about her husband's execution.
The defector's claims were widely reported, but doubts have persisted.
Lawmakers in neighboring South Korea told the news agency Yonhap Tuesday that the country's National Intelligence Service reported there is no evidence that Kim Kyung Hee died.
It is believed that she is still alive, a South Korean government source told CNN.
CNN could not verify claims of Kim Kyung Hee's fate.
Kim Kyung Hee is the sister of Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader who died a little more than three years ago and left his son in power.
Her husband, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in December 2013, shocking many observers around the world.
Before his execution, he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea.
But the young leader turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion, having him executed on charges that he tried to overthrow the government.
