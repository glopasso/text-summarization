Six people have died in Cyclone Hudhud on Sunday, Indian authorities said. The storm, which made landfall on India's eastern coast, has also uprooted trees and utility poles.
When the storm blew ashore, the coast was nearly emptied out. More than 200,000 people were evacuated a day before, officials said.
India's science and technology minister, Jitendra Singh, described the cyclone as "very severe."
Hudhud's sustained winds of 205 kilometers per hour (127 miles per hour) made it a category 3 storm at landfall, CNN meteorologist Derrick Van Dam. Gusts rose to 250 kmh (155 mph).
The storm rode in at high tide, which could result in surge as high as 2 meters (7 feet).
At least 100,000 residents from four districts of the state of Andhra Pradesh were moved to safer locations, such as schools and other structurally strong buildings, authorities said.
In neighboring Odisha state, another 100,000 people have also been evacuated, according to a senior emergency official.
The Indian military has mobilized its resources to areas vulnerable to Hudhud, defense officials said.
In New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about the government's plans to prepare for and recover from the surging storm.
