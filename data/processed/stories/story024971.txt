A car bomb attack in Algeria has killed three people and wounded 23, the Algerian Press Service reported.

The attack occurred Tuesday near an office housing judicial police in the city of Thenia, about 50 km (31 miles) east of the capital of Algiers, the agency said.
The blast destroyed about 20 houses, and a commission has been appointed to look after the victims, the press agency said.
Islamic extremists in Algeria and other North African countries have struck several times in recent years.
An al Qaeda affiliate claimed responsibility last year for the deadliest attack in Algiers in 10 years, a bombing that destroyed the prime minister's headquarters and a police base, killing at least 24 people and wounding more than 220.
Al Qaeda also took responsibility for a January 2 bombing that killed four and wounded 20 at a building housing security forces in Naciria, a city about 50 km (31 miles) east of Algiers. E-mail to a friend
