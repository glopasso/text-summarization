Police have identified two bodies found in the waters off Coney Island on Friday, believed to be the two people who went missing while riding on a personal watercraft on the Fourth of July, according to the U.S. Coast Guard.
The bodies of Willie Tom, 44, and Celine Fu, 29, were discovered Friday afternoon by SCUBA divers of the NYPD Harbor Patrol.
Tom's body was recovered just after noon on Friday. Fu's body was found less than one hour later. Both were found under about 14 to 15 feet of water in Gravesend Bay, located approximately one mile northwest of Coney Island, according to police.
The pair went missing in Coney Island Creek around 8:15 p.m. Thursday, according to New York Police Department spokesman Sgt. Tom Antonetti.
Several onlookers saw the pair riding together on a personal watercraft.
Fu apparently fell off and Tom circled back and dived in after her.
"They weren't wearing life vests," U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Erik Swanson said.
Coney Island Creek is adjacent to the Kaiser Park area of Brooklyn.
