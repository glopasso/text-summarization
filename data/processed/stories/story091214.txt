New Jersey towns could soon get help paying the extra costs of having drunken reality show stars wandering their streets.
The proposed "Snookiville Law" would let townships license reality show productions and levy fees on them to pay for additional police to control the cast members and the crowds drawn by the shows' cameras, New Jersey Assemblyman Ronald Dancer said.
The legislation is named for Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi, star of MTV's "Jersey Shore," who was arrested for disorderly conduct in Seaside, New Jersey, two years ago, Dancer said.
While "Jersey Shore" is in its last season of taping, Snooki and co-star JWoww (Jennifer Farley) have been producing a spinoff show in Manchester, which is near Dancer's central New Jersey district.
"This bill will permit local officials to make sure taxpayers don't get 'Snook'-ered or public safety is compromised when reality stars such as Snooki or JWoww come to town," Dancer said.
The law would not prevent drunken reality stars from stumbling down the streets, Dancer said. "I can't go as far as to say that would not happen."
Dancer, a Republican, said he is not trying to discourage reality TV shows from taping in New Jersey, because production can bring money to a community. But it also "may cost taxpayers money by requiring additional services when cameras are rolling in town," he said.
