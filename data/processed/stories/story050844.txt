Campbell Soup Co. is recalling nearly 15 million pounds of canned SpaghettiOs with meatballs because of possible under-processing, the U.S. agriculture department said.
The recall includes 14.75-ounce cans with a use-by date between June 2010 and December 2011 of three varieties of the product: "SpaghettiOs with Meatballs," "SpaghettiOs A to Z with Meatballs" and "SpaghettiOs Fun Shapes with Meatballs (Cars)."
Consumers who have purchased those products with a plant code of "EST4K" should not eat them and should return them to the store where they were purchased for an exchange or full refund, Campbell Soup said.
The company said in a statement that it was voluntarily recalling the products "in an abundance of caution," and that there was "no information indicating that any under-processed product has reached consumers."
The agriculture department also said it had received no reports of illnesses from consumption of the products.
The cans were produced in Paris, Texas, between December 2008 and June 2010, and shipped to retail customers nationwide, according to Campbell Soup.
The company discovered the problem during a routine warehouse inspection and investigation, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service said.
