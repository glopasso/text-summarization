Ever dreamed of renting out an entire island for your family and friends? Sir Richard Branson's private home in the British Virgin Islands is on the rental market again.
The price tag? A mere $60,000 per night for 30 adults and up to six children.
Branson's Great House on Necker Island was struck by lightning during a storm in August 2011 and destroyed in the resulting fire. Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet made headlines by rescuing Branson's elderly mother from the flames. The island has been accessible to renters since the fire, but with more limited capacity.

"Necker Island has been my home for more than 30 years, and for me it is the most beautiful place in the world," Branson said in a statement. "The brand new Great House is the heart of the island and I'm thrilled with the results."
The two-year reconstruction was modeled after the original design. The Great House, where guests gather for meals and socializing, has a master suite, eight additional bedrooms and a bunk room that sleeps up to six children. There are also six individual one-bedroom Bali Houses across the island.

Included in the price tag are your accommodations, all meals and drinks (both non-alcoholic and alcoholic), boat transfers from Virgin Gorda or Beef Island (Tortola) airports, water sports, tennis and a freshwater pool and large Jacuzzi.
If you don't want to hire the entire island, designated "Celebration Weeks" allow guests to book individual rooms hotel-style for seven nights (and sometimes fewer, depending on availability).
