Pakistan's new president called GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin "gorgeous" when the two met in New York on Wednesday.
Vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin meets Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in New York on Wednesday.
Palin has been in New York meeting international leaders in town this week for United Nations meetings.
On entering a room filled with several Pakistani officials Wednesday, Palin was immediately greeted by Sherry Rehman, the country's information minister.
"And how does one keep looking that good when one is that busy?" Rehman asked Palin, drawing friendly laughter from the room.
"Oh, thank you," Palin said.
Pakistan's new president, Asif Ali Zardari, entered the room seconds later. Palin rose to shake his hand, saying she was "honored" to meet him.
Zardari then called her "gorgeous" and said: "Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you."
"You are so nice," Palin said, smiling. "Thank you."
A handler from Zardari's entourage then told the two politicians to keep shaking hands for the cameras.
"If he's insisting, I might hug," Zardari said. Palin smiled politely in response.
The Alaska governor did not answer questions from reporters at her first two appearances on Wednesday, when she joined running mate Sen. John McCain in meetings with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko and then traveled downtown to meet with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani.
But she did offer brief remarks to a reporter at the Zardari meeting who asked about her day.
"It's going great," Palin said. "These meetings are very informative and helpful, and a lot of good people sharing appreciation for America."
