(EW.com) -- Neil Patrick Harris and the rest of the killer gang of presidential assassins will reunite for one night only to reprise their roles from the 2004 Tony Award-winning production of "Assassins."
The December 3 performance will benefit Roundabout Theatre Company's musical program.
Stephen Sondheim's characteristically dark, witty musical -- which first played Broadway from 1990-91 -- explores the personal lives and motivations of the people who have attempted (both successfully and unsuccessfully) to kill American presidents.
Harris plays Lee Harvey Oswald in the play, while Michael Cerveris will revive his role as John Wilkes Booth (for which he won a Tony for best featured actor in a musical), and Denis O'Hare will reprise his Tony-nominated role as Charles Guiteau, who murdered POTUS 20 James A. Garfield.

In addition to "How I Met Your Mother" star Harris, several more cast members have made waves on TV since they starred in Roundabout's Assassins revival, including "True Blood's" Denis O'Hare (a 2012 Emmy nominee for "American Horror Story"), "Girls' " Becky Ann Baker, and "Sex and the City"â€Ž favorite Mario Cantone.
The benefit will take place at Studio 54 -- where the revival opened on Broadway in April 22, 2004. Tony winner Joe Mantello will return to direct.
