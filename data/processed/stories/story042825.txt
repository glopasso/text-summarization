(CNN)Another winter storm is heading toward the Northeast, expected to add to already record snowfalls in the region.
Winter storm warnings have been issued across upstate New York, northern Connecticut, northern Rhode Island and the greater Boston area.
The National Weather Service predicts between 1 to 2 feet of  snow to fall in northeastern Massachusetts through Monday night.
Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh is once again asking people to stay inside and off the roads.
"We need residents to take extra precautions as we prepare for another storm and extremely low temperatures," he said in a statement.
Flurries and light snow are expected to fall in Boston on Saturday evening, turning into heavy snow Sunday night through Monday.
Two brutal storms hit the Northeast just last week, closing airports, canceling classes and creating piles of snow along cleared roadways.
"I'm tired of it," said Boston University freshman Cameron Barkan, who's already missed three days of class because of the storms. "I usually like snow, but this is just a little much," he said.
Boston set a record for the snowiest seven-day period in history with over 40 inches, according to the NWS.
The city is way past its average annual snowfall of 47 inches.
