The countdown to the 22nd Winter Olympic Games is well and truly underway, with just a few days to go until Sochi 2014.
Athletes will be going for gold in 98 events, ranging from skeleton bob to biathlon, across 15 sports at 10 different competitive venues.
The opening ceremony at the purpose-built Fisht Olympic Stadium will take place on February 7, fittingly scheduled for 20:14 local time (1614 GMT).
Sixteen days of competition will ensue culminating in the closing ceremony, which will bring the curtain down on proceedings before attention turns to the Winter Games of 2018 in PyeongChang, South Korea.
With time running out to acquaint yourself with the arenas that will stage the Games, make sure you are adequately prepared for the oncoming action by studying CNN's map of the multiple Sochi 2014 venues.
