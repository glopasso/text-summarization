Eliot Spitzer, who resigned as governor of New York in the wake of a prostitution scandal, is looking at a return -- this time as comptroller of New York City.
He said he hoped that voters would be able to see beyond his past.
"I accepted responsibly for what I did," Spitzer told CNN late Sunday night. "I spent five years of working, doing useful things, and I hope the public will offer me an opportunity."
Spitzer, a Democrat, resigned in 2008 after revelations about his relationship with a prostitute. Since stepping down, he has worked as a commentator for various news outlets, including CNN.
In running for comptroller, Spitzer said he's looking for forgiveness and a second chance.
"The metaphor is what I did with the attorney general's office," he said. "It is ripe for greater and more exciting use of the office's jurisdiction."
Besides serving as governor, Spitzer was New York's attorney general.
Spitzer said he has his wife's support as he jumps back into political life, but doesn't know if she'll be joining him on the campaign trail.
