The International Olympic Committee chose Pyeongchang, South Korea, Wednesday to host the 2018 Olympic Winter Games.
The other two bid cities were Munich, Germany, and Annecy, France.
Pyeongchang narrowly failed in its bids for 2010 and 2014, losing by three votes to Vancouver, Canada, for last year's event and by four votes to Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 event.
South Korea has never hosted the Winter Games, though the capital city of Seoul hosted the 1988 Summer Games.
France has hosted three editions of the Winter Olympics, most recently in 1992 in Albertville.
Munich would have been the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The city attracted the Summer Games in 1972.
Representatives from the three cities made their cases to committee members in Durban, South Africa Wednesday.
The proposed date for the festival of sport to begin is February 9, 2018.
The Games will take place across 13 venues, with six of those to be constructed of the next seven years.
Pyeongchang will become the first Asian city outside of Japan to play host to the Winter Games and hopes to become a center for Winter sports once the event is over.
The delegation representing Pyeongchang included Lee Myung-Bak, president of South Korea, 2010 figure skating gold medalist Kim Yu-Na and the former governor of Gangwon province -- where the city is located -- Kim Jin-Seun.
