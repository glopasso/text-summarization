The Elephant Family, a conservation group based in England, mourned the loss of its chairman and the "head of our family."

CNN profiled the charity, which was working to improve conditions for Asian elephants, in 2007.
Shand said he was trying to show owners and riders more humane ways to treat the animals.
"You can't stop a tradition that's been going on for years, you can only help it," he said. His group also fought against poachers and the destruction of the elephants' habitats.
Shand also was the author of several books about elephants and his travels in Asia. One of those books, "Queen of Elephants," was the source for a BBC documentary.
