Zsa Zsa Gabor, who asked for a priest "to read her the last rites" Sunday, left the hospital Monday afternoon because she "wants to spend her final days at her home," her publicist said.
Gabor, 93, is suffering complications from last month's hip-replacement surgery, but she and her husband decided against additional surgery, publicist John Blanchette said.
Doctors told her the chances of success from the procedure was 50-50, so she chose to go home instead, Blanchette said.
An ambulance carried the actress from Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles to her Bel Air, California, home Monday afternoon, he said.
"The doctors did everything they could do," her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, said. "The rest is up to her to whether she recovers or not."
Gabor has been hospitalized for most of the past month since breaking her hip in a fall from bed on July 17. Saturday marked Gabor's 24th wedding anniversary with Von Anhalt, her eighth husband.
She was rushed to the hospital from her Bel Air, California, home Friday night, Blanchette said.
She underwent surgery for the removal of a blood clot that night, a complication relating to her recent hip replacement surgery, he said.
Gabor had just returned home from the hospital on Wednesday, three weeks after undergoing surgery to replace the broken hip.
She has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her other husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.
Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge," "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953, "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957 and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
