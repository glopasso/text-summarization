Ford helped modernize the modeling, leading to the evolution of supermodels in the fashion industry.
Ford Model grew into "one of the world's most prestigious agencies" because of her "her unwavering passion, curiosity and drive," the company said.
A quote from Ford accompanied the death announcement: "You never know when or where you will find the next new model, but you can bet someone from Ford Models will be looking."
