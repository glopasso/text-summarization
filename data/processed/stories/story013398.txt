The winner of last week's $338 million Powerball jackpot is expected to appear in a New Jersey court Monday on a warrant for unpaid child support.
Pedro Quezada, 44, the father of five children ages 5 to 23, owes back child support totaling $29,000, according to William Maer of the Passaic County Sheriff's Office. It is not clear which children would be covered by the payments.
A warrant for the unpaid sum was issued in 2009 and was stayed by a judge pending Quezada's expected court appearance.
On Thursday, Quezada's son, Casiano, said his father has hired an attorney and is "working through it."
Attempts to reach the attorney representing Quezada were unsuccessful.
Maer said that a child support warrant usually leads to payment, a scheduled payment plan or arrest. Maer could not comment further on the Quezada case because the investigation is ongoing.
Every person who wins more than $600 in the lottery is checked for outstanding taxes, liens, child support payments and the like, according to Judith Drucker, public relations manager for the New Jersey Lottery. The funds owed are taken out of the final payment from the lottery winner, she added.
Quezada has chosen a cash payment of his lottery prize that will amount to approximately $152 million after taxes.
