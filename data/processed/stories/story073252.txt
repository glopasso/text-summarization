A 22-year-old Sudanese model who had been missing for nearly two weeks was found in an area hospital, a New York Police detective told CNN on Monday night.
Detective Kelly Ort had no details about the condition of Ataui-Deng Hopkins, known in the fashion world as Ataui Deng.
She was last seen August 6 about 11 p.m. on West 48th Street in Midtown Manhattan, according to a New York City Police Department statement released earlier Monday.
Hopkins has worked with designers from Oscar de la Renta to Diane von Furstenberg, according to Corinne Nicolas, president of Trump Model Management. She has been featured in Vogue and worked for names such as Hermes and Kenzo.
She was born in Sudan and immigrated to San Antonio, Texas, before signing with Trump Models in 2008, Nicolas told CNN.
"She's a much-loved model," Nicolas said. "She's got a great personality, a great heart. She's someone that people enjoy working with."
Hopkins is 6-feet-1 and weighs 110 pounds. She lives in Manhattan's East Village, according to police.
"We are very worried," said Nicolas, who said she learned of Hopkins' disappearance last week.
