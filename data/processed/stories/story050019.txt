While digging through a box that belonged to his father, Robert Ondrovic uncovered a collection of vintage photos that brought him back to the 1964 World's Fair.
Armed with a Yashica camera, Ondrovic's father captured everything from family portraits to the modern architecture, which was considered futuristic at the time, said the New York resident. Ondrovic was just 4 years old when his family visited the fair at Flushing Meadows Corona Park in Queens.
Today, the photos are a throwback to a different era: Many of the women are decked out in dresses (though Ondrovic's mother is sporting mint green capris), a man smokes a cigarette as he strolls through the park, and the Zeppelin-like IBM Pavilion heralds the future of technology.
"It's nice to look back at these and remember all these memories," said Ondrovic, who originally posted the photos to CNN iReport. "Then photography was a luxury because film was expensive. My dad took everything and put it on slides."
Ondrovic's father introduced both his sons to photography when he bought them Brownie cameras. (Ondrovic's brother, Richard, was allowed to bring his camera to the fair. He's six years older.)
This week marked the 50th anniversary of the grand opening of the fair, which ran April 22 through October 18, 1964, and April through October 1965. The fair's theme of "peace through understanding in a shrinking globe and in an expanding universe," is most easily seen through the 12-story steel globe dubbed the Unisphere. It's one of two structures still standing.

A group of local volunteers has vowed to preserve the other structure, the New York State Pavilion. So far, the New York State Pavilion Paint Project has managed to clean and repaint the iconic building.
