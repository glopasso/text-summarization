(EW.com) -- While broadcast shows at 10 p.m. on Tuesday are struggling to stay above a 2.0 in the adults 18-49 demo this fall, the biker drama "Sons of Anarchy" cleared that hurdle with ease once again.
All told, 4.6 million viewers tuned in and the show pulled a 2.4 in the demo, up 14 percent from last week and ranking as the fifth season's best rating since last month's premiere.

By comparison, the broadcast networks aired CBS' "Vegas" (12.1 million viewers, 2.0 in the demo), ABC's "Private Practice" (6 million, 1.6) and NBC's "Parenthood" (4.5 million, 1.6). This is tracking to be the highest-rated season for "Sons" yet.
What's impressive is how ratings for heavily serialized cable shows like "Dexter" and "SOA" can continually grow. It's easy to say, "NBC should have a show like 'Sons,'" but season one ratings for "Sons" wouldn't have been high enough to survive on broadcast.
It's only after being nurtured for years on FX that the series is now big enough to pose a threat.
