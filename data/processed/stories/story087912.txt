Hundreds filed by a casket on Sunday to say goodbye to a small-town hero who died shortly after scoring the winning shot to clinch an undefeated season for his Michigan high school basketball team.
Friends, family and even competitors braved a cold Michigan day for a pair of afternoon visitations for 16-year-old Wes Leonard of Fennville. Some piled off of school buses and hugged each other in the crisp winter air.
"He was just an all around great guy to play against," Craig Peterson, a player on the Bangor high school basketball team, told CNN affiliate WZZM. "He was always respectful, he didn't run his mouth like most of the people would. He just liked to have fun, and was a great athlete."
Leonard's funeral is set for 10:30 a.m. Tuesday at Christ Memorial Church in nearby Holland.
Leonard died moments after scoring the winning basket in overtime Thursday, securing a perfect season for the Fennville High School Blackhawks. Leonard scored his team's last four points in the 57-55 victory.
An autopsy Friday revealed Leonard died of cardiac arrest due to an enlarged heart, according to a statement from Dr. David A. Start, the Ottawa County chief medical examiner.
