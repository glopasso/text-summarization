(CNN)Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, made news this week when he told CNN's Dana Bash that he would get his health care through Obamacare. Previously, Cruz's family was covered under his wife's policy through her employer, the investment bank Goldman Sachs. But with her husband's presidential candidacy underway, Heidi Cruz has taken a leave without pay. So she has lost her Goldman Sachs health benefits.
The story went viral, in part because Cruz once engineered a partial government shutdown to try to kill Obamacare. As part of his crusade, Cruz conducted a 21-hour talkathon on the Senate floor, during which he read Dr. Seuss' classic "Green Eggs and Ham." Spoiler alert: "Green Eggs and Ham" ends with the protagonist actually trying the food he thought he hated -- and liking it. Now that Cruz is likely to try Obamacare, my guess is he will have a similar experience.
So, with apologies to Dr. Seuss -- who would no doubt have found a way to rhyme "President Bar" with "Obamacare" -- here is my updated version of "Green Eggs and Ham."
