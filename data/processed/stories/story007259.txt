At least five people have been killed in the grenade attack on a minibus in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi, the country's Interior Ministry said Saturday on its official Twitter account.
An attacker was among those killed. Other people were injured in the strike, strongly condemned by the ministry.
The blast occurred in the predominantly Somali neighborhood of Pangani.
The grenade tore through the bus, blew out windows and sent debris flying into the busy street. Security forces were sifting through the wreckage for clues on who might be responsible.
The attack is the deadliest in Nairobi since the September siege of an upscale mall by the Somali terror group Al-Shabaab, an affiliate of al Qaeda, where 67 people were killed.
