(CNN)If you haven't yet been asked by friends or co-workers to Meerkat, chances are you will soon.
The livestreaming app took Austin by storm last week, with media outlets -- including CNNMoney -- calling it "the new SXSW sweetheart," "the coolest cat" and the festival's "big star."
The San Francisco-based startup launched February 27 and has been adding users rapidly ever since. Even Jimmy Fallon is streaming his life using Meerkat.
As part of our Instant Startups series (see the videos above), CNNMoney correspondent Laurie Segall reached out to Meerkat founder Ben Rubin with some questions. And he agreed to answer them -- on Meerkat, of course.
