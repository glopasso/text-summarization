As millions of people get their hands on the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus on Friday, many will no doubt be looking for new apps that take advantage of the new phones' capabilities.
Chief among them is a bigger screen. The iPhone 6 has a 4.7-inch display, while the 6 Plus checks in at a whopping 5.5 inches.
But they'll also have better graphics and faster processors, as well as features that give app developers freedoms they've never had before.
For the first time, Apple is letting developers create widgets, mini-programs that are often designed to be quick and easy to use. They can tinker with the iPhone's keyboard for the first time as well, giving iOS users access to some apps that Android users have enjoyed for the past couple of years.
