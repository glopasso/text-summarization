It has been the official home of the British monarchy since 1837. But for two nights, Buckingham Palace is being transformed into the canvas for a world record attempt of the biggest ever collaboration of artists into a single art installation.
A majestic mosaic of Queen Elizabeth II projected on to the palace faÃ§ade is composed of over 200,000 self portraits of children from across the United Kingdom.
As well as self portraits from children, some of Britain's most well-known faces have submitted artwork for the project including award winning Grammy singer and songwriter Adele and Rolling Stones rocker Ronnie Wood.
Gallery: From royal residence to record-breaking art
The project, Face Britain comes from The Prince's Foundation for Children and the Arts.
The images will be projected on Buckingham Palace until 21 April.
It aims to provide a platform to celebrate the nation's younger generations in the lead up to this year's Diamond Jubilee and Olympic Games.
