The Queen of Talk's influence is reaching new heights with the unveiling of a plane marking the 25th and final season of the "Oprah Winfrey Show."
United Airlines debuted a 757 Thursday newly painted from nose to tail with the logo for the show's farewell season. During its inaugural flight from Chicago, Illinois, one ticketed passenger will receive enough United miles for a trip around the world.
"As Chicago's hometown airline, United is proud to celebrate The Oprah Winfrey Show's Farewell Season with our customers, employees and 'Oprah' show fans," said Mark Bergsrud, senior vice president of marketing for United, in a statement.
"This unique plane represents the global reach of two great Chicago icons."
The Oprah plane will fly United customers between cities in the airline's domestic network through May 2011. An onboard video featuring Oprah Winfrey will greet customers.
United is also launching a sweepstakes that will award 1 million United Mileage Plus miles to one passenger each month through May 2011.
Passengers on the inaugural flight to Los Angeles, California, will take home "Oprah 25" fleece blankets.
