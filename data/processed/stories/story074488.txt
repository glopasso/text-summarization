Meanwhile in Italy, Juventus coach Antonio Conte's 10-month ban for corruption has been extended by football's world governing body, FIFA to include all matches worldwide.
"This suspension covers all types of matches, including domestic, international, friendly and official fixtures," a statement on the FIFA website said.
Conte, who led Juventus to the Serie A title last season, was suspended by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) on August 10 for failing to report alleged corruption in two Serie B matches when he was previously in charge of then second flight Siena in 2010-11.
The 43-year-old, who appealed, but failed to overturn the FIGC ban, will now not take charge of the Turin club's upcoming Champions League campaign which kicks off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on September 19.
