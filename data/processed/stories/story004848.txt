Michelle Wie clung on to a share of the lead at the U.S. Women's Open Saturday as the former teenage prodigy bids for her first major title after a series of near misses.
Wie shot a two-over 72 on the testing Pinehurst No.2 course, which was used for the men's U.S. Open won by Martin Kaymer last week.
It left her on two-under 208 to be joined by South Korea's Amy Yang, who posted a third round two-under 68 with six birdies.
"I was hitting the ball really solid today, and I had good speed on the greens," Yang said. "I had a great round today."
Wie, now 24, has twice led her national open going into the final round, in 2005 and 2006, but finished tied for 23rd and tied third respectively.
In fine form in 2014, Wie finished second in the opening major of the season, the Kraft Nabisco Championship, and won the LPGA Lotte Championship in April.
She led after two opening rounds of 68, but admitted she had to "grind it out" during her third round.
Asked about her prospects of victory Sunday, Wie remained non-committal.
"I'm just grateful to have another opportunity," she told Sky Sports. "I'm going to play as well as I can and hope for the best."
Wie might have held a one-shot lead but missed a 10-foot birdie putt on the final green, the sort of chances which were being holed on the first two days.
In a tournament which was dominated at the start by the astonishing feat of 11-year-old Lucy Li in qualifying for the championship, 53-year-old Juli Inkster struck a blow for the diminishing band of veteran players on the LPGA Tour.
American Inkster carded a best of the day 66 to join the group tied for third on two-over, which also included Australian amateur Minjee Lee, South Korean Choi Na-Yeon and Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow.
Inkster, playing her 35th U.S. Open, has won seven majors and is set to retire at the end of the season.
