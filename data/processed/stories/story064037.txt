Miley Cyrus may be well-known for some wild antics, but she insists taking drugs is not one of them.
According to People, the singer refuted rumors that her recent illness was anything other than the reported bad reaction to medicine. It led to the rescheduling of some dates for her "Bangerz" tour.
Cyrus insisted she is "the poster child for good health" while speaking Tuesday during a press conference at London's O2 Arena in anticipation of her rebooted European tour.
"I didn't have a drug overdose," she said. "I took some s****y antibiotics that a doctor gave me for a sinus infection and I had a reaction."
Cyrus fell ill in April while on tour and was hospitalized for an "extreme allergic reaction." The illness also caused her to delay the start of her European tour.
The former "Hannah Montana" star now says she is on the mend, thanks in part to vitamins and honey. She said she was happy to be past "the most miserable two weeks of my life."
"I'm probably the only one on this tour who doesn't drink or smoke before a show, as I take this really seriously," Cyrus said. "It's almost like being an athlete being up here, because if someone was f***ed up, they definitely couldn't do my show."
