A 25-year-old man suffered life-threatening injuries Tuesday when a shark attacked him while he was surfing in Eureka, California, local authorities said.
Other surfers pulled the injured man from the water, loaded him into a pickup truck and rushed him to a hospital before the local beach patrol could respond, the Humboldt County Sheriff's Office said.
A deputy who spoke with the victim as he was being taken to surgery said the man suffered a 14-inch bite wound and other, smaller wounds. The deputy did not specify what parts of the body were injured.
The attack occurred shortly after noon off the North Jetty at Eureka's Bunker Surf Spot. Officials did not release the victim's name.
