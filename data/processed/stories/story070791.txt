Kate Winslet is now officially a mom of three.
The 38-year-old actress and her husband, Ned Rocknroll, welcomed their first child together in the UK on Saturday.
"Kate had 'baby boy Winslet' on Saturday, December 7, at an NHS Hospital in Sussex County, UK," the star's rep told CNN in a statement. "Mother and Baby are doing great."
The couple hasn't released a name for their baby boy, but we're hoping they're strongly considering "Long Live."
Winslet also has two children from prior relationships with Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes: daughter Mia, 13, and son Joe, 10.
Winslet and Rocknroll, who tied the knot in December 2012, announced that they were expecting a new addition in June. According to People magazine, the award-winning actress enjoyed her pregnancy.
"I feel completely great," she told the magazine in September. "Being a parent turns you inside out. It completely transforms your life and, of course, your children are your absolute everything."
