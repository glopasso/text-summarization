A sightseeing ride in the skies over New York City turned into a whole different kind of adventure on Sunday when the helicopter made an emergency landing in the Hudson River.
The pilot and the four tourists on board were rescued and are OK, according to police on the scene. The tourists included two adults and two children, all from Sweden, CNN affiliate WCBS reported.
Four people were taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries, the New York City Fire Department said. One person refused further medical attention after being checked out at the scene.
The chopper landed in the water around noon and was floating upright, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
"We lost power," said the pilot, who would not give his name or further details.
The helicopter hit the water near 79th Street, the New York Fire Department said.
The chopper was drifting south, fire officials said. A vessel picked it up to tow it back to land.
