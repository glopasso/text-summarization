Carnival Cruise Lines announced five more cancelled sailings Wednesday on the Carnival Splendor to allow more time to repair the ship damaged by fire last month.
A fire in the engine room on November 8 crippled the ship, stranding passengers off the coast of Mexico for several days without air conditioning or hot showers.
Departures on January 6, 23 and 30 and February 6 and 13 have been added to cancellations originally stretching through mid-January.
The ship is now scheduled to return to service on February 20, according to the cruise line.
"We sincerely apologize to our guests for having to cancel these additional cruises," said Gerry Cahill, Carnival's president and CEO.
"We know this is extremely disappointing for our guests and particularly disheartening for those who already had their vacations cancelled once and are now being affected again," Cahill said.
Additional issues were discovered in the process of repairing the ship and Carnival is waiting on parts being manufactured in Europe.
Refunds or future cruise credits are being provided to impacted travelers. Carnival will also reimburse passengers for air travel change fees and some customers will be eligible for a 25 percent discount and/or an onboard credit on a future cruise.
