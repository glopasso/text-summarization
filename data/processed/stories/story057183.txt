Kenya's Patrick Makau set a new world record for the marathon in Berlin Sunday as previous record holder Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia failed to finish.
Makau led home a Kenyan 1-2-3 in a time of two hours three minutes 38 seconds, shaving 21 seconds off the record set in the corresponding race in the German capital three years ago by Gebrselassie.
Stephen Kwelio Chemlany took second with Edwin Kimaiyo placing third.
Gebrselassie, 38, was prominent until the 35km mark before dropping out, just as he had done in the New York marathon last November.
He was trying to gain a qualifying time for the 2012 London Olympics and will now target the Dubai marathon early next year to achieve his aim.
Makau, 26, was successfully defending his Berlin crown, with the added bonus of taking the world record on a traditionally fast course.
Kenya's Florence Kiplagat won the women's race in two hours 19 minutes and 43 seconds with Germany's Irina Mikitenko in second place.
Britain's world record holder Paula Radcliffe finished third on her comeback to marathon after giving birth to her second child and a series of injuries.
Her time of two hours 23 minutes 46 minute was over eight minutes slower than her world's best but qualifies her for the Olympics on home soil.
