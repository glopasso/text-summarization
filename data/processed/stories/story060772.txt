Four people died when a small plane with 10 aboard crashed in southwestern Alaska on Friday evening, authorities said.
The Cessna 208 went down near St. Mary's village after it was reported missing the same day. Its wreckage was later discovered.
The relatives of the deceased have been notified, said Megan Peters, a spokeswoman for Alaska State Troopers.
The deceased are Rose Polty, Richard Polty, Wyatt Coffee and the pilot, Terry Hansen.
No more information was available on the victims.
The U.S. Coast Guard, state troopers and Life Med Alaska responded to the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, the agency said in a tweet.
