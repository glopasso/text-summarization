An Egyptian military official died Wednesday when a bomb attached to his car exploded, state-run EgyNews reported.
The homemade magnetic sticky bomb killed Brig. Gen. Ahmed Zaki in the Cairo suburb Sixth October City.
A policeman was injured in the attack, EgyNews reported.
Last week, two Egyptian police officers were injured during an attack near Cairo, when an improvised explosive device detonated at a traffic security checkpoint, according to Egynews.
Two weeks ago, authorities killed two Muslim Brotherhood members during a gunfight in the Nile Delta, north of Cairo. Police clashed in several cities with protesters supporting former President Mohamed Morsy.
The military ousted Morsy in a coup last year during massive street demonstrations against his rule. Attacks targeting police and the army have spiked since he was deposed.
