Rock singer Sammy Hagar, a little older since his Van Halen days but still featuring bountiful blond curls, touted single moms, family and sex Monday night on the premiere of HLN's "Dr. Drew."
But for Van Halen fans, Hagar's memories of the band and how he would like to regain a friendship with Eddie Van Halen may have been the biggest draw.
"The greatest part of my musical career was being in Van Halen," said Hagar, who described to Dr. Drew Pinsky the alcoholism in his father and former bandmates.
One of the band members, Hagar said, went into rehab and got clean, but "Eddie keeps falling down and would be in denial."
Hagar, 63, claims Eddie Van Halen, who he says is doing better these days, is perhaps jealous of his success since leaving the band, a power hard rock mainstay of the 1980s and 1990s.
"They threw me out of the band, and they haven't done anything since 18 years later," said Hagar, author of a bestseller "Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock."
"He's got the biggest heart in the world," Hagar said of Eddie Van Halen.
In other comments, Hagar:
-- Recalled dreaming as a young man about an alien encounter, with blue beings and beams of light. "You can call me crazy all you want. Anyone who says we are the only life in this whole vast universe, they are crazy."
-- Admitted to many sexual consorts during his days on the road and between marriages. Now, "I chase my wife around the house."
-- Talked about being raised by a single mother in an abusive marriage. "My mother made me feel love."
-- He also spoke about his father who he said died in the back of a police car."Because of my father I am very sensitive to it," Hagar said of alcoholism.
-- Touted old-fashioned hard work. "I was willing to work my butt off for anything I could achieve," Hagar said. "I came from nothing."
Pinsky, who has been a physician for 30 years, opened the show with an answer to critics who say he can't diagnose at a distance.
"I have studied thousands of cases ... It's what I do."
He said his work includes family issues, sex, addiction and other aspects of the "human experience. Why we do what we do."
