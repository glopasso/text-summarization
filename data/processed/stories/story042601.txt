A man police believe shot and killed two people at a California toll plaza during the height of evening rush hour Tuesday was taken into custody early Wednesday, authorities told CNN affiliate KTVU.
Police say Nathaniel Burris, 46, was arrested just after 3 a.m. on Interstate 80 near Baxter, California.
Nathaniel Burris, 46, was arrested just after 3 a.m. on Interstate 80 near Baxter, California, by the California Highway Patrol, Richmond, California, police Sgt. Bisa French told KTVU.
The shooting happened at 5:55 p.m. at the entrance to the 7.5-mile Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, which links Contra Costa and Marin counties, California Highway Patrol spokesman Sam Morgan told CNNRadio.
Deborah Ross, 51, was killed inside one of the toll booths, the California governor's office said. The other person killed was a man shot while sitting in his vehicle, which was parked in a lot at the toll plaza, Morgan said.
KTVU identified the man as Ersie "Chuck" Everett, 58. Both people were shot with a shotgun, authorities said.
The suspect drove off in a white 2005 Ford van with "Western Eagle Shuttle" printed on it in orange and blue letters, Morgan said.
Richmond police said the deaths appeared to stem from a domestic dispute, KTVU said. French told the station Burris was in a "dating relationship" and lived with Ross.
Aerial footage showed traffic backed up after the shooting, with cars being ushered through the far-right toll lane.
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger issued a statement expressing shock and sadness over Ross' death. The statement said Capitol flags would be flown at half-staff in her memory.
