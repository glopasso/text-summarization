Singer Al Jarreau "became weak from the altitude" in the French Alps and was hospitalized Wednesday, forcing the jazz singer to cancel several shows in France, Germany and Azerbaijan over the next week, his publicist said.
Jarreau was admitted to an intensive care unit after he arrived in the resort town of Barcelonette in the southern French Alps, the publicist said in a written statement.
"He is now awake and his first question was to enquire about his wife, Susan, and his second question was to ask about his tour dates," the statement said. "He is always thinking about other people."
His condition was stabilized, but the doctor advised Jarreau to take a few days off of his tour to recover, it said.
In addition to missing the Barcelenette show, the illness forced cancellation of shows in Osnabruck and Braunschweig, Germany and Qabala, Azerbaijan.
"Al deeply regrets having been forced to cancel these four concerts and thus disappointing his fans, but is looking forward to returning to perform in these cities some time in the future," the statement said.
Jarreau could return to the concert stage next Thursday in Nuremberg, Germany, it said.
