Gerry Goffin, a hit songwriter and former husband of Carole King, died early Thursday. He was 75.
Together with King, he wrote such classics as "The Loco-Motion," "Will You Love Me Tomorrow" and "Up on the Roof."
King described Goffin as her first love.
"He had a profound impact on my life and the rest of the world. Gerry was a good man and a dynamic force, whose words and creative influence will resonate for generations to come," she said in a statement.
"His words expressed what so many people were feeling but didn't know how to say. If you want to join his loved ones in honoring him, look at the names of the songwriters under the titles of songs," King added.
The lyricist died at home of natural causes, according to a statement from his publicity agency.
Goffin's repertoire of hits ran across decades, from the early 1960s through the late 1990s, and includes some of the most familiar songs of modern times.
Born in Brooklyn, Goffin met King when they were students at Queens College, according to a biography on the Songwriters Hall of Fame website. They married in 1959.
Their big break came soon after with "Will You Love Me Tomorrow," which was recorded by The Shirelles. Luminaries like The Beatles and Whitney Houston also performed his songs.
Among Goffin's other hits are: "Saving All My Love For You" with Michael Masser, "Who Put The Bomp" with Barry Mann and "I've Got To Use My Imagination" with Barry Goldberg.
He is survived by his wife, Michele Goffin, five children and six grandchildren.
