What a year Meryl Davis is having.
Not only did she win a gold medal with her ice-dancing partner Charlie White during the Winter Olympics in Sochi, but she also nabbed the "Dancing With the Stars" mirror ball trophy. Davis and her pro partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy were declared the champions of Season 18 on Tuesday night.
Awaiting the results, the pair appeared to have tears in their eyes as they held each other and swayed back and forth as they awaited host Tom Bergeron's announcement of who had won. The audience exploded as Davis and Chmerkovskiy's names were called.
"It's just plastic, but it means so much," Chmerkovskiy said. "And when it's lasted a decade of running after, it means that much more, and to do it with Meryl is a dream come true. There's a reason why it didn't happen before -- it's because this was meant to happen with this one."
They squared off in the finale against Paralympic snowboarder Amy Purdy and her partner Derek Hough. Former "Full House" star Candace Cameron Bure and her pro partner Mark Ballas came in third.
Davis and Chmerkovskiy were heralded throughout the season for their performances and chemistry with judge Carrie Ann Inaba telling them after their final dance that "The best part of the season was you two." Inaba also suggested that the pair should get married which further stirred buzz that the passion the two displayed on the dance floor has extended to their personal lives.
Chmerkovskiy joked about it during the show's finale.
"I want to ravage her and have ice-skating, big, Russian, mean babies," he said. "We're going to call them Boris and Oleg. Their nicknames are going to be Bear. Both. One nickname for both."
