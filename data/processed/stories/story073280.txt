A new Miss World was crowned Saturday, and though she competed as Miss Philippines, she hails from the United States.
Megan Young, 23, an aspiring filmmaker, took the top honor at the competition, held in Bali, Indonesia.
"No words! Thank you so much for everyone for choosing me. I promise to be the best Miss World ever," Young said.
Miss France, Marine Lorphelin, and Miss Ghana, Carranzar Naa Okailey Shooter, were second and third runners up, respectively.
Young was born in the United States and moved to the Philippines at age 10, according to her biography.
The new Miss World is a college student who has appeared on screen as an actress and presenter since she was 15.
Young wants to move behind the camera and become a director, according to her bio.
Miss World's 127 contestants competed in beach fashion, fitness, world fashion, talent and "Beauty with a Purpose" meant to honor charitable work. The top 10 models -- from Ukraine, South Sudan, Brazil, the Philippines, France, Cameroon, Cyprus, England, Italy and the United States -- were announced earlier this week.
Protesters in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, denounced the event.
In an attempt to appease religious concerns, the pageant scrapped the swimsuit competition and replaced it with less-revealing beachwear attire.
Also, the finals were originally to be held on the outskirts of Jakarta, but protesters forced the event to relocate to the Hindu resort island of Bali.
CNN's Neda Farshbaf, Mary Primiano, Kathy Quiano and Madison Park contributed to this report.
