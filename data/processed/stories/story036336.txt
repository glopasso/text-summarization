For the second time in a month, a man has been shoved to his death in front of a train on a New York City subway platform, police said.
The New York Police Department on Friday identified the victim as Sunando Sen, 46, of Queens.
Police are searching for a woman seen running from an elevated station for the No. 7 train in Queens on Thursday evening, Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said in a statement.
According to witnesses, the woman was pacing the platform and talking to herself shortly before pushing the man onto the tracks as the 11-car train entered the station.
The man's body was pinned under the second car after it came to a stop.
Police describe her as a heavyset woman in her 20s, wearing a ski jacket and sneakers. Security video shows her running from the scene shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday.
Sen's roommate, Ar Suman, 33, told CNN on Friday that after living together for over a year they had become like "family."
"I came home and I heard this happened," said Suman, "I am feeling very bad."
Sen owned a shop called New Amsterdam Copies and was a graphic designer for posters, according to Suman.
In early December, Ki-Suck Han, 58, was shoved onto the tracks in a Times Square station as a train approached.
Naeem Davis, 30, a homeless man, has been charged with second-degree murder in that case.
CNN's Jesse Solomon and Rande Iaboni contributed to this report.
