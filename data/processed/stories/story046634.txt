(Mashable) -- As a part of the 25th anniversary of Toshiba's laptop business, the company unveiled a dual-screen laptop concept named the Libretto W100.
Although Toshiba calls it a concept PC, it looks very finished and ready for market release, which Toshiba claims will be later this summer, albeit in a limited capacity (the price is reported to be $1099). As far as specifications go, one thing definitely stands out: dual 7.0-inch multi-touch displays with 1024×600 pixel resolution, together with a virtual keyboard with haptic response.
It's powered by an Intel Pentium U5400 CPU operating at 1.2 GHz, 2 GB of DDR3 memory, and a 64 GB SSD, which makes it a fairly powerful machine. Other specs include a 1-megapixel webcam, Bluetooth, MicroSD card, Wi-Fi, one USB port, an 8-cell battery, while the operating system is Windows 7.
It's also a very portable device, measuring merely 4.84 inches by 7.95 inches when closed, and weighing 1.8lbs.
