(PEOPLE.com) -- Giuliana Rancic is in good spirits after undergoing a successful double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery on Tuesday.
"G is doing really well," husband Bill Rancic told "E! News." "Her surgery lasted about four hours and the doctors were very pleased with the result."
The E! Host, 37, decided to have a double mastectomy after lumpectomies failed to eradicate her breast cancer.
"She had a little bit of pain through the night but is feeling much better this morning and was cracking jokes," Bill said.
While Giuliana recently told PEOPLE that her world had been turned upside down since being diagnosed three months ago, she's determined to fight the disease.
"My breasts have never defined me -- and now they never will," she said.
