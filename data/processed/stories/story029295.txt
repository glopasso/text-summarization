R. Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law to former President John F. Kennedy who was the first head of the Peace Corps, has been hospitalized in Maryland, a hospital spokeswoman said Monday.
Ronna Borenstein-Levy of Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, a suburb of Washington, D.C., provided no further details on Shriver, who is 95 and has Alzheimer's disease.
Shriver had roles in many top government initiatives of the 1960s, including Head Start and the Peace Corps. He also worked with his wife, the late Eunice Kennedy Shriver, on the Special Olympics. Mrs. Shriver died in 2009.
In addition, Shriver was Democrat George McGovern's running mate in the 1972 presidential election won by Richard Nixon.
Shriver is the father of Maria Shriver, the wife of former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
