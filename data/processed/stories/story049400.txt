Is she or isn't she?
People magazine is not citing the source in its report that Eva Mendes and Ryan Gosling are expecting a baby in October.
Given the fact that the pair have been less than public about their reported romantic relationship, it's no surprise that neither has commented or confirmed the report.
But the Internet don't need no stinking official confirmation.
There was much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth over the news that one of Hollywood's most desired male stars may soon be a father.
"HE WROTE HER 365 LETTERS PEOPLE. It's over. #babymendes is here to stay and ruin our lives. #TheNotebook #gosbaby," one fan tweeted.
And of course there were memes.
"This is happening in real life, you guys. #EvaMendes is carrying #RyanGosling's #baby! #HeyGirl," one meme said with a picture of Gosling and Mendes and a baby from their film "The Place Beyond the Pines."
Even celebs got in on the fun.
Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres tweeted "Congrats to @RyanGosling and @EvaMendes! That's going to be the most beautiful, bilingual, part-superhero, well-dressed, romantic baby ever."
Your move, Eva and Ryan.
