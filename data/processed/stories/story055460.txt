Bayern Munich maintained their perfect start to the Bundesliga season with a 2-0 win away to Werder Bremen on Saturday.
Two late goals from Luiz Gustavo and Mario Mandzukic sealed a sixth straight win for Jupp Heynckes' side and stretch their lead over Frankfurt -- who play Freiburg on Sunday -- to five points.
Gustavo's 81st minute effort gave Bayern the lead as the match looked to be heading for a draw with Mandzukic scoring three minutes later to seal all three points.
"We were too slow in the first half and my players tested my patience a bit. I had to find hard words for my halftime talk and in the end it was enough for a win against a tough Bremen side," Heynckes said.
Reigning champions Borussia Dortmund routed Moenchengladbach 5-0 to rise to third in the table.
Marco Reus scored a brace against his old club with defender Neven Subotic, Ilkay Guendogan and Jakub Blaszczykowski also getting on the score sheet.
Elsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen are up to seventh in the table after beating Greuther Fuerth 2-0, while Stuttgart enjoyed their first win of the season, beating Nuremberg by the same scoreline.
Hamburg also claimed a valuable three points with a 1-0 win over Hannover.
Bottom-of-the-table Augsburg played out a goalless draw at Hoffenheim in a game overshadowed by concern for Boris Vukcevic.
The 22-year-old Hoffenheim midfielder is in a critical condition after his car collided with a truck on Friday.
Both players and fans at Saturday's match showed their support with banners and t-shirts bearing Vukcevic's name.
