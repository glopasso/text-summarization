Rafael Nadal made light work of Marcos Daniel in his first grass outing of the season at the Aegon Championships in London.
The world number one took just 50 minutes to win 6-2 6-2 over the Brazilian serve-and-volleyer at the Queen's Club.
Just three days after securing his fifth French Open title in Paris, Nadal showed little sign of heavy legs, in securing his 23rd successive victory.
Nadal raced into a 3-0 lead in the opening set before Daniel saved a series of break points to get back in the match. Nadal broke again with the score at 5-2 to seal the set.
A short rain break delayed the game in the second set but Nadal broke to lead 4-2 when the players returned, before closing out the set.
When asked whether Sunday's victory in Paris was still on his mind, Nadal told the official ATP Tour Web site: "Oh, sure it is still on my mind because it was emotional moment for me.
"I'm happy to be playing on grass another time, because for me I enjoy [it] a lot because I have to do different things.
"For me it is always a challenge to be here and to practice these new things: the serve, the volley, the slice, return more inside than clay. So I enjoy doing this transition. After Wimbledon, I'm going to have time to enjoy the victory of Roland Garros and to enjoy Majorca."
Nadal will now meet Uzbekistani Denis Istomin after he beat Dustin Brown, from Jamaica, 7-6 6-4.
Second seed Novak Djokovic also enjoyed a comfortable straight sets win over Italian Paolo Lorenzi. The Serb won 6-3 6-3 in just 73 minutes.
Elsewhere, eighth seed Feliciano Lopez beat Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 6-2 6-4, while ninth seed Julien Benneteau, from France, edged past South African Kevin Anderson 7-5 6-3.
