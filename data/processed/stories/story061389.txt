Dr. Ken Yeang is the world's leading architect in ecological and passive low energy design. He has delivered over 200 built projects and his 'bioclimatic' towers have had an impact around the world, fusing high-tech and organic principles.
Born in Penang, Malaysia in 1948, Yeang was educated there, as well as in the U.S. and the UK, receiving his doctorate in Architecture from Cambridge University, and attending graduate courses at the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard.
His expertise in the field of green design originated from his early doctoral dissertation from Cambridge University (1971-1974) followed by his ongoing R&D work, which has since led to the publication of a number of his treatises on the topic of ecological design and planning, bioclimatic design and high-rise design.
His publications include: "The Skyscraper: Bioclimatically Considered," "The Green Skyscraper: The Basis for Designing Sustainable, Intensive Buildings," and his latest book "Ecodesign: A manual for Ecological Design."
He is a member of the RIBA and is registered with ARB. Over his 35 years of professional practice, he has seen to completion over a hundred projects on site, including having designed over 50 skyscrapers, with over 12 completed, and currently three towers in construction.
He is best known as the inventor of the Bioclimatic skyscraper (as a genre of low-energy skyscrapers based on bioclimatic design principles), and for his novel ideas on designing the high-rise building type as vertical urban design. E-mail to a friend
