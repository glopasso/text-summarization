When the NBA's most popular player Lebron James re-signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers this summer, he announced it by posting a photo on his Instagram account. Not Twitter -- the favored social vehicle outlet for so many celebrities -- but Instagram.
The player's choice in social media reflected the apparent demise of Twitter's cool factor.
Two months later, Twitter has dropped off the top 20 coolest brands list for the first time in three years. Its rival Instagram has made its first appearance in the elite club.
The annual CoolBrands Top 20 ranking is based on a survey of independent influencers and over 2,000 British consumers.
Although there is no exact definition of "coolness," the judges are asked to consider the brands' style, innovation, originality, authenticity, desirability and uniqueness.
Apple retained its position as the coolest brand, despite suffering a blow to its reputation when it  added music in people's libraries without asking.
High-end luxury brands continue to dominate the ranking with Aston Martin, CHANEL, Dom Perignon and Rolex all making appearance in the top 10.
"If anything, this year's CoolBrands rankings illustrate that a solid reputation is hard to undermine or, in the case of rivals, overcome," the head of CoolBrands Council Stephen Cheliotis said.
In total, 13 brands retained their Top 20 status from last year. Prada, Adidas and Mercedes-Benz all lost their spots among the leading cool brands.
The U.S. streaming and DVD service Netflix broke into the top 20 for the first time, a result of its popularity rising in Europe.
