A magnitude 3.8 earthquake in southern California struck San Bernardino County near the San Andreas Fault Saturday morning, but no major damage was reported, authorities said.
The quake's epicenter was two miles northwest of Devore, California, where residents told CNN affiliate KCAL that their homes shook, without damage, authorities said.
"It's not on the San Andreas fault. It's located very close to it," seismologist Lucy Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey told KCAL.
Added John Bellini of the U.S. Geological Survey: "It's capable of knocking items from shelves and maybe cracking plaster."
USGS originally put the magnitude at 4.1 before revising it to 3.8.
The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department in nearby Rancho Cucamonga told CNN that it didn't receive reports of major damage shortly after the quake.
"It was a solid boom and everything shook," Devore resident Tracie Thompson told KCAL. "None of the china moved or anything. It was over so quickly. It was really a harsh jolt to the house."
Devore is about a 55-mile drive northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
The region is known as the Inland Empire, east of Los Angeles.
CNN's Michael Martinez reported from Los Angeles and Kara Devlin from Atlanta.
