(EW.com) -- Now Shailene Woodley can pursue that film career fulltime: ABC Family has decided not to renew the five-year-old "The Secret Life of the American Teenager" for another season.
The drama from Brenda Hampton ("7th Heaven") will air the first of its final 12 episodes beginning in March, according to Deadline.
"Teenager" not only served as a springboard for the Golden Globe-nominated Woodley â€” who starred in "The Descendants" opposite George Clooney â€” but served as a beacon of light for the Down Syndrome community because it cast Luke Zimmerman as Tom, the high-functioning son of Kathleen (Josie Bissett).

The drama that addressed teen pregnancy first bowed in 2008.
