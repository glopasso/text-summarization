Chile's Supreme Court has ruled that former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori can be extradited to Peru on five corruption and two human rights abuse charges.
Former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori has denied all allegations, calling them politically motivated.
Alberto Chaigneau, a court judge, made the announcement about the order on Chilean TV on Friday.
Gabriel Zaliasnek, Fujimori's defense attorney, later said that the "decision of the Supreme Court should be respected and will be respected."
It is not known when the extradition will take place. But the wheels for extradition were set in motion a couple of months ago.
A Chilean prosecutor in June recommended that Fujimori be extradited to Peru to face the charges.
He was then placed under house arrest in his home in the suburbs of the Chilean capital, Santiago while awaiting a Supreme Court ruling.
Before moving to Chile, Fujimori had fled Peru for Japan, where he holds dual citizenship, as his decade-long presidency neared its end in 2000.
Japan refused to honor Peru's request to return him for trial, saying its nationals should be subject to Japanese law and pointing out the two countries have no extradition treaty.
He attempted to resign from the presidency by fax from Japan, but Peru's congress refused to accept it, instead declaring him morally unfit to govern.
He arrived in Chile in 2005, in what some saw as a possible attempt to return to Peru and seek office there in 2006. He was under house arrest for six months in Chile, but authorities lifted the restriction last year on the condition he not leave the country.
Peru has alleged Fujimori ordered death-squad killings and participated in various acts of government corruption. He has denied all the allegations, calling them politically motivated. E-mail to a friend
