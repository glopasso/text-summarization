A liner carrying nearly 2,000 passengers ran into trouble Saturday in Finland's Aland archipelago in the northern Baltic Sea.
Viking Line said its liner, M/S Amorella, had "touched slightly aground" at about lunchtime local time.
None of the 1,945 passengers was injured and the situation on board the ship is calm, a statement on Viking Line's website said.
The company plans to try to move the ship to the port of Langnas on Saturday evening.
The ship is not letting in water, but a small leak has been observed on a ballast tank that normally holds water, it said.
All the passengers remain on board and are safe, it said.
The Amorella, launched in 1988, measures nearly 170 meters (185 yards) long and can carry as many as 2,480 passengers.
