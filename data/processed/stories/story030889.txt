After an hours-long search on Wednesday, former model and celebrated restaurateur B. Smith has been found.
The 65-year-old, who has Alzheimer's disease, was last seen taking a jitney from New York to the Hamptons on Tuesday, reports CNN affliate WABC.
When she didn't show up at her destination, Smith's husband, Dan Gasby, reported her missing and asked the public for help.
By Wednesday afternoon, Smith was found by her daughter at a restaurant in New York City, not far from a former residence, WABC reports. It appears that Smith got off the jitney at the wrong stop, and then returned to New York.
Smith's husband told the news station that his wife had never gotten lost before.
The groundbreaking talent, who in 1976 became one of the first African-American women to land the cover of Mademoiselle magazine, opened up to CBS' "Sunday Morning" in June about being diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
"It feels like crying," Smith said of the diagnosis. "Things like that make me very sad."
Still, "even with Alzheimer's, I think that things are gonna work out," Smith continued. "I'm gonna do my best to make it work out for me, and for as many people that I can possibly help, too."
In addition to modeling and acting, Smith built a restaurant and home entertaining empire. Smith has opened restaurants in New York and Washington, D.C., authored cookbooks and released a line of home goods.
