Peshawar is the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the gateway to Pakistan's tribal region, which is largely ungoverned and has a strong militant presence.
For more than a decade, Peshawar has been on the front line for the Pakistani government's fight with militant groups such as the Taliban. A major terrorist attack near the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar in April 2010 killed at least 25 people.
Who are the Pakistani Taliban?
The area where the attack took place Wednesday is known as the Storytellers Market. It is one of the oldest markets in the country and predates the creation of Pakistan in 1947.
