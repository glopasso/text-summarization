Arnold Schwarzenegger is, uh, back.
And so is the whole "Terminator" universe: morphing machines, the industrious version of Sarah Connor and a sometimes-befuddled Kyle Reese.
The trailer for "Terminator: Genisys" hit the Web on Thursday, and it appears to have amped up the action to video game levels. How else to explain Schwarzenegger's old-style Terminator -- who has apparently raised young Sarah -- hurtling through the air into the blades of a helicopter? (It's OK. He'll repair himself, right? Right?)
Of course, there are still the "Terminator" touchstones: post-apocalyptic landscapes, a naked Reese showing up in 1980s Los Angeles, crazy physics-defying stunts (how about that school bus?) and a blade-equipped T-1000.
And, yes, Schwarzenegger, looking a little older but still as determined as ever.
"I'll be back," he says before leaping into that helicopter.
"Terminator: Genisys" has some changes in store, producer David Ellison told EW in October.
"Since (Sarah Connor) was 9 years old, she has been told everything that was supposed to happen," he said. "But Sarah fundamentally rejects that destiny. She says, 'That's not what I want to do.' It's her decision that drives the story in a very different direction."
The film stars Emilia Clarke as Connor and Jai Courtney as Reese. It's scheduled to open July 1.
