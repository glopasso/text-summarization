Rescue workers have pulled a body from underneath the rubble of a collapsed apartment building in Cologne, Germany, police spokeswoman Astrid Gelss told CNN.
The remains of Cologne's archive building following the collapse on Tuesday afternoon.
The apartment building collapsed together with two other buildings on March 3.
Initially as many as nine people were reported missing, but after seven of them reported to the authorities that they were safe, search and rescue efforts focused on finding the two remaining missing men.
Rescue workers found the body at about 2 a.m. Sunday morning (8 p.m. ET Saturday). It has not been identified.
The search for the second missing person is still ongoing, Gelss said.
It is still not clear what caused the collapse of the building which contained the city's historical archives, bringing down parts of the two nearby structures.
CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.
