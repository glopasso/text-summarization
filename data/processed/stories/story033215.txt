An Israeli airstrike killed two men in Gaza City on Friday afternoon, Palestinian medical sources said -- an attack that the Israeli military says targeted people involved in recent rocket attacks against Israel.
The Israeli aircraft fired at a vehicle about 3:15 p.m., killing the two men, the Palestinian sources said.
Israel's military said the strike in northern Gaza targeted two men who "were involved in the rockets launched at Israel in the passing week."
The men "were also involved in several terror attacks against Israel over the past few years and were planning further attacks against Israel and its civilians," the military said.
Palestinian security sources said the men were affiliated with the Tawhid Brigades, a radical Islamist group.
The Israeli military said that 30 rockets were launched from Gaza toward Israel in the last two weeks. No injuries were reported in Israel, though the military said one of the rockets landed in Gaza, killing a girl and wounding another there.
Explosive used against Israeli tank
Earlier Friday, an explosive device was used against an Israeli tank near the border with southern Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian sources said.
Israeli forces responded with tank fire aimed at "lookout posts used to guide the attack," an Israeli Defense Ministry official said. The official confirmed one hit.
The tank was operating near a security fence that runs along the border with southern Gaza at the time of the explosion, the official said. No one was injured in the explosion.
Palestinian officials confirmed the detonation of an IED, saying it happened on the Gaza side of the border as the tank neared the fence. The officials said that the Israeli tank fire struck two Mosque minarets east of Khan Younis, as well as residential homes.
Seven people suffered light to moderate injuries, Palestinian officials said.
