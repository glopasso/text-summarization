Whether they're blasting over the tracks in Germany or Japan, trains offer travelers a chance to sit back and relax as they ride through some of the world's most incredible scenery.
But often the stations the trains depart from are an attraction in their own right, counting among the world's most beautiful pieces of architecture.
Hamburg-based architectural data company, Emporis just released a list of 11 of the world's most spectacular train stations.
"Increasing numbers of cities are adorning themselves with eye-catching station buildings that, with their unconventional roof structures, bright colors and extravagant shapes, become unique architectural landmarks of those cities," the report says.
The 11 stations include the artistic Hundertwasser Bahnhof in Germany, decorated in the style of artist Friedensreich; futuristic Gare de Liege-Guillemins in Belgium, with its "gigantic arched roof that spans the entire length of the station"; and the soon-to-be-completed World Trade Center Transportation Hub in New York "that will set new standards in station architecture."
The report adds that historical stations are now being eyed for elaborate and unusual renovations.

King's Cross in London and Gare de Strasbourg in France, for instance, are among stations that are now part modern art and part historical landmarks.
Meanwhile, architectural masterpieces like Grand Central Terminal in New York and Chhaatrapati Shivaji Terminus in Mumbai are equally as impressive today as they were when opening in 1913 and 1888, respectively.
Check out the above gallery for Emporis' full list of spectacular train stations.
