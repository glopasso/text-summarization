(CNN)  -- Arsenal and Hull City were charged with failing to control their players by the English Football Association (FA) on Wednesday after their fiery Premier League match on December 19.
The match at the Emirates Stadium, won 3-0 by title-chasing Arsenal, became heated just before halftime when Arsenal's Samir Nasri clashed with Hull's Richard Garcia.
Stephen Hunt then had a confrontation with Nasri and a mass brawl ensued, with home goalkeeper Manuel Almunia running the length of the field to get involved.
Referee Steve Bennett had to battle to get things under control and then showed yellow cards to both Hunt and Nasri.
The clubs have until January 13 to launch any appeal.
In other Premier League news on Wednesday, Liverpool could give Italian midfielder Alberto Aquilani his full debut for the crucial Boxing Day clash with Wolves.
Aquilani, a big summer signing from AS Roma, has yet to start a league game for Liverpool, having battled to recovery from an ankle injury.
Manager Rafael Benitez has been criticized for his reluctance to play Aquilani, but with the player recovering from a calf injury which kept him out of last weekend's match all the indicators are that he will take his place at Anfield.
Premier League champions Manchester United have been clearance to play Senegal striker Mame Biram Diouf after he was granted a work permit.
United signed Diouf from Molde in July before loaning him back to the Norwegian club.
He scored 16 goals in 29 games in Norway and with Senegal failing to qualify for  the African Cup of Nations, United have pressed to get him the proper clearances.
