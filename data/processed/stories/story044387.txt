Iraqi lawmakers approved a new government Monday and tapped former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki as one of the country's three vice presidents.
Several key Cabinet posts remain vacant.
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi vowed to have nominations for the defense and interior minister posts ready to present to Parliament within a week.
Monday's Parliament vote, just a day before a constitutional deadline, comes as Iraq faces political turmoil and battles a surge of Islamist militants from ISIS.
Along with al-Maliki, former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and former speaker of Parliament Osama al-Nujaifi will also serve as vice presidents. Allawi and Al-Maliki are longtime political foes.
