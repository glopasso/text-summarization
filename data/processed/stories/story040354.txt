Borussia Dortmund moved seven points clear in the German Bundesliga with a 2-0 victory over fellow title hopefuls Hamburg in front of a sellout home crowd of 80,720 on Friday night.
Japan midfielder Shinji Kagawa scored the opener four minutes after halftime, and was also involved as Paraguay forward Lucas Barrios killed off the visitors with 19 minutes to play.
It was Dortmund's 10th victory in 12 league matches this season, with Jurgen Klopp's team unbeaten since losing on the opening day in August.
"It took us a while to get into the game, but things worked better for us after the break," Klopp told AFP, with the club seeking a first league crown since 2002.
"Hamburg came back into the game late on, which made life hard for us. But we are very happy with the win."
In the 49th minute, Lukas Piszczek found space to pick out Kagawa, and the midfielder fired in a shot that deflected off Hamburg defender Heiko Westermann for his sixth goal this season.
Kagawa initiated the move that doubled the lead, with Barrios claiming his seventh of the campaign from Kevin Grosskreutz's cross.
The result left Hamburg in seventh place in a group of four clubs on 18 points ahead of Saturday's matches.
Second-placed Mainz, who have 24 points, host Hannover and third-placed Bayer Leverkusen travel to St. Pauli.
Elsewhere, Werder Bremen host Eintracht Frankfurt, Wolfsburg are at home to struggling Schalke, Cologne face Borussia Monchengladbach in a battle of the bottom two clubs, and Stuttgart travel to Kaiserslautern in another lower-table affair.
On Sunday, ninth-placed defending champions Bayern Munich will seek to reduce the 15-point deficit on Dortmund with victory at home to Nuremberg, while fifth-placed Hoffenheim host Freiburg.
