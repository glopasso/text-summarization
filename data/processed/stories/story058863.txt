A 30-car accident and bad weather caused the closure Monday of Interstate 70 in and around Vail, Colorado, a state transportation spokeswoman said.
"We were seeing blizzard conditions up in that area," said Mindy Crane of the Colorado Department of Transportation. "We have not been able to find out if there are any injuries or fatalities."
Part of the highway was shut down eastbound around 1:30 p.m. MT (3:30 p.m. ET). Crane said around 4:20 p.m. MT that it could be several more hours before that part of the interstate fully reopens.

According to the National Weather Service, scattered snow showers in Vail -- home to one of the nation's best-known ski areas -- were expected to linger into Monday evening. Temperatures should be below freezing overnight, with wind chills making it feel like -15 degrees Fahrenheit.
Skiers there can expect sunny skies and a high temperature of 35 degrees on Tuesday.
The Colorado state transportation agency reported other closures Monday afternoon along I-70 from the same weather system.
That includes a stretch of eastbound I-70 northeast of Vail, between Frisco and Silverthorne, and a longer westbound part of the highway between Georgetown and Silverthorne because of "multiple accidents."
By 7 p.m., all parts of the highway in Colorado had reopened, according to the state Department of Transportation's website.
