A federal air marshal was arrested Thursday morning at Nashville International Airport after being caught taking multiple upskirt pictures of female passengers boarding a plane, police said.
A witness spotted 28-year-old Adam Bartsch, who was on duty, taking pictures with his cell phone underneath women's dresses, police said. The witness grabbed Bartsch's phone and notified a Southwest Airlines flight attendant, a police report said.
Airport police removed Bartsch from the flight and took him into custody.
According to the police report, Bartsch said he snapped 10 to 12 inappropriate pictures, something he said he had done before. He was charged with disorderly conduct and held on $10,000 bail.
The Transportation Security Administration said it is assisting authorities with the investigation.
"TSA does not tolerate criminal behavior. The agency immediately removed this individual from his current duties and is in the process of suspending or terminating his employment."
In an e-mail to CNN, Southwest Airlines spokesman Chris Mainz said the flight, to Tampa, Florida, was not delayed by the incident.
