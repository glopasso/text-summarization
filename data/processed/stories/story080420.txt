(PEOPLE.com) -- There may be an extra place setting around Jack Wagner's dinner table this holiday season -- and not just because he and longtime girlfriend Heather Locklear are no longer together.
Wagner, 52, discovered earlier this month that he has a long-lost 23-year-old daughter from a "fling" he had with the girl's mother in the late 1980s, TMZ reports.
The girl, named Carrie, introduced herself to Wagner backstage at a November 4 concert in Boca Raton, Florida. where the actor was performing with Rick Springfield.
Less than two weeks after the encounter, Wagner and Locklear announced they had called off their engagement, saying planning their wedding was not allowing them enough time to spend with their children.
Reports say Carrie, who was given up for adoption as an infant, had recently tried to track down her birth parents, a search that led her Wagner. Sources told TMZ that the two embraced at the Florida concert and, at a later performance, Wagner introduced her to the entire audience.
The newly expanded family appeared in public this week at the taping of the Hollywood Christmas Parade Tree Lighting Concert at Universal Citywalk, which will air December 12 on the Hallmark Channel. Carrie and Wagner's two other children cheered their father on as he performed two songs.
"They were completely having fun," according to an onlooker. "[Wagner] was in great spirits with his family. They were all celebrating together. The kids totally supported their dad, which was really cute."
