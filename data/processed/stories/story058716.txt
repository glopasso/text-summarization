Australian golfer Robert Allenby has written a new chapter in the volume of bizarre sporting injuries after tearing knee ligaments in a fishing accident.
The world No. 14 slipped on the deck his boat "C'mon Aussie" while on a weekend excursion in the Bahamas, and is expected to be out for at least three weeks after undergoing surgery.
Allenby was forced to withdraw from next week's U.S. PGA Championship, the final major tournament of the year.
It's not the first time the 39-year-old has had cause to rue his love of fishing. He almost sat out the U.S. Open in June after wrenching his left wrist and forearm when his boat ran aground.
Allenby is just the latest sports star to suffer a freak injury away from the field of play. In our photo gallery above, CNN World Sport takes a look at 10 of the most unusual.
