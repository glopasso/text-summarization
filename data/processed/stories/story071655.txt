It's a day that comes only once every 100 years -- 11/11/11. And in Vegas, that means throngs of lovebirds are flocking to chapels to get hitched Friday.
"We're surrounded by hundreds of couples who want to get married on 11/11/11," said the Rev. Charlotte Richards, owner of Little White Wedding Chapel on the Las Vegas Strip.
The chapel has 200 brides and grooms who are either getting hitched for the first time or are renewing their vows. In addition to a beautiful ceremony, Richards said she is offering bridal flowers and dog tags that have the 11/11/11 date inscribed on them.
Many couples booked their special day two years in advance.
At least 75 additional staff members were needed to accommodate the demand at Little White Wedding Chapel.
"We have 17 ministers, limousine drivers, greeters, videographers," Richards said.
In 30 of the weddings, an Elvis impersonator will serenade the couple.
Closer to downtown, the Viva Las Vegas Wedding Chapel is equally abuzz.
It has 190 weddings booked, with the first starting at midnight. That means about four weddings every 30 minutes throughout the day, with only a couple of hours of down time for a break.
General Manager Brian Mills calls his establishment "The Fun Chapel." Couples can have Blues Brothers or Marilyn Monroe impersonators as officiators. They can also have a Camelot-themed wedding or one with an Elvis impersonator, complete with a 1964 pink Cadillac convertible that drives the couple down the aisle.
The couples include 18- and 19-year-olds; military personnel who are about to get deployed and want a quick wedding; and some who are renewing their vows.
"Part of the thrill is that it'll be a day the couple won't forget -- as in it will be easy to remember your anniversary," Mills said.
He said he's already looking forward to 12/12/12.
