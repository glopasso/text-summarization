(Mashable) -- Twitter has taken a big step towards improving account security with a new setting that permanently enables HTTPS.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) allows encrypted communication between networks and users.
It creates a secure tunnel through the inherently chaotic web, decreasing the chance that somebody will access a user's account information on an open Wi-Fi network, for example.
Twitter has offered HTTPS access for some time. But starting today, users can activate HTTPS permanently by going to their settings and selecting "Always use HTTPS."
These users will always be logged into Twitter via HTTPS rather than the traditional HTTP method.

The company notes that its mobile website still can't force HTTPS permanently.
So users currently need to make sure they are logged into https://mobile.twitter.com rather than http://mobile.twitter.com if they want a secure connection.
Twitter says it is working on a solution that will make the permanent HTTPS feature work on both its mobile website and Twitter.com.
