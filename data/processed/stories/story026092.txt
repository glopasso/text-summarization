Ivory Coast international Emmanuel Eboue has completed his move from Arsenal to Turkish side Galatasaray, just one day after former Gunners captain Cesc Fabregas left the club to join European champions Barcelona.
Eboue, 28, has cost the Istanbul-based team $5 million and has signed a four-year contract at the Turk Telekom Arena.
The right-back joined Arsenal from Belgian side Beveren in 2005 and made 214 appearances for Arsene Wenger's side.
Fabregas signs five-year Barcelona contract
"Arsenal have agreed terms with Turkish side Galatasaray for the transfer of Emmanuel Eboue," read a statement on Arsenal's official web site.
"Everyone at Arsenal thanks Emmanuel for his contribution towards the club and wishes him the best of luck for the future."
Eboue was a member of the Arsenal side beaten in the 2006 Champions League final by Barcelona -- and has played for the Ivory Coast at the last two World Cups -- Germany 2006 and South Africa 2010.
Another player leaving the Emirates Stadium is Mexican striker Carlos Vela, who has joined Spanish side Real Sociedad on loan.
What now for Arsenal and Fabregas?
Vela spent the second half of last season on loan at West Bromwich Albion, where he scored two goals in 12 appearances.
In the wake of Fabregas' departure on Monday, Arsenal have announced Dutch international striker Robin van Persie will take over as club captain.
Van Persie, 28, joined Arsenal from Feyernoord in 2004 and was their top scorer last season with 18 league goals.
Another club busy in the transfer market on Tuesday were 2010 Europa League winners Porto, who have agreed a deal with Belgian side Standard Liege for midfielder Steven Defour and defender Eliaquim Mangala.
Defour, 23, has 30 caps for the Belgian national side and was part of the Standard squad which claimed back-to-back league titles in 2008 and 2009.
French under-21 defender Mangala made his Standard debut in 2008 and was also part of the 10-time Belgian champions' victorious squad in 2009.
