Authorities in Mexico have arrested Gilberto Barragan Balderas, one of the leaders of a powerful drug dealing group called the Gulf Cartel, police said.
Mexican police said they arrested him Friday in the border city of Reynosa.
He was also wanted in the United States, and the State Department had offered a $5 million reward for his capture.
Barragan Balderas, 41, was responsible for various drug trafficking operations to the United States via the border between Tamaulipas, Mexico, and Texas, police said.
Police learned that the suspect was going to attend a party Friday and used that information to locate him.
