Police issued an "all clear" after an electronic greeting card prompted employees at a commercial Israeli bank in New York  to call emergency personnel, according to Paul Browne, a New York City Police Department spokesman.
Authorities said they initially X-rayed the package and were concerned that it was "a possible letter bomb," he said.
The card contained interconnecting wires and batteries and drew a New York bomb squad to investigate.
A law enforcement source told CNN that the letter was addressed to a bank employee.
Multiple emergency vehicles and as many as 20 firefighters gathered around the building in Manhattan.
Employees who left the building were not permitted re-enter it, according to CNN producer Kiran Khalid, but authorities did not evacuate the area.
