A 9-year-old rapper's adult-themed music videos are finding some new viewers -- Massachusetts child welfare authorities.
The child, Luie Rivera Jr., whose stage name is "Lil Poopy," is seen in videos posted online, including on YouTube, smacking a woman's backside, flashing wads of cash, riding in a Ferrari and rapping about how "coke is not a bad word."
A separate video shows the young performer in a nightclub with a dancing woman in a sexually suggestive position, with people in the crowd throwing cash.
The Brockton, Massachusetts, police department contacted the state's Department of Children and Families after receiving a call from a "concerned citizen" who saw the boy in videos featuring sexual themes and drug references. The state agency is brought in when there is suspicion of physical, mental, or emotional abuse of a child, according to Brockton police Lt. Robert Sergio.
"An investigation is now open," said Cayenne Isaksen, public affairs director for the state agency. Isaksen would not discuss details about the investigation, but added that non-emergency investigations typically take no longer than 15 days.
Lil Poopy is a member of internationally known, Moroccan-born rapper French Montana's group, Coke Boys.
According to CNN affiliate WCVB, Luis Rivera, Lil Poopy's father, says his son is "not doing anything wrong," and that he planned on contacting his lawyer.
CNN has been unable to independently reach the elder Rivera.
Sergio said Monday that no court orders are in place and no criminal charges have been filed.
