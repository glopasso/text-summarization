Advice can be a tricky thing.
If it's unsolicited advice from your mother -- or any advice from your mother, really -- it'll likely go in one ear and out the other.
But if that same advice comes from a favorite mentor or best friend, it can change your life.
Dhani Jones is a former NFL linebacker, entrepreneur and author of "The Sportsman: Unexpected Lessons From an Around-the-World Sports Odyssey." He's shared his best advice with CNN for a new Digital Studios series called "Be a Champion."
In the video above, Jones says he always tries to make a great first impression by dressing well -- without spending a lot of money.
