There's now one more Kardashian to keep up with.
On Saturday -- according to E!, the network behind her family's hit reality show-- Kim Kardashian gave birth to a baby girl. The report did not give a name for the newborn, but did say she came into the world at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
She's the first child for the 32-year-old Kardashian, who has modeled, acted and launched business ventures but is best known as a reality TV star with a huge international following, having amassed some 18 million Twitter followers
The father is rapper Kanye West, who was by his girlfriend's side during the delivery, E! reported, citing a source. The couple started dating last year, shortly after Kardashian filed for divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries after 72 days of marriage.
Kardashian's divorce is finally final
While the baby's arrival was somewhat unexpected -- coming a few weeks earlier than the July due date -- her gender is not. Like many aspects of the Kardashian family's existence, it was revealed on an episode of "Keeping Up with the Kardashians" -- the eighth season premiere, in fact, that aired in June -- documenting her 19-week checkup at her obstetrician's office.
"I'm so excited we're having a girl. Who doesn't want a girl? I think they are the best," Kardashian said then. "I know that's really what Kanye has always wanted. He wanted a little girl."
Kardashian's newborn daughter is the third grandchild of Kris Jenner -- the former wife of the late Robert Kardashian, best known as a lawyer for O.J. Simpson. Jenner is currently married to Olympic legend Bruce Jenner.
Kardashian's sister, Kourtney Kardashian, has two children -- Mason and Penelope -- with her longtime boyfriend, Scott Disick.
As to her own pregnancy, Kim Kardashian told Ryan Seacrest this spring that she didn't experience morning sickness, though it has been "really painful everywhere."
