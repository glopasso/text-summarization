Dallas police Saturday said DNA evidence has provided a breakthrough in an investigation of nine sexual assaults in South Dallas this summer.
Police asked for the public's help in locating Van Dralan Dixson, 38, who is named in an arrest warrant for aggravated sexual assault. His DNA matched evidence gathered in one case, a police statement said. Samples for other cases are awaiting analysis.
Dallas police had said officers were "saturating" the area of the attacks and that a task force had been created to investigate the crimes.
Police have said a single suspect was believed responsible for attacks on nine victims from June 22 through September 1.
All of the victims were walking between midnight and 6 a.m. when an armed man forced them to nearby secluded areas. The victims were robbed and sexually assaulted.
Victims said the attacker covered his face with a mask or bandanna, CNN affiliate WFAA-TV reported.
WFAA said a sexual assault was reported near an abandoned store in the same area early Saturday. Police did not immediately say whether that attack was similar to the previous nine.
