The death toll from a massive landslide that struck in Washington state's Cascade Mountains rose to 36 on Wednesday, the Snohomish County medical examiner said.
Of those 36 bodies, 32 have been identified, county officials said.
Ten people are still missing after a rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the rural town of Oso on March 22.
President Barack Obama has announced he will visit the area on April 22, the one month anniversary of the slide, and meet with search crews.
Search crews have been digging through deep, gelatinous mud and debris, which is 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing.
