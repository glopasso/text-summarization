Berry and Aubry have engaged in a long battle over custody of the child, culminating in a driveway brawl between Aubry and Martinez. The parents later reached a legal agreement, details of which are not known.
Berry, 46, won the Academy Award for best actress for her performance in 2001 "Monster's Ball."
