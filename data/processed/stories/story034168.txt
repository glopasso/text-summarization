Facetime with Saad Hariri, Leader of Future Movement
Saad Hariri is the leader of Lebanon's majority party, Future Movement.
Lebanon's economic growth may have slipped from an estimated 7 percent to 4 percent so far this year, but according to politician and businessman Saad Hariri, the country should largely escape the effects of the global slowdown.
The leader of Lebanon's majority party talks to MME about the credit crisis, its impact on remittances, and how he believes peace in the Middle East is the only way to bring political and economic stability to his country.
