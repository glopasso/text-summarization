Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes refused to say whether she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, instead deflecting the question by insisting that her race "isn't about the President."
"I respect the sanctity of the ballot box and I know that members of this editorial board do as well," she said. "I don't think the President is on the ballot as much as Mitch McConnell might want him to be."
Some Republicans were quick to notice the awkward moment and post the short clip to YouTube.
She did, however, lend her support to another major Democratic political figure: Former President Bill Clinton.
"I think Kentuckians know I'm a Clinton Democrat through and through." Clinton, an active campaigner for Grimes, is a decades-old friend of Grimes father, the former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party.
Grimes' refusal to say whether she voted for Obama is the most recent in a series of attempts to distance herself with an unpopular President, who endures a meager 35% job approval rating in the Bluegrass State, according to an October Fox poll.
On her campaign website, Grimes calls Obama's policies on coal "misguided," arguing that his efforts "harm hard-working Kentuckians and their families."
The energy-rich state is known for its coal industry, prompting Grimes to release a "Pro Coal plan" while other Democrats, including the President, have bristled at Kentucky's sky high carbon emissions.
And in September, the candidate made headlines when she wielded a shotgun in a campaign ad. "I'm not Barack Obama," Grimes, 35, says in the ad. "I disagree with him on guns, coal and the EPA."
Senate math seems impossible to some Democrats
