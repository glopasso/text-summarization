(CNN)A member of rapper Nicki Minaj's touring crew died and another was critically injured early Wednesday during a stabbing in Philadelphia.
"Two members of my team were stabbed last night in Philly. One was killed," Minaj tweeted.
"They had only been there for two days rehearsing for the tour."
Philadelphia police identified the victims as De'Von Pickett, 29, who went by Day Day, and Eric Parker, 27. They went to a bar with friends late Tuesday in Philadelphia's East Mount Airy neighborhood.
"They got into some type of verbal altercation with several other males which quickly escalated into a physical confrontation," Philadelphia police Capt. James Clark told CNN affiliate WPVI. "One of those males pulled out a knife and stabbed both of them multiple times."
They were taken to a local hospital, where Pickett was pronounced dead and Parker is in critical condition.
The stabber drove away from the bar. Police are checking surveillance video in the area, WPVI reported.
Singer/songwriter Candace Wakefield tweeted a picture of the victims.
"Praying for the families of E and Day Day," she said in a Twitter post. "These 2 were a joy to be around. Sending strength and ❤️ to @nickiminaj."
"These guys flew into Philly for my tour rehearsals 2 days ago and were both stabbed last night. #RIPDAYDAY," Minaj said on Instagram. "Condolences to your family. Unbelievable. ... Another senseless act of violence that took the life of a great guy. So sad."
Police are offering a $20,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the stabber, WPVI reported.
