Comedian and actor Kevin Hart says he'll straighten up his act. And he's not being funny.
Los Angeles traffic police arrested the stand-up comic on "suspicion" of drunken driving early Sunday.
They observed him speeding down a freeway at 90 mph in his black Mercedes, weaving across traffic lanes and almost running into a gas tanker truck, the California Highway Patrol said in a statement.
When patrol officers pursued him, he took an off ramp and pulled over, police said.
"Mr. Hart had objective signs of intoxication and was unable to perform the field sobriety tests," the statement read.
The comedian later tweeted: "When the cop asked me to take the sobriety test I said 'WHY WASTE OUR TIME ... I'M DRUNK MAN.'"
Police booked him into jail and held him on a $5,000 bond.
"This is a wake up call for me, I have to be smarter & last night I wasn't ... everything happens for a reason," he tweeted Sunday.
In a stand-up routine in his 2011 movie "Laugh At My Pain," Hart lampooned his father's alleged embarrassing behavior due to a drug addiction.
But he does not make light of his own intoxicated behavior.
"Drinking & driving is not a game or a laughing matter. People have lost lives because of stupid ... this!," he said on his verified Twitter account.
Hart has been in various movies, including "Think Like a Man" and "The Five-Year Engagement." He's also appeared in television shows, including "Modern Family."
