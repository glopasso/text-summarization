Three Pakistani police officers were found guilty of sexual exploitation and abuse of a 14-year-old Haitian boy while they were serving in a U.N. police mission in Haiti, a U.N. spokesman told reporters Tuesday.
The three were found guilty in a court-martial proceeding conducted by Pakistani authorities in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, said the spokesman, Martin Nesirky.
Pakistani authorities alerted Haitian officials to the outcome of the military procedure this month, saying that "the guilty parties will be punished, including dishonorable discharge from service, loss of benefits and imprisonment, with the latter sentence to be served immediately on return to Pakistan." Each is to serve a year in jail.
The three were in a Pakistani-formed police unit serving in Gonaives, Haiti, as part of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti in the wake of the devastating earthquake there in January 2010. The attack happened this January.
The three officers have been sent back to Pakistan. The U.N. spokesman said the international body is in contact with Pakistani authorities to "examine the formal details of the procedures and to ensure appropriate follow-up."
Asked by a reporter if the one-year sentence was appropriate for the crime, Nesirky responded, "The United Nations will not comment on the terms of the punishment under the member-states, the judicial procedure. That's obviously a matter between Pakistan and Haiti, but as we stated from the outset, the United Nations considers this to be a case of the most serious sexual exploitation and abuse."
In a separate case, five Uruguayan marines were accused last year of sexually assaulting a teenager at a U.N. base after a video was posted on the Internet. That case is still under investigation.
