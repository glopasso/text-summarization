Salt Cay, of the Turks Islands in the Caribbean, is the only place I've been told to keep to the left because livestock has right of way.
It's also the only place where I've had to wave down a passing airplane.
"Don't worry, man. You don't need a ticket to get back to Provo," I'm told as I stand on the beach. "Just stand on the airstrip, wave your hands in the air and the pilot will come and pick you up. No problem."
And he does.
I'm going to Providenciales ("Provo" to locals) island in the Turks and Caicos islands in the Caribbean to eat more than my fair share of trumpets.
"Titan's Trumpets," to be precise, also known as conch.

Having eaten conch in its cracked (fried), frittered, sweet 'n' sour, smoked and most memorably, at Turtle Cove's Terrace Restaurant, in its pecan-encrusted and wonton form, I eventually developed many attributes of the celebrated Caribbean gastropod.

Or quickly.
