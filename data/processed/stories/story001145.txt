Authorities believe they have found the final victim of a deadly landslide in Washington state.
A rain-saturated hillside along the Stillaguamish River gave way on the outskirts of the town of Oso on March 22.
Authorities announced Tuesday that workers found a body believed to be that of Molly Kristine "Kris" Regelbrugge. Local health officials will confirm the identification of the body once it's recovered.
"It is a testament to the persistence of the sheriff's office that today, four months after the slide, we recovered the final victim," Snohomish County Executive John Lovick said in a statement.
"The sheriff's search and rescue teams are true professionals. I am honored and humbled by their dedication and commitment to this community," he said.
Search crews had been digging through deep mud and debris, which was 70 feet thick in some places, to search for the missing.
Including Regelbrugge, 43 people are thought to have been killed in the March slide.
