A French tourist is recovering after falling 75 feet into the Grand Canyon, hospital officials said Saturday.
Witnesses reported that the 18-year-old was taking photographs when he slipped and fell over the edge, the National Park Service said in a statement.
He was in good condition at Flagstaff Medical Center early Saturday morning, spokeswoman Carrie Heinonen said.
He was being treated for neck, wrist and ankle injuries, the park service said.
Authorities said the man fell Thursday afternoon about a quarter mile east of Mather Point on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.
Park rangers rappelled into the canyon to assess the teen's injuries before a park helicopter airlifted him out.
