Federal authorities have arrested a third man they said was linked to the September kidnapping of a Georgia teenager.
In a press release Wednesday, the FBI said it arrested 28-year-old Tony Maurice Graves on Friday on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap.
The agency said Graves, along with 29-year-old Wildrego Jackson, who was arrested nearly a month ago, were involved in abducting 14-year-old Ayvani Perez on September 17 in Clayton County.
Also wanted in connection with Ayvani's abduction was 40-year-old Juan Alberto Contreras-Rodriguez, a Mexican national that authorities busted in a 2012 anti-drug trafficking raid. He is currently being held on immigration-related charges, according to the FBI.
According to a federal affidavit, the 36-hour drama began with two armed men demanding money and jewelry from Ayvani's mother. When the mother did not comply, the men took Ayvani, the affidavit said.
The same men later returned the girl unharmed to her aunt's house in Conyers, Georgia, the affidavit said. It remains unclear whether the abduction was random.
Phone calls abductors made to Ayvani's family demanding ransom and drugs allowed authorities to trace their phone records, which they said led to Jackson's arrest the next day.
Authorities have not detailed how the men were arrested.
