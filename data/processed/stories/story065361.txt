Six weeks after he was released from Taliban captivity, Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl spent his first day of regular duty working at the headquarters of U.S. Army North in Texas, the army said Tuesday.
Bergdahl, like many soldiers at a new assignment, spent much of his day on Monday getting paperwork straightened out, spokesman Don Manuszewski said.
The 28-year-old soldier spent five years in the hands of Taliban militants after he disappeared in Afghanistan in June 2009. After he was released in May in exchange for five senior Taliban members held by the U.S. military, Bergdahl has undergone counseling and been given medical care at a hospital in San Antonio.
On Monday, he began his job with a unit responsible for homeland defense, civil support operations and security cooperation programs involving countries such as Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas. He will eventually be given a position commensurate with his rank of sergeant. The army spokesman has said that Bergdahl would be assigned a desk job.
Bergdahl lives on base, in a two-bedroom unit in non-commissioned officers quarters.
"He's just another soldier in the U.S. Army," Manuszewski said.
He has two soldiers who are helping him adjust to life at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.

Bergdahl was a private first class when he was captured and the Army extended his enlistment and twice promoted him on schedule while in captivity.
Manuszewski wouldn't say how much longer Bergdahl's enlistment would last.
The news of Bergdahl's freedom initially was met with jubilation, but it quickly turned as many called for an investigation into his disappearance and captivity. Some critics accused the soldier of deserting his comrades in war.
Manuszewski didn't comment on the investigation.
Bergdahl has yet to be interviewed by the officer investigating his case, Lt. Colonel Alayne Conway said last week.
