An American imprisoned for nearly a month in the United Arab Emirates for taking photos has been released from custody and returning home to Georgia, a family spokeswoman said.
Robert Alan Black -- who'd  been in the UAE to speak at an international creativity conference -- had been held in Abu Dhabi's Al Wathba prison since October 21 after being "charged with taking pictures of restricted areas," said Rosemary Rein, the spokeswoman for Friends of Alan Black.
A former architect, Black often takes photos of buildings, according to Rein. Doing so is prohibited in some parts of the UAE, particularly in and around government buildings, embassies, military facilities and other places that are considered sensitive.
He made a brief court appearance Monday, and was released the following day.
"The court found that the action was committed with no ill-intention, and ordered the minimum fine of 500 (UAE dirhams or about US $135)," according to Rein's statement, which was posted to a "Free Robert Alan Black" Facebook page.
After his release, the 70-year-old headed to his home in Athens, Georgia.
"We're relieved and happy with this news," Rein said. "The international creativity community was concerned about our dear friend and colleague, and we're glad the matter has been resolved."
Black characterizes himself as an architect, cartoonist, graphic designer, professor and creativity consultant on his website. He has given presentations at more more than 150 creativity conferences on six continents since 1978, and has written more than 600 articles and a book, "Broken Crayons: Break Your Crayons and Draw Outside the Lines."
Rein has said Black's next stop, after the Abu Dhabi conference, was supposed to be Malaysia. But after noticing he hadn't posted to social media, she touched base with mutual acquaintances and learned that he'd never made it to Malaysia.
