Three U.S. Navy aviators are missing at sea after a command and control plane crashed over the Atlantic on Wednesday night, Navy officials said Thursday.
The E-2C Hawkeye is a command and control aircraft.
The E-2C  Hawkeye was conducting exercises off the Virginia-North Carolina coast.
The plane crashed after it launched from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman about 11 p.m. Wednesday, Navy officials said.
Navy officials said they do not know what caused the plane to crash, and search and rescue missions are under way from units on the Truman, the carrier USS Eisenhower and the Coast Guard.
The twin-engine plane usually carries a crew of five, but had only three aboard during the flight.
The plane was part of a training squadron, VAW 120, and is based at the Naval Station Norfolk in southern Virginia. E-mail to a friend
