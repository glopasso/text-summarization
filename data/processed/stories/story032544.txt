(CNN)Just after Thursday's Oscar nominations, the Critics' Choice Movie Awards moved the discussion forward on awards season Thursday night -- and the leader continues to be "Boyhood."
Richard Linklater's movie about growing up, shot over the course of 12 years, won best picture at the honors, which are given out by the Broadcast Film Critics Association.
But the awards didn't leave "Boyhood's" main competition, "Birdman" and "The Grand Budapest Hotel," bereft. "Birdman" earned trophies for best acting ensemble and star Michael Keaton, while "Budapest" took home the award for best comedy.
"Birdman" won seven awards overall.
Keaton had quite a night. Not only did he win, he apparently fell off stage after accepting his best actor award. The event wasn't captured on video, but a number of observers tweeted about it.
Keaton was fine and, being a trouper, later re-enacted the plunge backstage for the press.
"I took the 'Birdman' flying thing way too far," he joked.
Other winners included "The Lego Movie" -- snubbed by the Oscars -- as best animated feature, "Guardians of the Galaxy" for best action movie and J.K. Simmons for best supporting actor.
The awards weren't without their controversy. Host Michael Strahan led off the ceremony by doing a little stripping -- he has a part in the "Magic Mike" sequel -- and Judd Apatow, who presented the best director award, brought up Bill Cosby. Apatow, who was apparently a late addition to the presenters' lineup, has been a noted Cosby critic.
"They knew I'd be home tweeting about Cosby," Apatow said. "I was available."
