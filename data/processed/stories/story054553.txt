The Build-A-Bear Workshop company is recalling nearly 300,000 Colorful Hearts Teddy Bears sold in the United States and Canada due to risks of choking, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has announced.
The agency warned that while no injuries have been reported, the "teddy bear's eyes could loosen and fall out, posing a choking hazard to children," according to a statement.
"Consumers should immediately take the recalled teddy bear from children and return it to any Build-A-Bear store to receive a coupon for any available stuffed animal from Build-A-Bear," the statement said, advising buyers to contact the firm at 866-236-5683 with additional questions.
The Chinese-made toy is a stuffed animal, roughly 16 inches tall with black plastic eyes, that is sold in the United States for $18.
The bears were sold at Build-A-Bear Workshops and through the firm's website from April through December.
