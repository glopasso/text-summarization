A twin-engine propeller plane crashed into a house in North Carolina on Wednesday, killing two people on board, authorities said.
The small plane crashed into a High Point neighborhood -- clipping one home before crashing into a second and sparking a fire, said Capt. Denita Lynch of the city's fire department. The people inside the house at the time of the crash were able to escape unscathed.
The fire was extinguished.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, the plane was a Hawker Beechcraft BE58 en route to nearby Winston-Salem, but was diverted to nearby Greensboro's Piedmont Triad International Airport due to severe weather.
