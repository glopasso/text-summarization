The body of a retired firefighter, who was missing after apparently falling off a moving Amtrak train, was found Friday in Nebraska, the man's family said.
Charlie Dowd, 69, a retired San Francisco firefighter, was reported missing on September 14, Amtrak officials have said.
He was traveling to visit family and had spoke to his son by cell phone on September 13, saying he was just outside of Denver, according to his family.
But when his train arrived in Chicago, he was not on it. His luggage, cell phone and medication were found in his sleeping car, the family said on a Facebook page they set up to find him.
Amtrak officials had told Dowd's family that a door of the train was found ajar and passengers saw Dowd acting disoriented near a door.
On Friday, the body was spotted by a railway worker in the western Nebraska city of Haigler, the family said.
"While the family is devastated, they would like to express their gratitude for the many prayers, support, and messages posted to the Charlie Dowd Facebook page, and for the efforts of the many volunteers who have helped search for him this past week," a statement on the family's Facebook page said.
Amtrak officials said a coroner tentativley identified the body as Dowd.
"Amtrak employees are saddened by this development and the case remains an active investigation by the Amtrak Police and other agencies," Amtrak said in press statement.
