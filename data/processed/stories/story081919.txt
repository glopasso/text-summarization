Federal officials have cleared singer Justin Bieber and his fellow air passengers after an investigation into whether they interfered with a flight crew in January.
The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement Friday saying it has closed its investigation after it "found no evidence that the passengers violated Federal Aviation regulations."
CNN reported earlier that according to a law enforcement sources, Bieber and his father were "extremely abusive verbally" to a flight attendant during a flight on a chartered Gulfstream IV aircraft from Ontario, Canada, to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey in advance of the Super Bowl.
Justin Bieber and his father refused a pilot's repeated warnings to stop smoking pot on the flight, according to a report by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which was read to CNN.
Under FAA regulations, "No person may assault, threaten, intimidate, or interfere with a crew member in the performance of the crew member's duties aboard an aircraft."
