Imagine a night flight, 30,000 feet in the air, and being able to stare up at the stars through the plane's transparent fuselage.
This will be the flying experience in 40 years time, according to aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
The European giant unveiled its Concept Cabin Tuesday in Paris, ahead of next week's "Le Bourget" Paris Air Show. The cabin is part of its research project entitled "A vision of aviation in 2050."

Airbus says the Concept Cabin is "inspired by nature" and will be 100% recyclable with "self-cleaning materials made from sustainable plant fibres which reduce waste and maintenance and will harvest passenger body heat to power cabin features."
The body of the aircraft has a structure that Airbus says "mimics the efficiency of bird bone which is optimized to provide strength where needed."
A "wall membrane" will enclose the cabin and become transparent to give passengers panoramic views of the sky.
"Our research shows that passengers of 2050 will expect a seamless travel experience while also caring for the environment," said Charles Champion, Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering.
The Concept Cabin also includes seats that adjust to the passengers' body shape.
But the onboard ambience is where airlines will be able to make money. Today's cabin classes have been ripped out and replaced by themed zones.
Airbus envisages a "Vitalizing Zone" for relaxation complete with mood lighting, aromatherapy and acupressure treatments; a "Tech Zone" to stay connected; and in the center of the cabin, an "Interactive Zone," where a round of golf can be played via a virtual projection.
With double-beds, power showers and lounge areas already experienced on Airbus A380 Superjumbos, perhaps passengers with the money will be getting into the zone onboard sooner than Airbus thinks.
