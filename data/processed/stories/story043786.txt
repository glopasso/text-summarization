(PEOPLE.com) -- It looks like Sinead O'Connor is walking away from her 16-day marriage bolder but wiser.
The "Nothing Compares 2 U" singer, 45, announced her split from fourth husband, Barry Herridge, on Monday, 18 days after the two tied the knot in a well-planned December 8 drive-through wedding in Las Vegas. Now, O'Connor tells Britain's Sun tabloid, "I don't think I will even date anyone."
What sabotaged the union? "It felt like I was living in a coffin. It was going to be a coffin for both of us, and I saw him crushed," she says of Herridge, 38. "The whole reason I ended it was out of respect and love for the man."
In addition, O'Connor owns up in the interview that she went on a frantic hunt for cannabis on their wedding night.
"We ended up in a cab in some place that was quite dangerous," O'Connor is quoted as telling the Sun. "I wasn't scared -- but he's a drugs counselor. What was I thinking?"
She adds: "Then I was handed a load of crack. Barry was very frightened -- that kind of messed everything up a bit, really."
