Many food enthusiasts lost their appetite after one of New York City's most exclusive restaurants was served a "C" grade by the Department of Health, but chef Thomas Keller says many of those violations have now been overturned.
The restaurant, Per Se, was slammed by health inspectors after racking up more than 40 violation points during its inspection on February 19. But Keller, who also oversaw the menu at this year's Vanity Fair Oscar party, released a statement Saturday stating a judge had overturned 25 violation points.
Per Se, one of only seven restaurants in New York City to earn three Michelin stars, had an "A" rating before the February inspection and has now gone up from that dreaded "C" to a "B" for falling in the range of 14 to 27 points, according to the updated health report.
Violations listed in the initial health inspection included no hand-washing facility or soap in the food-prep area, hot and cold items held at improper temperatures, eating or drinking in the food-prep area and tobacco use, all of which qualify as "critical" violations, according to the records.
Keller said he still plans to appeal the citation for allegedly cooking potatoes below the recommended temperature. "We will appeal the ruling ... as we are confident that we exemplify the highest culinary standards at Per Se."
