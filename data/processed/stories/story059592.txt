Authorities in Linden, New Jersey, have launched a homicide investigation after the discovery Monday of a pair of trash bags containing the dismembered remains of two people, officials said.
The medical examiner has confirmed the body parts are "indeed human," the Union County Prosecutor's Office said in a news release.
"There were two bodies found inside trash bags near the intersection of Essex Avenue and Cranford Avenue," spokesman John Holl said in the release, adding that the remains are from adults, one male and one female.
Yellow police tape surrounded the scene Monday afternoon, tied to the tree trunks lining the quiet residential street where the black trash bags were discovered earlier in the morning.
Linden Mayor Richard J. Gerbounka, who was at the site, called the shocking discovery "very unusual for this area."
"We've got the homicide investigative team out and they're in the process of culling the area for evidence," he said.
Along with the Linden Police Department, investigators from the county prosecutor's office and the city fire department also were at the site. Officials spread a white sheet around the trash bags before loading the remains onto two stretchers and taking them away for further study.
Autopsies were scheduled for Monday afternoon, according to the prosecutor's office.
