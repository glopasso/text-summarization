ROME, Italy -- Italy national coach Roberto Donadoni has left Cristiano Lucarelli in his squad for next Saturday's crucial Euro 2008 qualifier in Scotland.
Lucarelli keeps his place in the Italian squad after scoring twice against South Africa.
The Shakhtar Donetsk striker is in fine form and has been rewarded for his inspiring performance in last month's friendly against South Africa, when he scored twice in the world champions' victory.
While Donadoni has again left out veteran forwards Filippo Inzaghi and Alessandro Del Piero, he has handed Juventus striker and Italy under-21 international Raffaele Palladino his first call-up to the senior squad.
Donadoni's squad is also boosted by the return from suspension of captain Fabio Cannavaro,
Italy go into the clash in Glasgow third in Group B, two points behind leaders France and one point below Scotland.
Italy end their qualifying campaign by taking on bottom side the Faroe Islands in Modena on November 21.
