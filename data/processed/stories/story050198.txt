Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch showed just why she's the Olympic champion by claiming victory at the women's super-combined event at the World Ski Championships in Austria Friday.
The 28-year-old, who started in fourth position after the opening downhill run, made up the 0.20 second deficit before clocking a fastest time of two minutes 39.92 seconds.
Hoefl-Riesch edged out Slovenia's Tina Maze with home favorite Nicole Hosp pulling off the fastest slalom run to claim bronze, despite finishing a second off the leader.

"I arrived here hoping for a medal, no matter what color," Hoefl-Riesch told reporters.
"I've been lacking confidence this winter. I wasn't favorite coming here and I didn't really feel comfortable in today's slalom.
"Knowing Tina's form, I said to myself, 'Okay, second place is already a very good result'. Now I am extremely happy."
The home support at Schladming had hoped defending world champion Anna Fenninger would shine on the big stage, but the 23-year-old failed to make one gate high up the course.
"I wanted to take risks but it can happen that you straddle a gate," Fenninger told reporters.
"It can also happen if I don't take any risks. Straddling is just a timing problem, it's hard to navigate, and even more so if you don't train slalom often."

Slovenia's Maze, who clinched her second medal and 20th podium of the season following her gold in the Super G, was left frustrated with her performance.
"I held back and showed too much respect," she told reporters.
"My downhill was pretty good though. Second place and a silver medal is still a super result."
