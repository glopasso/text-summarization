A professional BMX rider remained hospitalized Saturday in Las Vegas, Nevada, after he suffered injuries in a horrific crash during a qualifying run, officials said.
Lavin, 33, of Las Vegas, was rushed to University Medical Center after Thursday's accident at the three-day Dew Tour Championship. Video showed Lavin soaring high over a dirt ramp before crashing to the ground.
Lavin was wearing a helmet, tour spokeswoman Nicole Mancuso told CNN.
"T.J. is an important member of the Dew Tour family -- the Tour, athletes and action sports industry are all keeping him in our thoughts and prayers," race officials said in a statement.
Lavin's mother told CNN affiliate KTNV that Lavin broke his eye socket and wrist, and is in a medically-induced coma to reduce swelling on his brain. She said she's confident her son, a veteran of the pro dirt circuit, will pull through.
The competitor remained in critical condition Saturday, hospital spokeswoman Danita Cohen said.
Lavin, the host of MTV's "Real World/Road Rules Challenge" program, has won the gold at several X Games and has produced a music album, according to MTV.
The Dew Tour was established in 2005 and features five events with a combined $2.5 million purse.
Skateboarding and freestyle motocross are featured this weekend, along with the BMX competition.
