A series of jewelry store robberies in Baghdad on Sunday led to clashes with police and left at least seven people dead, according to police in the Iraqi capital.
Among the killed were three store owners and two police officers. Two of the 10 gunmen, who stormed three jewelry stores in western Baghdad's al-Mansour neighborhood, were also killed as they tried to flee the area.
The robbers took gold and cash, and eight remain at large. Iraqi security forces have sealed off the area as they continue to investigate.
The al-Mansour neighborhood, the site of frequent insurgent attacks, and has seen a great deal of violence since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. Authorities believe insurgents are behind some recent robberies to fund their operations.
In May, 14 people died in Baghdad's Bayaa neighborhood where a group of gunmen mounted an 11-store robbery spree.
