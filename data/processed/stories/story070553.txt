Friday marks the debut of the Tech Check podcast from CNN.com.
The weekly podcast offers a roundup of the week's technology news, with members of CNN.com's tech team working to make sense of, and sometimes make light of, the top stories from the digital world.
The breezy, quick-hitting podcast uses a roundtable format to break down the latest from Apple, Google, Facebook and other technology-related newsmakers, with a focus on consumer news.
Topics regularly covered by the Tech Check team include social networking, technology innovation, mobile phones and other gadgets, video gaming and the internet at large.
Features include a User Comment of the Week, culled from reader comments on the website or to the @cnntech Twitter feed, and the Tech Fail of the Week, which pokes fun at a tech company or player that missed the mark.
Tech Check will be hosted most weeks by producer and writer Doug Gross, with a rotating cast of characters that include writer John D. Sutter, associate producer and tech-section contributor Stephanie Goldberg, tech section producer Brandon Griggs and writer Mark Milian, checking in from CNN's San Francisco bureau.
The podcast will be streamed every Friday morning on CNN.com/TECH,  in an RSS feed and on CNN.com's podcast page, and be available on iTunes for free download.
