A nationwide manhunt ended Friday when authorities found the body of a surgeon who had been sought in connection with the deadly shooting of a 33-year-old woman at an upstate New York hospital, police said.
Investigators found Dr. Timothy V. Jorden dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head in a wooded area near his home Friday, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda.
Jorden, a surgeon who had worked at Erie County Medical Center in Buffalo since 2003, was linked to the death of hospital clerk and ex-girlfriend Jacqueline Wisniewski on Wednesday morning, police said.
After piecing together evidence, including surveillance video from Jorden's home and the medical center, police believe that the doctor called Wisniewski Wednesday morning, lured her to a stairwell and shot her five times at close range, Derenda said.
"Had the doctor been alive, he would have been charged with murder today," he added.
Shortly after the shooting, police said surveillance video showed Jorden emptying the shell casings from his gun in his office and proceeding to leave the medical center.
He then returned home, where video showed him leaving through the back door to the woods where his body was found, Derenda said. Federal, state and local investigators had been searching for Jorden since the shooting Wednesday.
Jorden and Wisniewski had broken up after dating for four years, Buffalo Police Chief Patrick Pascall told CNN.
The surgeon graduated from the University of Buffalo School of Medicine in 1996, according to Joe Cirillo, a spokesman for Erie County Medical Center.
After graduating, Jorden served two years of his residency at a military hospital in Tacoma, Washington, before going to Atlanta and then returning to Buffalo to finish his term.
