A father and son in south Texas were charged Thursday with shooting an agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal authorities said.
Pedro Alvarado, 41, and Arnoldo Alvarado, 18, are accused of assault on a federal officer and using a firearm during a crime of violence.
ICE agent Kelton Harrison was shot Tuesday morning near Hargill, Texas, while he and other agents were conducting surveillance relating to an anticipated narcotics deal.
According to a criminal complaint, Harrison was in a parked car when gunshots allegedly were fired from an approaching vehicle. Harrison started driving away and the other car followed and the occupants continued firing at Harrison's vehicle.
The court document said Harrison finally lost control of his car and when other agents arrived on the scene they discovered he'd been shot in back. Harrison survived the shooting but underwent an operation and is still hospitalized.
A search was conducted of a home in Hargill where the two Alvarados were found along with an unidentified minor. According to the court document, the younger Alvarado admitted that he and the minor fired shots at the agent's car while his father drove their vehicle.
Pedro and Arnold Alvarado were arrested and had a court hearing before a magistrate judge Thursday and will remain in jail pending a detention hearing next week. The men requested the judge appoint counsel to represent them.
A Justice Department press release said the minor involved in the case was turned over to state authorities.
"We are encouraged by this action to bring these criminals to justice," said ICE Director John Morton. "We continue to keep the agent and his family in our prayers during his road to recovery."
