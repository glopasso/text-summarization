Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has entered a treatment facility, the team said Tuesday, following his arrest on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.
Irsay was arrested Sunday. He's charged with DWI and four counts of possession of a controlled substance.
"Yesterday, Jim Irsay took the first step toward regaining good health. He voluntarily checked into a highly respected health care facility and is committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help him meet his challenges head-on," the Colts said in a statement.
"Jim, the Irsay family, and the Colts organization are all deeply appreciative of the incredible outpouring of support and compassion from our fans and the Indiana community."
According to police in Carmel, Indiana, officers stopped Irsay at 11:41 p.m. Sunday in Carmel for driving slowly, stopping in a roadway and failing to use his turn signal.
He failed roadside field sobriety tests, and a search of his vehicle found prescription drugs in pill bottles, police said. The drugs reportedly were not associated with any prescription bottles in the vehicle.
