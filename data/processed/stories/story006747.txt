A former high school teacher in Freeland, Michigan, has been arraigned in two counties on 29 counts of sexual misconduct with an underage student, a Midland County prosecutor said Wednesday.
Marcie Rousseau, a 33-year-old married mother of two, is accused of having sex with a then-16-year-old student from May 2009 to February, according to prosecutor Angelina Scarpelli.
There could be two other alleged victims dating back to 2002, Scarpelli told HLN's "Prime News."
Rousseau was placed on administrative leave February 16 while police investigated the allegations. She officially resigned from her teaching job at Freeland High School on June 16, Scarpelli said.
She was arraigned Monday in Saginaw County on 21 counts of criminal sexual conduct, and in Midland County on Tuesday on eight counts of criminal sexual conduct, Scarpelli said.
Rousseau picked the boy up in her car and drove across county lines to have sex with him, Scarpelli said.
Rousseau entered not guilty pleas to the charges this week, Scarpelli said.
Rousseau, who was released on bond Tuesday, is the latest in a spate of recent highly publicized cases of teachers accused of having sex with students.
Broward County, Florida, teacher Kristen Sullivan, 25, was arrested April 20 for allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old student, and Tampa, Florida, teacher Stephanie Ragusa was sentenced Monday to 10 years in prison for sexual relationships with two underage students in 2008.
"We're finally realizing not only that sexual assault exists and how prevalent it is, but there is such a thing as a female perpetrator," Robin Sax, a former prosecutor and author of "Predators and Molesters," told "Prime News."
