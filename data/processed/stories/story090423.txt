One person was killed and two people were injured after gunmen attacked Guinean President Alpha Conde's residence, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
The person killed was a member of the presidential guard, the Ministry of Communications said. The president was not injured.
The attack occurred in downtown Conakry, the capital city of the West African nation early Tuesday morning and the battle lasted two hours.
Authorities believe the attackers may have been soldiers with the Guinean army, said Durus Yale Dore, a government spokesman. Local reports were calling it a failed coup attempt.
Conde has been the president of Guinea for less than a year. His election last year ended a two-year transition to civilian rule after a military junta took power in December 2008.
Journalist Amadou Tam Camara said the attackers were heavily armed and the group had a rocket launcher.
The president's compound was heavily damaged and the attack has surprised many in Guinea, Camara said.
