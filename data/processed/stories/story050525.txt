Amanda Bynes is going to remain under medical care as legal control over her person and estate is temporarily handed to her mother, Lynn.
Bynes, 27, was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold in late July after she was "involved in a disturbance in a residential neighborhood" in Thousand Oaks, California. According to People magazine, the hold was initially for 72 hours, but on July 25, a judge ordered Bynes to be held for an additional two weeks.
At the same time, Bynes' parents, Rick and Lynn, filed for conservatorship of their daughter, who has been exhibiting increasingly bizarre behavior in recent months.
In a hearing Friday, Judge Glen Reiser with the Superior Court of California in Ventura County granted her parents' request for conservatorship, noting that Bynes is under a "continued ... hold in a psychiatric facility."
Bynes' mom, Lynn, now has the ability to decide her daughter's basic needs, including where she should reside. Additionally, People notes, she now has control over her daughter's estimated savings of $3 million, for the time being.
