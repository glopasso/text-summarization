Spain's Jose Manuel Lara claimed only the second European Tour title of his career with victory over Englishman David Lynn in a playoff at the end of the Austrian Open in Atzenbrugg.
The 33-year-old, the winner of the 2007 Hong Kong Open, carded a best-of-the-day eight-under-par 64 to finish on 271 (-17), level with joint overnight leader Lynn -- who posted a 68 for his final 18 holes.
The pair finished three strokes clear of Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round before falling away with a 71, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell (69).
However, on the first extra hole, Lynn needed three shots to find the green and Lara was abe to putt out for a par to seal victory -- and secure his European Tour card for 2011 in the process.
Lara had missed nine cuts in a row before his fourth-place finish at last week's KLM Dutch Open and he carried that form over into this week's event.
"I was expecting something good. I was hitting the ball really well last week," Lara told the official European Tour website after his win.
"I wanted to win this tournament and the way I played this week, in my best dreams, I never imagined that."
Lynn's runner-up performance ensured he kept up an impressive record of finishing inside the top 100 on the Race To Dubai for an 11th consecutive season.
"Second place is a good finish so I can take heart from that and I've played some great golf this week. It's just disappointing it hasn't come off in the end," said the 36-year-old.
