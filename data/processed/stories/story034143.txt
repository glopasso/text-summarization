Whether you're a fan of any sport, or even just a keen music follower -- you've probably visited a major stadium.
The ugliest stadiums in the world? Have a look at our list and tell us what you think of the choices.
Like all buildings with any form of public use, stadiums tend attract more than their fair share of criticism.
It's hard to visit a massive venue that has possibly seen millions of dollars of taxpayer money poured into it, without forming an opinion.
While usability, safety, comfort for players and fans, and the ability to generate a steady income are probably the most important factors for modern-day stadiums, there is one other aspect that is sometimes forgotten: how they look.
We have scanned the world for some of the ugliest stadiums in the world, and we've drawn up a first XI of the less attractive venues.
The stadiums come from all corners of the globe and have been built under all types of budgets. Some of these structures may have been referred to by others as "ugly", they may be facing the threat of being torn down, or we may have just decided that they aren't so easy on the eye.

Some examples that made it into the list include the King Fahd Stadium in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which was built in 1987 and lays claim to having the biggest stadium roof in the world. But sadly does not boast the most attractive structure.
The choice of Wembley Stadium in London, England, may be a controversial one, however, it was named in a list of Britain's ugliest buildings by Britain's The Times newspaper as "a bloated middle-aged office block with a pitch attached."
