As part of an effort to share the best practices of modern business among organizations across the globe, CNN is talking to some of the world's top executives.
In line with this, CNN will be hosting three events looking at modern strategies in today's business arena.
The first of these master classes will be based at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai and will be aired November 10 and 11.
One of the guests at the event will be Howard Schultz, chairman of the international coffee shop chain Starbucks. He will be part of a live discussion at the master class and will take questions that you, the CNN audience, put to him.
As the head of a coffee empire that now boasts over 12,000 stores and recorded revenues in 2006 of $7.8 billion, Schultz is well equipped to tackle questions on the best ways to succeed in today's business world.
The CNN Boardroom Master classes will take place in the homes of the world's largest stock markets -- Shanghai, New York and London. It airs on November10 at 2115 and November 11 at 0115 & 1615 HKT.  E-mail to a friend
