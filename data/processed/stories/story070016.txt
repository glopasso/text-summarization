Defending champion Rafael Nadal has been passed fit to take on American Mardy Fish in the Wimbledon men's singles quarterfinals on Wednesday.
Top seed Nadal was a doubt to face Fish after being troubled with an injury to his left foot during Monday's last 16 win over Juan Martin del Potro.
However, the 25-year-old has now been given the all-clear to play after scans revealed the injury was not serious.
Nadal posted a message to his fans on his Facebook page, saying: "After the match I went to take an MRI at a London hospital.
"During the match I thought I had something serious -- but as the match went on the pain got better and thankfully the tests don't show an injury.
"I will practice today and I will play tomorrow -- thank you all for the support," added the world number one.
Nadal's message is in stark contrast to his mood after defeating del Potro in a hard-fought four-hour marathon played in blistering conditions.
The Spaniard told reporters he came close to retiring hurt during the first set and shook his head repeatedly during a 10-minute injury break while his foot received treatment from the trainer.
After the 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-4 victory, Nadal said: "I felt really bad during the first set. At 6-5 I felt terrible. I felt that I had broken my foot.
"The point at deuce and the point that gave me set point, I just felt terrible. I seriously didn't know at that moment if I had a chance to continue playing."
Nadal has suffered from several injury problems in recent years, notably when a knee problem meant he could not defend his Wimbledon title in 2008.
