(CNN)Andy Murray picked up his first title of 2015 without having to so much as lift his racket after Novak Djokovic pulled out of the Mubadala World Tennis Championship final in Abu Dhabi due to illness.
Djokovic comfortably defeated Stan Wawrinka 6-1 6-2 in Friday's semi-final but was overcome with a fever overnight.
"Unfortunately I am not to be able to play in the final in Abu Dhabi tonight. I've been sick today with a fever and I'm not fit to play," read a message from the World No 1. relayed on the MWTC Facebook page Saturday.
"I said after my match last night, the crowds here have shown their love of tennis again this year and always inspire me to play my best so I am hugely disappointed not to be able to play for them.
"I love being a part of this tournament and I'm really disappointed not be able to take my chance of winning the trophy here again.
"Congratulations to Andy, it's a shame I couldn't play him but I'm sure we will meet again soon.'
Murray later picked up the trophy on court before the third place playoff between Rafael Nadal and Wawrinka.
The Scot had been in fine form himself this week, overcoming Feliciano Lopez on Thursday before trouncing world No. 3 Nadal 6-2 6-0 on Friday.
The result marked the first time Murray had beaten a top-four player since he triumphed in the 2013 Wimbledon final against Djokovic.
A disappointing 2014 saw Murray spend much of the season on the treatment table after back surgery but a late surge saw him climb up the rankings to appear at the season ending ATP Finals in London.
Both Djokovic and Murray will now ramp up their preparations for the year's first major in the shape of the Australian Open which gets underway in a little over two weeks' time.
Djokovic is set to appear in the Qatar Open in Doha next week while Murray will travel to Australia to compete for Great Britain in the Hoffman Cup.
