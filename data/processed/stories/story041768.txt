It's not been an excellent year on television for LGBT characters.
On Friday GLAAD released two of its reports, the seventh annual Network Responsibility Index and the 18th annual Where We Are on TV report, and none of the networks received an excellent rating for having diverse LGBT characters and stories.
ABC, ABC Family, CW, FOX, MTV, NBC and Showtime were rated as "good"; CBS, FX, HBO, TLC, TNT and USA were "adequate"; and History and TBS received "failing" marks.
The ratings in the index were based on LGBT-inclusive content between June 2012 and May 2013, while Where We Are on TV relied on a character count and analysis of scripted characters in the upcoming 2013-2014 season. According to the data, the percentage of primetime broadcast scripted LGBT series regulars dropped to 3.3% from a record high of 4.4% last season. There was diversity, however. The report showed that there will be an equal number of women and men among LGBT characters during the 2013-2014 broadcast season, which means the storylines are moving beyond just featuring white gay males.
"Last season was a stellar one when it comes to the sheer number of gay, lesbian and bisexual representations on television, though diversity within those storylines showed room for improvement," said a statement from GLAAD's Wilson Cruz. "Though the number of LGBT characters dropped this season, shows like 'The Fosters,' with an interracial female couple raising a family, and characters like Unique on 'Glee' have not only moved the conversation about LGBT people forward, but are also a hit with audiences."
Some of the other findings include:
"Our television images not only reach American audiences, but countless others around the world," Cruz said. "It is time for the television networks to make new and groundbreaking LGBT stories a priority once again."
