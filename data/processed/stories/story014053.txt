(EW.com) -- Despite star Kiefer Sutherland's hopes that the "24" movie would begin shooting next month, no amount of Jack Bauer beatdowns can get the seemingly cursed production off the ground, according to TheWrap.
Production on the long-awaited big-screen version of the addictive TV show has been pushed back to 2013.
Sutherland recently told Jay Leno the script (written by "24" scribe Howard Gordon and "The Hunger Games'" Billy Ray) was all systems go, though he admitted scheduling had become the most recent stumbling block. Add budget and Sutherland's salary demands to the mix, and you've got a non-starter.
Or do you?
Gordon told TV Guide that everyone involved was still working to bring Jack Bauer to the big screen. Gordon said that "as recently as a week or two ago... everyone was racing to get [the filming] to happen." He said, "It was kind of a collective decision not to [move forward]," because the script "needed more work."
Said Gordon, "There's no point in doing the movie as an exercise or as a nostalgia piece. We wanted to make it something that can stand on its own." But when will it stand, if at all? That remains to be seen.
