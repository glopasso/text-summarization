A powerful bomb exploded on a passenger bus Tuesday afternoon in Manila's financial district, killing four people and injuring 15 others, police said.
"It's a huge explosion; it's so huge that it created a hole at the side of bus where it is presumed that the bomb was placed,"  said Makati Police Chief Froilan Bonifacio.
Bonifacio said the explosion occurred around 2 p.m.
The bus, owned by Newman Bus Lines, was approaching a Metro Rail Transit station on Buendia Avenue in Makati City, Manila's financial district, when it blew up.
The area has been placed on high alert, according to Makati Mayor Jejomar Binay Jr., who arrived on the scene a short time after the blast. He said most of the victims were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment.
"We are still trying to determine what kind of bomb was used," Bonifacio said.
An initial investigation showed the explosive device could have been placed under a seat on the bus, he said.
