Kate Winslet meant it when she said she was hoping to expand her family.
The "Titanic" actress is expecting her third child and first with husband, Ned Rocknroll, her rep confirmed to CNN.
Winslet, 37, has two children, Mia, 12, and Joe, 9, from her previous marriages to directors Jim Threapleton and Sam Mendes.
"Kate and Ned are delighted," Winslet's rep told People.
In 2006, the actress told InStyle magazine that she hoped to add to her family.
"I don't know whether one or two," she said. "Oh. God, I would love to have more."
Winslet married Rocknroll, the nephew of Virgin Group's Richard Branson, in a private ceremony in December 2012.
