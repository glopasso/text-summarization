Olympian Bruce Jenner and Kris Jenner, the mother of TV's Kardashian clan, have separated after 22 years of marriage, according to the network that airs their reality show.
"We are living separately and we are much happier this way," E! News quoted the former couple as saying in a joint statement Tuesday.  "But we will always have much love and respect for each other. Even though we are separated, we will always remain best friends and, as always, our family will remain our No. 1 priority."
The couple have two daughters -- Kendall and Kylie -- together.  Kris Jenner, 57, is also mother to Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob Kardashian from her marriage to the late lawyer Robert Kardashian.
Bruce Jenner, 63, won an Olympic gold medal in the decathlon in 1976.
Representatives for the couple did not immediately respond to CNN's request for confirmation or comment.
