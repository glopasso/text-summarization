Why style matters
If we live in a particular way, we want the same when we travel; and the airline and hotel industry are more in tune with what we want than ever before. We look at why style matters on the road and in the air.
Attire to suit every occasion
We get some golden rules from Hollywood stylist Negar Ali who shows Richard Quest how to co-ordinate and downsize his wardrobe, and a secret weapon - equivalent to the 'little black dress'.
