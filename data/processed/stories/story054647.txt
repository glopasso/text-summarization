A man who grew angry during a homeowners meeting at a German bar shot and killed two men and wounded five others Tuesday before turning the gun on himself, police said.
The meeting was at a bar in Dossenheim, a small town just north of Heidelberg in southern Germany.
At some point the participants began to argue and one of them left the room, police said. That man came back and opened fire on the others with a pistol, killing two of them and seriously wounding five.
The suspect then shot and killed himself, police said.
The wounded were taken to local hospitals and the others were given counseling.
