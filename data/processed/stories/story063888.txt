More than a thousand stranded people, cold and fearful, escaped blankets of snow and slippery roads Saturday after the Indian air force ferried them to warmer climates.
In all,1,100 people on the sole highway linking the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir's winter and summer capitals -- Srinagar and Jammu -- were airlifted out of misery.
People had been waiting for days for the treacherous highway to reopen after unusually heavy snowfall caused avalanches in the northern, mountainous Kashmir region. The road re-opened briefly three days ago but authorities allowed only big trucks carrying essential goods.
Uncertainty set in as the highway remained unnavigable by most of vehicles. State authorities finally were forced to seek Indian military help.
The highway has been closed 11 days in January.
In some places, the snow has piled up several feet. More of the white stuff is forecast for Sunday.
