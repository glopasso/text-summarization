Newcastle United has fined their manager Alan Pardew £100,000 ($168,000) for head-butting an opposition player during an English Premier League match on Saturday.
The 52-year-old clashed with Hull City midfielder David Meyler during Newcastle's 4-1 win at the KC Stadium.
The incident happened in the 72nd minute as Meyler was retrieving a ball for a throw in. Pardew was sent to the stands by the referee and later apologized.
"I apologize to everyone. I should not have got involved in it," Pardew said.
In a statement published on the club's official website, Saturday, Newcastle said that Pardew's actions were "disappointing" and "unacceptable" and took away from a positive performance on the pitch.
"Alan unreservedly apologized immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United," the NUFC statement said.
"We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behavior today and also a Club fine of £100,000."
Pardew, who has been manager of Newcastle since December 2010, will also be investigated by the English Football Association about the incident.
