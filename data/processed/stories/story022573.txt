In one of the most memorable status updates we've seen in a while, a Taiwanese tourist in Melbourne, Australia, was so absorbed in Facebook that she walked off the end of St. Kilda pier and plunged into the chilly waters of Port Phillip Bay.
Called to the scene by a quick-thinking witness, police arrived to find "the distressed woman, floundering in the water."
Police rescued the woman who, in addition to not being able to watch where she was going, reportedly couldn't swim.
Police say the woman in her mid 30s was in the water for about 20 minutes.
"There will be no need for a lost property report as the woman kept hold of her mobile phone throughout the entire ordeal," said a Victoria Police media officer.
