(CNN)The fallout at Sigma Alpha Epsilon continues.
Just days after a video surfaced of frat members singing a racist song, another video is making the rounds. This one appears to show the fraternity's house mom laughing and saying the n-word.
Two students expelled over racist chant
The Oklahoma Daily, the university's student newspaper, posted a Vine dating from 2013 that shows an older woman talking over a rap song, saying "ni****" seven times in quick succession.
The woman, who is seated with an Oklahoma shirt behind her, laughs before repeating the racial epithet. The sound of "All Gold Everything" from Trinidad James -- a black, Atlanta-based rapper -- can be heard in the background.
Black OU SAE alumnus: 'They are not my brothers'
The student newspaper reports that the woman appears to be Beauton Gilbow, who was the SAE chapter's house mom. She responded in a statement Tuesday.
"I have been made aware that a video of me that is circulating on social media and in the news. I am heartbroken by the portrayal that I am in some way racist. I have friends of all race and do not tolerate any form of discrimination in my life.
"I was singing along to a Trinidad song, but completely understand how the video must appear in the context of the events that occurred this week," said Gilbow.
Before the Vine came out but after the fraternity chapter was suspended, the woman known as "Momma B" told CNN affiliate KOCO-TV that she was blindsided by the overall controversy.
"I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me," Gilbow said. "This has been my life for 15 years. And it's tough."
