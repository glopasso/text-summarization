Two 16-year-old Palestinian boys were killed and three other teens were injured in Gaza on Friday from an unexploded Israeli ordnance, Palestinian medical and security officials said.
Hamas security sources say the explosive device was left over from Israel's 22-day Gaza offensive that began two years ago. There was no immediate Israeli response to this incident.
The Palestinian sources also reported the wounding of two people in Gaza, one a worker collecting gravel near the Erez Crossing and another a farmer east of Khan Younis.
An Israel Defense Forces spokesman said Israeli forces fired shots when suspicious people approached the fence between Gaza and Israel in two separate locations. One incident occurred in northern Gaza and the other took place near Khan Younis.
Troops first fired warning shots in the air but the people continued moving. Then, they fired at their legs, the IDF said.
