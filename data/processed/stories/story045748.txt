Angolan authorities have seized a U.S.-flagged ship in the port of Lobito, a spokesman for the Maersk Line of shipping containers said Wednesday. Local authorities said the ship was laden with war materials.
"Maersk Constellation has been detained by Angolan authorities in order to verify proper documentation of hazardous cargo," Maersk spokesman Kevin Speers said in a written statement.
"The cargo in question is a U.S. government-approved export that is moving in full conformance with U.S. and international law. The cargo is not destined for Angola. We are working with Angolan and U.S. government officials and expect a resolution that will allow the ship to continue its voyage."
Local police authorities said that the vessel, en route from Senegal to Kenya, was seized Monday when it docked in Lobito, said Journalist Jose Manuel Alberto.
According to the ship's manifest, it was carrying soy for a South African non-governmental organization working in Benguela, a city in western Angola, but authorities said they discovered that the soy in four of the containers was covering a cache of guns, ammunition and rockets.
Local police said the captain had known of the munitions, which belong to Kenya's Defense Ministry, but failed to declare them.
A call to Maersk was not immediately returned.
A U.S. Embassy statement said the seizure was related to customs questions.
