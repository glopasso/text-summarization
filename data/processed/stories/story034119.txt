So Eva Mendes was pregnant after all.
On Friday, the actress and partner Ryan Gosling welcomed a baby girl into the world, according to Us Weekly. The couple had kept the gestation under wraps, even though rumors of it had been percolating through magazines and the tabloid press since July.
Ryan Gosling and Eva Mendes: Oh baby
Mendes even told Ellen DeGeneres in February -- when she likely would have been several weeks along -- that the rumors were "ridiculous."
"It all started because I didn't want to go through the scanners at the airport," she said then, adding that she always opts out of that form of security check.
The two are far from the first celebrities to try to keep their private lives -- and baby bumps, as the supermarket press likes to call them -- private. Emily Blunt had a quiet wedding with John Krasinski. Matt Damon and Luciana Barroso (who was called a "normal" by Crushable.com) have kept their family away from the media.
How Mendes and Gosling will do with a child in the media spotlight is anybody's guess, but the two have experience at maintaining their privacy. After all, they've been together for three years now, since meeting on 2011's "The Place Beyond the Pines."
