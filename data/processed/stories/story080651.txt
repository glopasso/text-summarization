Nickelodeon star Miranda Cosgrove suffered a broken ankle when her tour bus wrecked on an Illinois highway Thursday morning, her representative said.
Five passengers were on the bus when it crashed on Interstate 70, just outside of Vandalia, Illinois, the rep said in a statement to CNN.
"At this time, we are told everyone will be fine," the rep said. "Because of this, her tour is postponed until further notice."
Cosgrove, 18, has been touring to promote her music, but she is well known for her acting. She's the star of Nickelodeon's hit TV show "iCarly."
