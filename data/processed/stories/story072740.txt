Edgar Davids made a successful return to playing action after a two-year absence by leading minnows Barnet to its first league win of the season.
Barnet, which plays in League Two in England, had failed to win any of its previous 12 league games and was beaten 4-1 in Davids' first match in charge last weekend.
The 39-year-old was appointed as joint Head Coach of the strugglers last week alongside Mark Robson, who arrived at Underhill at the start of the season.
'Pitbull' Davids joins Barnet
And after installing himself as captain and picking up his trademark booking, Davids helped Barnet to an impressive 4-0 win over Northampton Town.
Davids, who had been coaching street soccer in London, had not played competitively since appearing for Crystal Palace back in October 2010.
But his presence boosted a Barnet side, which started the night rooted to the foot of the league table and contemplating a fight against relegation.
The Dutchman, who has won league titles in Italy and the Netherlands, also lifted the Champions League trophy during his earlier days with Ajax.
Nicknamed 'Pitbull' it was the tenacious nature of Davids' play which endeared him to the public and helped him win 74 international caps for the Netherlands between 1994 and 2005.
While Davids has been used to gracing the San Siro and Camp Nou, he was forced to encounter the infamous Underhill slope for the very first time.
But even that failed to stop him as he lasted the full 90 minutes in what was a perfect return to professional football.
