(CNN)  -- Double-amputee athlete Oscar Pistorius was selected Monday in the South African team for the world championships in Daegu later this month.
Pistorius will run in the individual 400m and is part of the 4x400m relay for the biennial competition in South Korea from August 27-September 4.
Pistorius, nicknamed 'The Blade Runner' , will be competing in a global championships, fulfilling a lifelong ambition.
"I have dreamt for such a long time of competing in a major championship and this is a very proud moment in my life," he said in a statement.
The 24-year-old Pistorius was cleared to compete against able-bodied athletes three years ago, but in the past has failed to reach the qualifying times for the Olympics and major championships.
But all that changed with a 45.07 second clocking for 400m in Italy last month.
"The IAAF is a world-class governing body for our sport and I am grateful to have the chance to run in their events. It will be a great day for me when I set out on the track in Daegu and hope to do my country proud," he added.
The four-time Paralympic gold medallist had both legs amputated below the knee for medical reasons when he was 11 months old, but it has not prevented him competing in a number of sports, including athletics.
Reigning world 800m champion Caster Semenya will get the chance to defend her title after also being named in the South African squad.
Semenya became embroiled in a major row over her gender after winning the title in Berlin in 2009 but has returned to the circuit this season with mixed success.
