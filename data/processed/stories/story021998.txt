(CNN)Each day, we're transported to a beautiful place somewhere in the world and it's all thanks to you.
This virtual vacation comes about each morning, when CNN producers select a user-submitted photo to be our Travel Photo of the Day. This year, we visited Angkor Wat in Cambodia and the Danakil Depression in Ethiopia.
2014 was bursting with gorgeous travel photography. We've selected 25 standout images from the series as a thank you to our community. Click through the gallery above to see our choices, and tell us your favorite in the comments below.
