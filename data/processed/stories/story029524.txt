Bayer Leverkusen moved within eight points of German Bundesliga leaders Borussia Dortmund after a 2-0 victory over Hannover.
First half goals from Arturo Vidal and Simon Rolfes settled the outcome and saw Leverkusen go five points clear of Hannover who sit third.
But Dortmund can extend the gap at the top to 11 points if they win at Wolfsburg on Saturday.
The home side nearly fell behind inside two minutes when Norwegian striker Mohamed Abdellaoui was denied by Leverkusen keeper Rene Adler.
But after that early scare Leverkusen took control of the match and Vidal put them in front on 21 minutes.
The Chilean midfielder  pounced on a loose ball on the edge of the penalty area after Hannover failed to clear from Stefan Kiessling's blocked shot and his volley flew into the net.
German international and former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack should have doubled Leverkusen's advantage moments later but he headed wide of the target.
Adler was called upon to preserve the home side's lead after a rare breakaway from Hannover as Lars Stindi capitalized on former Liverpool defender Sami Hyypia's mistake but his shot was right at the keeper.
But just before the interval Rolfes made it 2-0. He collected Gonzalo Castro's pass and curled his effort into the net.
Hannover piled on the pressure in the second half but couldn't cut the deficit.
