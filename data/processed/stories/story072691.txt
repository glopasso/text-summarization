A weekend robbery in a racially diverse neighborhood of Washington may have been a hate crime, police said.
"This is for Trayvon Martin," one of the three black men told a white man as they approached him early Saturday, according to Washington Metropolitan Police Officer Anthony Clay.
The alleged robbery happened two weeks after a Florida jury acquitted George Zimmerman in the 2012 death of African-American teenager Trayvon Martin.

The men kicked the adult white male as they took his iPhone and wallet, Clay said Sunday.
The man, who has not been publicly identified, suffered minor injuries and refused medical treatment, he said.
There have been no arrests, but police are investigating the incident as a hate crime, he said.
It happened in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in the northwest quadrant of the nation's capital.
