A heat wave of historic proportions could strike some Northeastern states as forecasters warn of prolonged triple-digit temperatures that could trigger "a dangerous situation," the National Weather Service advised Monday.
The Weather Service has issued an excessive heat advisory for several Northeastern cities to take effect Monday afternoon as humidity levels gradually increase, producing heat index values to persist and surpass 100 degrees.
Excessive heat advisories have been issued for the Philadelphia metropolitan area until Wednesday evening, and in New York City, a heat advisory is in effect from to 2 p.m. Monday until 6 p.m. Tuesday as high humidity levels and high temperatures linger for two consecutive days, the Weather Service reported.
The increase in humidity, matched by weather patterns, may force the Weather Service to issue additional heat advisories for central New Jersey, northeastern Maryland and central and southern Delaware.
The Weather Service advised people affected by the heat to "drink plenty of fluids," stay out of the sun and in air-conditioned rooms, and to check up on relatives and neighbors.

Tuesday is expected to be the hottest day of the stretch, with highs ranging from 100 to 102 degrees and heat index values up to 106, the Weather Service warned.
