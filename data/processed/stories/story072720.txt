It is a well known fact in golf -- nobody who wins the Par 3 contest at Augusta goes on to win the Masters in the same week.
Ryan Moore will be the latest man who trying to avoid the curse after carding a six-under 21 to win the competition Wednesday.
U.S. star Moore, whose best finish at Augusta came in 2005 in 13th, finished two shots clear at the top of the leaderboard.
"I'm not afraid of it," he told reporters after being asked about the curse.
"You never know, someone has got to break that curse at some point in time, so hopefully it's me.
"It was fun having my boy out there and playing a round with a couple of friends. That's what it's for, to kind of make you relax a little bit and just go and enjoy yourself the afternoon before."
The idea for the Par 3 Contest was the brainchild of Clifford Roberts, a former chairman and co-founder of Augusta.
Sam Snead won the first competition in 1960 and it has since become an integral part of the lead up to the Masters.
Players invited their wives, girlfriends, mothers and children to caddy for them Wednesday as traditions were maintained.
Rory McIlroy, who is one of the favorites for the title, allowed tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki to carry his bags for the day.
Elsewhere, several babies were seen on greens as crowds flocked to see Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Arnold Palmer in action.
The real action begins Thursday at 7.45am local time with Stuart Cink of the U.S. getting proceedings underway alongside South Africa's Tim Clark.
Defending champion Adam Scott goes out in the 16th group with Jason Dufner and English amateur Matthew Fitzpatrick.
McIlroy, who is aiming for a third major, goes out next with Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed.
