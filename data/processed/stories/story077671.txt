Vincent Kompany has signed a new six-year contract with Manchester City -- the longest contract offered to a player in the club's history.
It is unusual for players to be offered more than five years for a contract, but the 26-year-old Belgian has been a key figure for City and captained the club to their first league title in 44 years last season.
"For me if you are good somewhere then there is no reason to look elsewhere. Man City as a project is not just a project of the owners or the people employed by the club; it is also my project," Kompany told the club's website.
"I have been here since the beginning and I have seen everything at the club change inside and out," added Kompany, who joined the club in 2008 from Hamburg SV for $9.25m.
"It is good to know that I can be at City for another six years. It is a compliment that the club feels so highly of me."

The Belgian international, who was captain when City won the FA Cup in 2011, was selected in the Professional Footballers' Association Team of the Year last season, alongside teammates David Silva, Joe Hart and Yaya Toure.
"Our title win was amazing and one of the best feelings ever for us and the fans," said Kompany, reflecting on City's Premier League triumph, that was only confirmed in stoppage-time after Sergio Aguero's winner in the 3-2 victory against QPR.
"That last game against QPR will be a very special part of City's history for the next 50 or 100 years but now is the time to look forward."
"We have laid the foundations and now we want to win more. If we do that then we can be one of the most successful clubs for a long time to come and that is the aim."
