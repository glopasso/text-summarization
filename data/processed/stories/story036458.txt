NBC is reportedly considering a TV series follow-up to Cameron Crowe's 1989 classic "Say Anything," but both Crowe and star John Cusack are vocally against the idea.
On Monday, Deadline reported that NBC had a script commitment in place for a single-camera comedy based on Crowe's landmark coming-of-age story. In the movie, Cusack played mediocre student Lloyd Dobler, who was smitten with the high school valedictorian, Diane Court (Ione Skye).
NBC's potential show would be set 10 years after the events of the movie, picking up in the aftermath of a breakup as Lloyd tries to win Diane back.
The movie was both written and directed by Crowe. The TV series would be tackled by "Better Off Ted" producer Justin Adler.
Crowe, meanwhile, has made it known he's not at all on board.
"Regarding the announcement of a 'Say Anything' tv show... @JohnCusack, @IoneSkye1 and I have no involvement... except in trying to stop it," Crowe tweeted Monday night.
Cusack was just as disturbed by the news of a TV series, tweeting that he knew Crowe would be "repulsed at this horror."
"No end to the exploitation of other people's sincere efforts in shameless slime," the actor said on Twitter. "(T)errible idea - they never want the creators only to make money off it themselves."
This isn't the first time NBC has tried to create a new concept from a beloved movie. Last summer, the network was eyeing a comedy based on 1994's "Reality Bites."
