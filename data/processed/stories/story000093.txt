Istanbul (CNN)A woman carried out a suicide bombing at a police station in Istanbul's historic Sultanahmet district Tuesday evening, killing one police officer and injuring another, officials said.
The attack happened in the section of Turkey's largest city that is home to landmarks such as the Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque, and is heavily trafficked by tourists.
The bomber, speaking English, entered the police station saying she lost her wallet, and the explosion happened at about 5:20 p.m., Istanbul Gov. Vasip Sahin told reporters. Sahin did not mention a motive for the attack.
Sahin initially said that the blast, besides killing the bomber, critically injured one police officer and slightly wounded another. Later Tuesday, Turkey's semi-official Anadolu news agency reported that one of the officers died of his wounds at a hospital.
Police cordoned off the area. The attacker's identity is unknown and the incident is being investigated, the governor told reporters.
