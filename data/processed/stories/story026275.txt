It's been one year since Fort Bragg soldier Kelli Bordeaux went missing, and there's now a reward being offered for information that could help authorities solve the mystery, according to police in Fayetteville, North Carolina.
The military is offering $25,000 for information that could help explain what happened to Pfc. Bordeaux, Detective Jeff Locklear told CNN on Monday.
Last April, police and the military searched an area near a Fayetteville bar where Bordeaux was last seen and last used her cell phone, authorities then told CNN.

The 23-year-old soldier left the Froggy Bottoms bar early on a Saturday, police told CNN then. She had been drinking and was given a ride home by a bar employee, according to a U.S. Army official who spoke on condition of anonymity at the time of that story.
At some point, the Army official said, Bordeaux sent two text messages.
One said, "got home safely."
The official did not know who the text was sent to or the contents of the second text message.
Last April, Fayetteville Police Chief Tom Bergamine said that Bordeaux was described as a "very good soldier, not the type of person that would come up AWOL or missing."
The Army official told CNN that police searched Bordeaux's apartment and vehicle, but the official did not know where the vehicle was found. Bordeaux was reported missing on April 16 of last year when she failed to report for duty, the official said.
Bordeaux's older sister, Olivia Cox, told reporters last April that it was out of character for her to miss work.
Bordeaux's mother, Johnna Henson, said she had been told by police that an individual gave her daughter a ride to the bar, where Bordeaux sang karaoke.
