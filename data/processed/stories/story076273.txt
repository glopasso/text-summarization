The golf community is rallying around Jason Day after it emerged the Australian lost eight members of his family during the devastation wreaked by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines.
Day, whose mother moved from the Philippines to Australia over 30 years ago, is reported to have lost his grandmother, his uncle and six cousins during the typhoon, which has so far claimed 3,976 lives according to authorities.
"I am deeply saddened to confirm that multiple members of my family lost their lives as the victims of Typhoon Haiyan," said the world No. 18 in a statement released by the PGA Tour.
"My family and I are thankful for all who have reached out with their prayers and concern. We feel devastated for all who have been affected by this horrific tragedy."
The typhoon struck earlier this month, with 1,598 still unaccounted for across the Philippines.
"While I understand the media's interest in this matter and hope that any coverage can spread awareness to assist with the relief efforts that continue in the Philippines, I hope that all will respect my family's privacy during this difficult time," added Day.
"I will have no further public comments at this time. Please pray for all who have suffered loss. Thank you."
Day is scheduled to play in the World Cup of Golf alongside compatriot Adam Scott, an event which gets underway on Thursday in Melbourne.
The duo were practicing at the Royal Melbourne course on Monday and the 26-year old is due to hold a press conference alongside world No. 2 Scott on Wednesday.
Day's mother, Denning, migrated from the Philippines to Australia 30 years ago, with a PGA Tour article reporting she had family in the city of Tacloban, capital of the ravaged Leyte province.
