Lewis Hamilton is banking on a "highly motivated" Mercedes team to deliver him a second F1 world title after his big money switch from McLaren.
The 28-year-old Hamilton will partner Germany's Nico Rosberg for the upcoming 2013 season, a pairing described by team principal Ross Brawn as "the strongest driver line-up in Formula One."
But both Hamilton and Rosberg will be hoping the new Mercedes F1 W04 -- unveiled Monday in Jerez in Spain ahead of pre-season testing -- will be competitive.
Hamilton, the 2008 world champion with McLaren, has no doubts that he will achieve his goals.
"I have never seen a group of people that is hungrier for success than this one," he told the official F1 website.
"I can't wait to drive it and see where I can make a difference to help push the team forward with Nico (Rosberg)."

Rosberg has also been impressed by the hunger for success at Mercedes after a lackluster 2012 season.
"The atmosphere in the team is positive and the team are highly motivated to succeed," he said.
"I have a new teammate with Lewis and and looking forward to working together and pushing each other hard."
The F1 W04 sports a redesigned front wing and exhaust package and Brawn claimed it was a "clear step forward in design and detail sophistication over its predecessor."
After four days testing at the Andalusian circuit, the first competitive outing will come at the Australian Grand Prix on March 17.
Hamilton replaced seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher at the "Silver Arrow" team after the German legend retired for the second time at the end of last season.
