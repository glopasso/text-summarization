A man who claims he is the father of a baby found in a South Carolina toilet said he doubts the explanations about why the recently arrested mother left the newborn in a commode.
Jessica Blackham was arrested and charged in connection with the discovery of her newborn son in the toilet of a South Carolina arena, Greenville Police Chief Terri Wilfong said.
In a recent court hearing, Blackham's parents said they did not know that she was pregnant and it was implied that Blackham may not have known that she was pregnant. Blackham told police that she cannot remember what happened after she went into the bathroom at the arena when she was attending a circus.
Jason Jones, who said he dated Blackham, told HLN's Nancy Grace that he doubted that story.
"As far as being her not knowing she was pregnant, that's a bunch of bull crap," Jones told Grace Wednesday. "She wrote on her Facebook that she was at one time having morning sickness and a bunch of headaches, and I commented and asked her was she pregnant, and she told me not to worry about it. That she would take care of it."
A custodian discovered the infant, thought then just to be around an hour old, late Friday at Greenville's BI-LO Center.
The baby was rushed to the hospital and police searched for the mother for days making public appeals and sifting through videotape taken in and around the restroom.
Wilfong said Wednesday that the baby was making progress at the hospital.
"He's doing well. He's in stable condition, and we're very thankful for that. And each day, he's getting better," Wilfong said.
Blackham was charged with felony child abuse and unlawful neglect, CNN affiliate WYFF reported. She was released on bond after the court hearing, the affiliate reported.
No one has been named as the father of the child, but Jones said he has contacted police and wants to take a DNA test.
