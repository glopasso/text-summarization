Sen. John McCain, who has held onto his Senate seat for 30 years, seems hesitant to let it go in the next 2016 election.
The Arizona senator, who will be 80 years old that year, told reporters on Thursday that he is "strongly considering" and "leaning towards" another reelection bid.
"We were talking to our longtime supporters -- many of whom have been with us for many years and we're grateful for their support -- about the options, and what we see as the future of the party in Washington and here in Arizona," McCain said after an event at the Ritz-Carlton in Phoenix, according to the Arizona Republic.
"We're getting a lot of their input as to whether I should run for re-election or not. They know that I am seriously considering it, and leaning towards it."
While his supporters think he has enough steam for another term, McCain said it would be "a very, very tough campaign." He has been heavily criticized by conservatives for sticking closer to the center than with them. The Arizona Republic reports that the state's Republican Party targeted McCain earlier this year for "being too liberal," especially with immigration reform.
If he decides to throw his hat in the ring, McCain knows the campaign trail will be bumpy.
"Oh, I think you can certainly anticipate it," McCain said. "If you're going to win a campaign, you have to plan for all scenarios, including significant primary opposition. I wouldn't like to see it, obviously. Unfortunately, we don't conduct campaigns by unanimous consent."
With a tough primary potentially ahead of him, McCain said he will announce his decision in early 2015.
"We've got to get going early next year," he said. "We have to prepare, as we always do. Every campaign I've been in, I've said, 'Look, this is going to be the toughest.' You have to assume that. We've seen, historically, that people who take anything for granted, then they put that election in jeopardy. I've never done that."
