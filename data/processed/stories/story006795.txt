(EW.com) -- Nostalgia has been digitized.
In "Wreck-It Ralph's" byte-size universe of arcade games, a pixelated panoply of characters (both copyrighted and made-up) commingle each day after the final quarter has been dropped. But for Ralph, the bulldozer-handed villain of the 1980s arcade relic Fix-It Felix Jr., life isn't all power-ups and extra lives.
An 8-bit brute with a heart of gold, Ralph (voiced with hangdog perfection by John C. Reilly) escapes his game on a quest to prove to the world that there's more to him than just being bad. As the well-meaning Fix-It Felix Jr. (Jack McBrayer) and a rough-and-tumble space soldier (Jane Lynch) pursue him, Ralph ends up in "Sugar Rush," a racing game set in a confectionary wonderland of cotton-candy clouds, peppermint forests, and innumerable dessert puns of varying tastiness.

The story itself risks getting overly sweet at this point, but miraculously it never melts into a syrupy wash. There are more videogame cameos and winks than you can shake a Wiimote at â€” even the Konami Code, the gamer's paternoster, makes an appearance â€” but the real success of the film is its emotional core and the relationship between the two misfits.
It doesn't quite carry the heft of "Toy Story," but there's a lot of heart packed into these zeroes and ones. B+
