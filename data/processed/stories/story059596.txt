A North Korean torpedo attack was the most likely cause for the sinking of a South Korean warship last month, according to a US military official.
The US believes the ship was sunk by the blast of an underwater explosion, but that the explosive device itself did not come in contact with the hull of the South Korean ship, the official said.
This is the same conclusion expressed by South Korean military officials.
