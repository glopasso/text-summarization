Neiman Marcus says it may be the latest retailer to be struck by hackers.
The upscale store says it was informed in mid-December of a possible breach.
"On January 1, the forensics firm discovered evidence that the company was the victim of a criminal cyber-security intrusion and that some customers' cards were possibly compromised as a result," Neiman Marcus said in a statement.
"We have begun to contain the intrusion and have taken significant steps to further enhance information security."
This comes on the heels of a massive credit and debit card data breach at Target that could affect as many as 70 million people.
It is too early to tell how many customers were affected, said Ginger Reeder, a spokeswoman for Neiman Marcus stores.
Neiman Marcus says it has informed federal law enforcement agencies and is working actively with the U.S. Secret Service.
