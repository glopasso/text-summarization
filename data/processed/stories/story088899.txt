Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant and his wife, Vanessa, say they are calling off their divorce.
And they announced it on social media.
On Friday, Vanessa Bryant's Instagram page had a message reading: "We are pleased to announce that we have reconciled. Our divorce action will be dismissed. We are looking forward to our future together."
Kobe Bryant posted a message on his Facebook page the same day.
"I am happy to say that Vanessa and I are moving on with our lives together as a family," he posted. "When the show ends and the music stops, the journey is made beautiful by having that someone to share it with. Thank you all for your support and prayers."
Vanessa Bryant filed for divorce in December 2011, citing irreconcilable differences.
The divorce filing came nearly 10 years after she famously stuck by him after he admitted to having sex with a woman at a Colorado hotel.
Their marriage was thrust into the spotlight when the desk clerk at a Vail-area resort hotel told police that Kobe Bryant had sexually assaulted her in 2003.
The Eagle County District Attorney filed charges against Bryant shortly after the accusation. At the time, Vanessa Bryant sat by her husband's side as he publicly apologized to her while admitting that he'd had consensual sex with the 19-year-old.
Turning to his wife, Bryant said, "You're a piece of my heart. You're the air I breathe. And you're the strongest person I know. And I'm so sorry for having to put you through this, for having to put our family through this."
Criminal charges against Bryant were later dismissed. He settled a federal lawsuit with his accuser in 2005.
The couple have two daughters together.
