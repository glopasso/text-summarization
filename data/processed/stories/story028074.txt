Thirty-four vehicles, including four semi-trailer trucks, were involved in a chain-reaction pile-up Monday morning in Colorado that temporarily shut down a major highway and sent 12 people to area hospitals, state police said.
The massive accident occurred on Interstate 25 northbound in Larkspur, about 40 miles south of Denver and 30 miles north of Colorado Springs, Colorado, State Patrol Trooper Nate Reid told CNN.
None of the injuries appeared to be life-threatening, according to Reid. He added that road conditions were icy and wet at the time of the accident.
Motorist Brad Simpson told CNN affiliate KOAA, "It was just really bad snow, it was something where a lot of people were driving way too fast for the conditions."
Authorities used school buses to move people who were not injured but were stuck on the highway. They were taken to a shelter at the New Covenant Church in Larkspur, authorities told CNN affiliate KUSA.
The accident prompted police to close the highway northbound. Several CNN affiliates, including KMGH and KWGN, reported that one lane reopened around noon and traffic was moving through all lanes by 12:45 p.m. -- about four hours after the accident happened.
