(EW.com) -- Didn't get a chance to read "Girls" creator Lena Dunham's $3.7 million book proposal when it leaked online last Friday? Too bad -- Gawker, the site that originally published the proposal, has removed it after being contacted by Charles Harder, the 26-year-old multihyphenate's lawyer.
Buzzfeed has taken down every image from a post titled "9 Passages From Lena Dunham's Book Proposal Illustrated By Her Instagrams" as well.
But while Gawker writer John Cook got rid of the proposal itself -- though it's probably still floating around on the Internet, since Cook posted it as a downloadable Scribd file -- he neglected to scrub several of its quotes from his original blog post despite Harder's cease and desist.

Instead, Cook has added snide commentary meant "to clarify our intent in quoting the above matter from Dunham's proposal" to each excerpt.
Example: "The quoted sentence demonstrates that Dunham is incapable of conceiving a rationale for writing that doesn't serve the goal of drawing attention to herself."
"Girls" returns to HBO January 13.
