Two people were killed and more than 50 others injured Thursday in a 40-car pileup that shut down Interstate 10 in eastern New Orleans, authorities said.
Both eastbound and westbound lanes were closed following the crashes, which began about 4 a.m. local time (5 a.m. ET), said Garry Flot, New Orleans police spokesman. It was unknown how long the interstate would be closed, he said.
Twenty-two people were transported to hospitals with minor to critical injuries. Another 37 complained of minor injuries at the scene but refused medical care, Flot said.
One firefighter suffered a cut on his face while performing his duties at the scene, Flot said. He was taken to a local hospital for stitches.
The area was experiencing heavy fog at the time the crashes occurred, according to CNN meteorologists.
