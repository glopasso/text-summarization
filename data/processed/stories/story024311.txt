Pirates in the Indian Ocean attacked and boarded an Italian flagged and owned oil tanker on Tuesday, the European Union Naval Force Somalia said.
The incident occurred 670 nautical miles east of Yemen's Socotra Island.
The MV Savina Caylyn was headed from Sudan to Malaysia when five people on a skiff launched a "sustained attack" on the tanker with small arms and rocket propelled grenades and then got on the ship.
At present, there is no communication with the vessel and no information on the status of the 22-person crew, which includes 17 Indians and five Italians.
