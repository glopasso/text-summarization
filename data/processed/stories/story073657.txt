Bangs may be a modern red carpet staple, but they actually have a long history (hair-story?) in Hollywood. Whether wispy or thick, feathered or blunt-cut, bangs are the go-to hair choice for celebs who need a new coif. Here, we look back at the evolution of the A-list fringe.
Louise Brooks, 1925
There's nothing quiet about this silent movie starlet's looks, right down to her "Dutch Boy" bob cut. Her thick thatch of bangs, cut straight across the forehead, became a popular look with flappers seeking to defy society's vision of beauty.
Veronica Lake, 1942
Lake's side-parted style, which tumbled like a curtain over her right eye, became known as the "peek-a-boo bang," and was even parodied by Lake herself in the movie Star Spangled Rhythm. Later, Kim Basinger's L.A. Confidential style was modeled on the look.

Peggy Moffitt, 1965
Vidal Sassoon clipped this mod model's thick black hairâ€”fringe and allâ€”creating one of the most famous haircuts of the '60s and making Sassoon a household name.
Jean Shrimpton, 1965
The English model wore her fringe finely trimmed, and often tucked the wisps behind her ears (a trick later used by Alexa Chung).
Jane Fonda, 1970

Loni Anderson, 1980
She's not a natural blonde, but the WKRP in Cincinnati star's flaxen coif helped steer her career, and her halo of big bangs helped define a decade where excess was everything.
Sarah Jessica Parker, 1985
Though the most popular bang style of the '80s required a gallon of Aquanet and just as much heat, some girls just wanna have fun with less product, like this wispy fringe sported by a pre-Bradshaw SJP.
Christina Applegate, 1987
As ditzy Kelly Bundy on Married...With Children, Applegate wore her bangs sky-high, with shellacked side wings to boot. Of her "mall hair" style, she noted, "You know, the bangs that stick straight up off the top of your head. That was ridiculous." Maybe...but everyone was doing it.
Shannen Doherty, 1990-93
Doherty claimed she was fired from 90210 for doing a DIY hack job on her trademark "Brenda Walsh" bangs. "I cried over a bad haircut because I got fired over it," she told The Talk. (Fortunately, the TV gods later spared Felicity.)
