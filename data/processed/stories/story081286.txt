MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- A Florida high school student was killed Tuesday by another student during an altercation at the school, officials said.
One student was killed following an argument between first and second periods, police at the scene said.
The incident occurred just after 9 a.m. at Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, the officials said. The school was placed on lockdown after the incident.
Two students were arguing between the first and second period at the school, and one produced a weapon and killed the other, police at the scene told reporters.
Miami-Dade Public Schools identified the victim Tuesday afternoon as Juan Carlos Rivera, 17. The students involved were both males, the district said.
CNN affiliate WSVN reported the student was killed in the courtyard area of the school, where the 17-year-old was stabbed in the chest.
A suspect was taken into custody just after the incident and was being interviewed, officials said. His name was not released.
Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said students' parents were being contacted after the incident, and crisis psychologists were being made available to students, faculty and parents.  Watch as bystanders gather at the Florida high school »
"I think we need to understand that whether it's Liberty City, Opa-Locka or Coral Gables, children are responding to everyday stressful situations in very negative ways," Carvalho said. "... Random acts of violence like the one we saw here today are almost not preventable."
Coral Gables is about 8 miles southwest of Miami.
