LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Love hurts, especially for jilted lovers on Valentine's Day.
With that in mind, a London tourist attraction is offering visitors the chance to curse former boyfriends, girlfriends or spouses -- and get a discount on the entry price at the same time.
"Hex your Ex" is the Valentine's Day promotion at the London Dungeon, a house of horrors that takes visitors through elements of the city's bloody, gruesome, and torturous past.
To qualify, visitors must bring a picture of their ex -- or anyone who has  shunned them -- then rip it up and throw it in a smoking cauldron, spokeswoman Kate Edwards told CNN. Visitors can then select from a range of curses to inflict on their ex.
"If you happen to be single or freshly shunned, this is a way to move on and have a great way of doing it," Edwards said.
Hexing your ex will earn you £5 ($7.20) off the entry price.
"It's very therapeutic, but it means in times of the credit crunch, you get money off as well," she said.
The "curses" are meant to be taken lightly, she said. All were developed by the Dungeon's creative team.
"They involve marvelously bad things happening to your ex," she said. "Nothing deadly, obviously. It's obviously tongue-in-cheek."
