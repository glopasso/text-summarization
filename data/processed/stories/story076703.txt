Enchanting crystal clear waters protected by a coral reef, with white sandy beaches that stretch hundreds of kilometers: This is Watamu, an old fishing village on the Indian Ocean, in southeast Kenya.
Located around 100km (62 miles) up the coast from Kenya's second city, Mombasa, Watamu has long been known for its rich Swahili culture and its history. Now it's also known as one of the country's most impressive vacation spots, and an incredible water sports haven.
The trade winds that blow in the afternoons make it ideal for windsurfing and kitesurfing, while paddleboarders have the chance to get close to the many species of dolphin that swim in the ocean. CNN's Inside Africa visited Watamu and got a chance to sample its famous water sports first hand. Watch the video above to see what happened.
