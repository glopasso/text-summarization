A suspect has been detained in connection with the murder of a Russian TV anchor who worked for the "360 Moscow region" TV station, Russia's Investigative Committee said Wednesday
Andrey Rybakin's body was found on Tuesday evening, the TV station's chief executive, Vyacheslav Dukhin, said. The 25-year-old had apparently been murdered a few days before in his Moscow apartment.
Russia's Investigative Committee said on its website that the man detained was a friend of Rybakin who is suspected of killing the journalist after an argument at the apartment.
Rybakin had his own show based on humorous video clips from vehicle dashboard cameras, Dukhin said. The devices are very popular in Russia.
"Andrey was a talented journalist, and a kind man," said Dukhin. "This is a very sad loss for us."
