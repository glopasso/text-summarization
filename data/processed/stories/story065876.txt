In 2013, CNN bookworms turned to the masters.
We asked our readers to vote on their top 10 favorite books of the year, and the results are filled with literary hotshots and household names. From Donna Tartt to Khaled Hosseini to Dan Brown, the titles that turn up on our list of readers' 10 favorite books of the year are going to be familiar whether you consider yourself a big reader or not.
Yet not all the spaces were taken up by the well-known greats: at least one book, "Reconstructing Amelia," was threatened to be overshadowed by the fall's onslaught of heavy-hitters, but CNN readers hadn't forgotten its suspenseful tale.
Another surprise entry was John Green's "The Fault in Our Stars" which, being a 2012 release, we didn't expect to see on a list of 2013 picks. But thanks to the numerous readers who wrote in votes for the tough but engrossing novel, Green's work shines for another year.
If you missed our voting period, feel free to play along in the comments. Tell us your top 10 favorite books of the year.
