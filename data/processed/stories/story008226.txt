President Barack Obama says his feelings aren't hurt by Democrats who don't want to campaign side-by-side with him because those candidates are "strong allies and supporters of me" when casting votes in Congress.
"The bottom line is, though, these are all folks who vote with me. They have supported my agenda in Congress," Obama said on Al Sharpton's radio show Monday, ticking off measures like a minimum wage increase, equal pay, investments in infrastructure and early childhood education.
"So, this isn't about my feelings being hurt," he said. "These are folks who are strong allies and supporters of me. And I tell them, I said, 'You know what, you do what you need to win. I will be responsible for making sure that our voters turn up.'"
His comments were similar to ones he made at Northwestern University earlier this month -- which Republicans immediately plugged into campaign ads. Those comments, former White House adviser David Axelrod said, were a political mistake.
Obama's remarks could harm endangered red-state Democrats and offer a boost to Republicans who need to capture six seats to gain control of the Senate for the President's final two years in office.
