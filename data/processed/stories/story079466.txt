(Rolling Stone) -- The returning Justin Timberlake and upstart rappers Macklemore and Ryan Lewis top the list of best-selling recording artists at the midyear point of 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan.
As of June 30, Timberlake's "The 20/20 Experience" has sold just over two million copies -- the only album to do so thus far this year.

(703,000) and Imagine Dragons' "Night Visions" (692,000).
