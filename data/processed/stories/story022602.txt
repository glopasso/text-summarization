A US Airways flight attendant was found dead in his hotel room in Mexico City, company spokeswoman Tina Swail said Saturday.
Authorities are investigating the circumstances of Nick Aaronson's death, she said.
A spokesman for the attorney general in Mexico City said authorities were called in the early morning to the Hilton Hotel, where they found the body of a man, estimated to have been between 30 and 35 years old.
His body indicated he had been struck several times, Rene Hernandez Cueto said.
Investigators are collecting evidence in the case, he added.
Preliminary reports do not indicate a safety breach at the hotel, according to a statement from the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) Council 66.
"Therefore, we do not believe our crew members are at risk. However, until this matter is resolved, layover crews will be temporarily relocated to an alternative location," said the union.
Deborah Volpe, president of AFA Council 66, described Aaronson as "very popular" and a "much-loved flight attendant."
"This was a very tragic event and it has affected us all. Right now, we are focusing on taking care of our crew members," she said.
