Leading Japanese golfers Ai Miyazoto, Mika Miyazoto and Momuku Ueda have joined forces in launching a website to aid the rescue effort in their native country following the recent earthquake and tsunami.
Speaking ahead of this week's $1.7 million Kia Classic in California, the trio revealed they have created a fund-raising website for a relief organization to combat the devastation.
All three players, who were in Japan when the disaster struck, have designed buttons with a Japanese logo which translates into: "Never Give Up Japan".
They will be wearing the buttons on their caps during this week's LPGA event and have also distributed them to their fellow-players in an effort to promote the website further.
Current world number one Yani Tseng wore one of the buttons at her press conference for the tournament.
World number six, Ai Miyazoto told a news conference: "My whole family lives in Okinawa which is way down south from Tokyo, so they are all safe.
"But I went to high school in Sendai City, so I know many people over there. I heard everyone is safe but some of my friends lost their houses and they stay together in a gymnasium," she added.
World No.51 Ueda added:  "I think all three of us had an idea of what we wanted to do to help.
"But the reason why all three of us got together is because by doing it together, we could have a bigger influence."
