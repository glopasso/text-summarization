Running back Todd Gurley, one of the front-runners for college football's Heisman Trophy, was suspended indefinitely on Thursday by the University of Georgia as the school investigates a possible violation of NCAA rules.
"I'm obviously very disappointed," Georgia head football coach Mark Richt said in a two-paragraph statement on the school's athletics department website.
Gurley has rushed for 773 yards in five games and scored eight touchdowns for 10th-ranked Georgia. He also had a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown.
The Bulldogs are scheduled to play at Missouri on Saturday.
Georgia didn't say what kind of alleged violation officials are investigating.
Bleacher Report predicted this week that Gurley, a junior from Tarboro, North Carolina, will be a mid-first round pick in next year's NFL draft.
