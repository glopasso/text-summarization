What was old is new again - at least that's the way it is for early voting. Before the second Tuesday after the first Monday in November was declared Election Day by federal law in 1845, states voted on different days and over different periods of time. It wasn't until the last decade that early voting began to pick up steam again.
In 2004, 22% of Americans voted early and that rate rose to more than 30% in 2008, according to Paul Gronke, professor of Political Science who founded and runs the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College in Oregon. Gronke estimates that as much as 40% of eligible voters will cast an early ballot during the 2012 election.
With the trend changing the way Americans vote and campaigns campaign, we decided to take a look, by the numbers, at early voting in the United States:
35: States (including the District of Columbia) that allow early voting.
2: States with all mail-in voting. Washington and Oregon don't have traditional polling places.

28: Percent of Florida voters who said in 2004 they preferred early voting because of the convenience.
30: Percent who said they didn't feel like standing in a long line to vote.
