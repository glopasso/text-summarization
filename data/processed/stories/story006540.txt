Pakistani and Afghan forces clashed Thursday near the border of the two countries in a gun battle that left at least one Afghan border policeman dead, an Afghan official said.
Zia Durrani, a spokesman for the police chief of the southern Afghan province of Kandahar, said Pakistani forces attacked Afghan police checkpoints on the border early Thursday morning.
He said that the gun battle between the two sides in Maroof district was still going on, but that the first hour was very intense.
The Pakistanis were using light and heavy machine guns, Durrani said.
The Pakistani military didn't immediately respond to calls from CNN seeking comment.
