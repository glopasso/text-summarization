(EW.com) -- What mischief is Phil about to get into now?
EW has learned exclusively that Kevin Hart ("Little Fockers") has signed on for a guest-starring role on "Modern Family."
He'll play Andre, a new neighbor of Phil Dunphy who happens to be a physician. The 32-year-old comedian will see a familiar face when he begins production on the ABC comedy: He co-starred opposite Sofia Vergara in the 2004 movie "Soul Plane."
Recently, Hart and his Hartbeat Productions notched an unexpected victory at the box office with his debut standup film "Laugh at My Pain," which follows his recent national tour run and a stop in his hometown of Philadelphia. It debuted inside of the box office top 10 ranking and pulled in nearly $2 million, in just 97 theaters, for an impressive per-location gross of $20,619. The film only cost $750,000 to make.
Hart has appeared in several Comedy Central specials and hosted the 2011 BET Awards. His other film credits include the movies "Krod Mondoon" and the "Flaming Sword of Fire," "Death at a Funeral," and "Epic Movie."
