After weeks on the run and days in immigration detention, American technology pioneer John McAfee arrived in Miami on Wednesday.
He said he had no choice in the matter, that Guatemalan authorities expelled him to the United States and put him on a plane to a destination they determined.
"I was whisked out of prison," McAfee told CNN affiliate broadcaster WSVN in front of his South Beach hotel. "I was forcibly separated from Samantha, and now here I am."
Samantha Venegas is McAfee's girlfriend.
When the plane landed, U.S. officials boarded the aircraft to greet him and escort him off.

It was unclear whether he planned to stay in Miami or where he might go next.
For the past week, McAfee waged a public battle, requesting an asylum in Guatemala and arguing that police in Belize were persecuting him. Authorities turned down his request and told him he would have to leave the country.
"He opted to return to his country of origin," said attorney Telesforo Guerra, who has represented McAfee since he arrived in Guatemala last week.
Authorities in Belize, where McAfee had lived since 2008, say they want to talk to McAfee about the November 11 killing of his neighbor, American businessman Gregory Faull.
McAfee said he had nothing to do with the death and insists he left Belize to escape police persecution.
Guatemalan authorities took him into custody on accusations of entering the country illegally, and his asylum bid was rejected.
McAfee told WSVN he has openly criticized Belize's government for seven months, making himself a "thorn in their side."
"Unfortunately, now that I'm here, they can't shut me up," he said.
