Just a week after losing to Bubba Watson in a playoff at the U.S. Masters, Louis Oosthuizen bounced back with a three-shot victory in the Malaysian Open Sunday.
Oosthuizen, who had a 30-hour journey to Kuala Lumpur after his near miss at Augusta, closed with a four-under-par 68 to hold off the challenge of Scotland's Stephen Gallacher.
His 17-under total of 271 gave him his fifth European Tour win and for Oosthuizen acted as the perfect tonic after his Masters heartbreak.
"It was a long journey to get here and I have to be honest and say that I didn't expect to play this well because of the tiredness," he told the official European Tour website.
"Having a good week this week was important and playing well. I didn't want to come here and play bad but to win means a lot because I have been playing well for the last few weeks now and to win gives me a lot of confidence for the rest of the season."
Oosthuizen had to play 26 holes on the final day because of earlier delays and held a one-shot lead over Gallacher going into the last 18 holes.
Gallacher, looking for his second European Tour win, was in touch until the back nine where his South African opponent birdied the 13th and 16th to pull clear.
Last year's Masters champion Charl Schwartzel of South African was sixth, six shots back, while defending champion Matteo Manassero and former world number one Martin Kaymer tied for seventh at the $2.5 million tournament co-sanctioned by the European and Asian Tours.
Oosthuizen, who carded a stunning double eagle in his final round of the first major of the season, lost out to Watson after the American's superb recovery shot on the second extra hole, but he has moved to second in the European Tour's Race to Dubai after his recent fine displays.
