Pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine headline 19 newcomers to the National Baseball Hall of Fame ballot, the Baseball Writers' Association of America announced Tuesday.
Maddux and Glavine -- both 300-game winners who won multiple Cy Young Awards -- are on the ballot for the first time. Other notable first-timers include Frank Thomas, Jeff Kent and Mike Mussina.
Another newcomer is Eric Gagne, who was named in baseball's Mitchell Report on performance-enhancing drug use. Gagne admitted in 2010 to using human growth hormone. He joins other players from the heart of the steroid era who are back on the ballot: Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa.
But many of this year's newcomers are perceived to have had clean careers, making this ballot one of the best in history.
Maddux won four consecutive National League Cy Young Awards from 1992 to 1995. He also won a record 18 Gold Glove Awards in his 23-year career. Maddux won 355 games with a 3.16 earned-run average, led the NL in ERA four times and won at least 15 games for 17 consecutive seasons. He played for the Chicago Cubs, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres.
Glavine won the NL Cy Young in 1991 and 1998 and was a 10-time All-Star. He won 305 games in 22 seasons with the Braves and the New York Mets. He won 20 games in a season five times and won four Silver Slugger Awards.
Thomas won back-to-back American League MVP Awards with the Chicago White Sox in 1993 and 1994. He finished his 19-year career with 2,468 hits, 521 home runs and 1,704 RBIs.
Kent was named the NL MVP in 2000 and hit 377 home runs in his 17 seasons spanning the San Francisco Giants, Mets, Dodgers, Toronto Blue Jays, Cleveland Indians and Houston Astros.
Mussina won 270 games and had a career .638 winning percentage in 18 seasons with the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees.
A total of 36 players will be on this year's ballot. The complete ballot is: Moises Alou, Jeff Bagwell, Armando Benitez, Craig Biggio, Bonds, Sean Casey, Clemens, Ray Durham, Gagne, Glavine, Luis Gonzalez, Jacque Jones, Todd Jones, Kent, Paul Lo Duca, Maddux, Edgar Martinez, Don Mattingly, Fred McGriff, McGwire, Jack Morris, Mussina, Hideo Nomo, Rafael Palmeiro, Mike Piazza, Tim Raines, Kenny Rogers, Curt Schilling, Richie Sexson, Lee Smith, J.T. Snow, Sosa, Thomas, Mike Timlin, Alan Trammell and Larry Walker.
Last year, for the first time since 1996, no one was inducted into the Hall of Fame. Candidates need at least 75 percent of the vote to be elected, and a player has never been unanimously voted into the Hall of Fame.
Results will be announced January 8. Inductions will be July 24 in Cooperstown, New York.
