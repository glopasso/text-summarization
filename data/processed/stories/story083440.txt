Mohammed Bdaiwi, the Baghdad bureau chief of Radio Free Iraq, was shot and killed Saturday in Baghdad, police said.
Bdaiwi was on his way to his office, near the residence of Iraqi President Jalal Talabani, when he was shot by a military guard after an argument between them, the radio station reported.
According to his media outlet, Bdaiwi was driving his car through the guarded gate at the compound that houses his bureau as well as the presidential residence when he got in an argument with a guard.
The guard shot the journalist and fled inside the compound. The guard was eventually handed over to police once Iraq's prime minister made a surprise appearance to demand that he be taken into custody, the station reported.
In addition to being a journalist, Bdaiwi was also an author and professor at a university in Baghdad.
Iraq has been beset by violence over the last year. At least 10 people were killed Saturday in shootings and explosion across Iraq, police said. On Friday, at least 38 people were killed in a wave of violence.
Radio Free Iraq is a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
