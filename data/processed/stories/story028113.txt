For their extraordinary efforts to help change the world and better the lives of others, 10 everyday people will receive $50,000 and a chance for much more.
This select group -- the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2012 -- will be revealed at noon Thursday on CNN.com.
All the top 10 were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN. They will be honored at "CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute," a globally broadcast event that airs live December 2 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT.
At the tribute show, hosted by Anderson Cooper in Los Angeles, one of the top 10 will be named CNN Hero of the Year and receive an additional $250,000 to continue their work.
The Hero of the Year is decided by a public vote. Starting at noon, you will be able to vote for your favorite Hero at CNNHeroes.com or from your mobile device. Voting ends November 28.
Last year's Hero of the Year, Robin Lim, was recognized for her efforts to help thousands of poor Indonesians have a healthy pregnancy and birth. Through her Bumi Sehat health clinics, Lim offers free prenatal care, birthing services and medical aid in Indonesia, where many families cannot afford care.
"I found that if you have a good idea and you do it with love, a lot of people want to help you," Lim told Cooper after the show.
This is the sixth year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 180 people on CNN and CNN.com.
