(Mashable) -- Rovio Entertainment, known for its intense focus on one mega-successful game title, "Angry Birds," is looking to diversify with another new mobile game called "Amazing Alex."
The title is a rebranding of "Casey's Contraptions," which Rovio bought from developers Noel Llopis and Miguel A. Friginal earlier this month. Rovio CEO Mikael Hed told Finnish TV station Yle that the latest game "has an educational element and centers on the main character Alex, a curious young boy who loves to build things." The title is expected to be released within the next two months.
"Casey's Contraptions" is another physics-based game along the lines of "Angry Birds." The game features Rube Goldberg-type contraptions that are made from items like balloons, soccer balls, scissors and buckets.
Rovio announced the billionth download of "Angry Birds" last week. The company, which released the game in 2009, offers four different versions of the game -- "Angry Birds Space" is the latest. In addition, Rovio is working on a movie, TV show and theme park based on the property.
What do you think? Can Rovio be known for something beyond "Angry Birds"? Sound off in the comments.
