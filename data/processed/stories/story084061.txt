Soulja Boy faces three felony charges stemming from an early morning traffic stop in which police say they found "a felony amount" of marijuana, firearms and "a substantial amount of cash."
The 21-year-old rapper, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, posted a $10,000 bond Tuesday afternoon after spending about a dozen hours in the Carroll County, Georgia, jail, according to a police spokeswoman.
Soulja Boy was riding in a rented Black Cadillac Escalade with four other men on Interstate 20 about 50 miles west of Atlanta when they were stopped for a routine traffic violation at 2:30 a.m., according to Temple Police spokeswoman Dana Rampy.
Temple Police Officer Lat Gray arrested all five men after he found the pot, cash and firearms, Rampy said.
The men were "very cordial" and cooperative with police, she said.
Each faces three felony counts, including possession of marijuana, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm in commission of a crime, Rampy said.
Soulja Boy's representatives did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment.
