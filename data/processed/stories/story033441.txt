Bulgarian and Greek police have arrested at least 11 people for allegedly trafficking babies, authorities in both countries said Tuesday.
Six people were arrested in Greece, including a doctor and lawyer, while five people were detained in Bulgaria, according to a statement from the Bulgarian interior ministry. The investigation, dubbed "Operation Babies," discovered 14 cases of women who had agreed to sell their newborns, it said.
A spokesman for the Greek police said 12 people were arrested -- seven in Greece and five in Bulgaria.
Pregnant women from poor families in Bulgaria were brought to Greece, where they were given a place to stay before and for a few days after the birth of their children, the Bulgarian statement said. Clients paid up to 20,000 euros for a boy and around 15,000 euros for a girl, it said. The mothers were reportedly given no more than 1,500 euros per child.
The police spokesman in Greece said the price of the baby also depended on the color of its skin. Most clients were childless couples, he said.
Police were tipped off by a woman who gave birth to a baby girl in Greece, the Bulgarian ministry said. She reportedly refused to leave the child, which was then taken from her by force, said the statement. The baby is expected to be reunited with her mother.
