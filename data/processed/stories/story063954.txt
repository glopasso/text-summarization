Opposition protests are expected to take place in Tunisia on Tuesday following the interim prime minister's decision not to dissolve the government.
Ali Larayedh on Saturday met with political party heads and leaders of the military and professional organizations.
Also in attendance were representatives from several labor unions, according to TAP, Tunisia's state news agency.
The meeting "aimed to deepen dialogue around the security situation in light of the terrorist operations that hit Tunisia recently," according to TAP.
Two opposition groups called for Tunisian citizens to "participate massively" in a Tuesday rally in Bardo. The rally will mark the six-month anniversary of the assassination of popular opposition leader Chokri Belaid.
Belaid helped lead Tunisia's Popular Front, a coalition of a leftist political parties. He opposed the Islamist-led Nahda party, which swept into power following the revolution that toppled longtime President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.
In recent weeks, eight Tunisian soldiers were killed in an ambush and an opposition leader was shot and killed outside his home, which set off protests.
Turmoil has beset the North African country that had been seen as a poster child of stability after the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings.
