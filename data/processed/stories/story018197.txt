Boys may become men, but they will always be their mothers' sons.
That's the lesson two brothers, on opposite ends of the political spectrum, learned the hard way Tuesday when their mother called from North Carolina into C-SPAN to ask them both to -- please -- cool it before Christmas.
"Oh God, it's Mom," Dallas Woodhouse said as soon as he realized the woman calling the show was their mother. He dropped his head into his hands.
Dallas Woodhouse and his brother, Brad, were on C-SPAN to discuss their documentary "Woodhouse Divided," which looks at divides in family and politics.
Their mother was not pleased.
"I disagree that all families are like ours. I don't know many families that are fighting at Thanksgiving," said Joy Woodhouse, stealing the show. "I'm hoping you'll have some of this out of your system when you come here for Christmas."
Like so many others this time of year, Joy Woodhouse just wants to have a happy holiday.
"I would really like a peaceful Christmas," she said. "And I love you both."
Brad Woodhouse is president of Americans United for Change, a progressive group. Dallas Woodhouse is president and founder of Carolina Rising, a conservative group.
