An armed man hijacked a Greyhound bus Thursday in North Carolina and took the passengers on a short, wild ride before being arrested.
The bus was traveling to Raleigh, North Carolina, when the gun-toting passenger approached the driver Thursday night, said Maureen Richmond, a Greyhound spokeswoman.
The passenger screamed for the driver to pull over. The driver did.
Thirty-three of passengers were allowed to get off the bus at that time, according to Vance County Sheriff Peter White.
The driver, the gunman and the two remaining passengers then continued on to a nearby gas station where police were waiting.
The suspect, identified as Jose Flores, was shocked with a stun gun and then arrested, said White.
Flores faces a charge of one count of kidnapping, said Capt. Shawn Bridges at the Warren County jail.
Authorities were trying to determine why the hijacking occurred.
