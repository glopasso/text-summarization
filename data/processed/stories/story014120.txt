Hugo Almeida scored a hat-trick and was then sent off as he helped Werder Bremen to end a miserable run of results on Sunday with a 3-0 victory at home to St. Pauli, who also ended the game with 10 men.
Thomas Schaaf's team, knocked out of the Champions League in midweek and already out of the German Cup, won for the first time in eight Bundesliga matches.
Bremen had not scored for 450 minutes, but Portugal striker Almeida ended that drought after just 52 seconds.
St. Pauli's Gerald Asamoah headed against the bar a minute later, but Almeida extended the lead in the 20th minute as Marko Marin set him up on the counterattack from a corner at the other end.
St. Pauli again hit the woodwork in the second half when Tim Wiese tipped Marius Ebbers' shot onto the bar, but Almeida sealed victory in the 64th minute with his ninth league goal this season after a fine pass by Said Hsejinovic.
Kagawa on target as Dortmund win
However, he was sent off with 10 minutes to go after lashing out at St. Pauli defender Carlos Zambrano, whose teammate Markus Thorandt saw red in the final minute for a foul on Torsten Frings.
The result means promoted St. Pauli have now not won for six matches and have fallen to 14th in the table, two points above the bottom three.
Mainz make ground on German leaders
Relegation-threatened Cologne moved up to 16th and out of the bottom two despite conceding a late equalizer in the 1-1 draw at home to Wolfsburg.
Slovenia striker Milivoje Novakovic put Cologne ahead six minutes after halftime, scoring from close range when keeper Diego Benaglio could not hold a free-kick by Portuguese midfielder Petit.
Wolfsburg, who lost striker Grafite to injury late in the first half, earned a point in the 81st minute through substitute Cicero -- who smashed in a superb overhead kick soon after coming onto the pitch.
Steve McClaren's team ended the weekend in 13th place on 16 points -- 21 behind leaders Borussia Dortmund.
