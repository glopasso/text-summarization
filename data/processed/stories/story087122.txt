Mariah Carey is "fine" a day after an accident during a video shoot in New York on Sunday night, her representative said Monday.
"Mariah injured herself while filming a video with Jeezy for the remix of #Beautiful, directed by her husband Nick Cannon," said rep Cindi Berger.
"She was taken to hospital late last night, where doctors reset her shoulder. She is fine."
She recently released two remixes of "#Beautiful" featuring Miguel.
The release of her new album, which was set for July, has been delayed "in order to have more time on it," according to her website.
