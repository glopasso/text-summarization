An explosion at a North Carolina chemical plant Saturday ignited a fire and forced the evacuation of some 750 people, an official said.
The local fire department received a call about an explosion at Chemical Coatings Inc. around 3 p.m. ET, said Denise Michaud, Caldwell County health director.
The blast ignited a fire, which was under control, but still burning Saturday at 6 p.m. ET, she said.
Aerial video of the scene showed huge plumes of white smoke rising as firefighters blasted the blaze with water.
No injures were reported.
Residents living within one mile of the plant, which makes aerosols and other coating products, were told to evacuate, Michaud said.
It was not immediately known what caused the explosion.
