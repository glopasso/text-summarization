(EW.com) -- Ready to feel old?
Just in time for the 20th anniversary (!!) of "Boy Meets World" premiering on ABC, all seven seasons of the show are coming to DVD as a boxed set for the first time. This means that for those who haven't yet discovered the wonders of YouTube all your favorite footage — from Adam Scott guest appearances to The Feeny Call — is all in one place. A behind-the-scenes feature "Back To the Beginning" will also be included and features the cast talking about their characters; it's not clear if this was taped recently or put together from archival footage.
