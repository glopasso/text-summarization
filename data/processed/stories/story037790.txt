The most destructive fire in Colorado's history is now 90% contained, officials said Wednesday.
The Waldo Canyon Fire near Colorado Springs burned more than 18,000 acres after starting June 23, prompting the evacuation of several neighborhoods days later.
The wildfire destroyed 346 homes, according to InciWeb, a website that gathers fire information from various U.S. agencies. It called the fire the most destructive in state history.
The Colorado Office of Emergency Management says it is monitoring four other major fires in the state, two of which were contained as of Wednesday evening.
The threat of fire is still high across the state. As a result, no Independence Day fireworks are allowed on public lands, said Rick Barton, an information officer for the Pine Ridge Fire burning near Grand Junction.
Other fireworks shows are being allowed only by special permits, he said, and no charcoal grills are allowed outside in most of the state.
