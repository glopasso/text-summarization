Sudan has ordered a French medical aid agency out of South Darfur state, accusing the organization of supporting rebel forces and for releasing what it called false rape reports against forces loyal to the Khartoum government, according to state-run media.
Sudan News Agency (SUNA) announced the expulsion of Medecins du Monde on Tuesday.
Appearing at a news conference in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, Gov. Abdel Hamid Moussa Kasha accused the organization of sharing intelligence with the rebels of the Sudan Liberation Movement, giving them access to satellite telephones and medicine.
Kasha also accused the organization of publishing false rape reports and for delivering tons of expired medications to eastern Jebel Marra via the joint African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur.
Médecins du Monde, or Doctors of the World, describes itself on its website as "an international humanitarian organisation providing medical care to vulnerable populations affected by war, natural disasters, disease, famine, poverty or exclusion," and has a network extending to 16 countries in four continents.
