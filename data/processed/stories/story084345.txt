Marc Marquez continued his record breaking 2014 MotoGP season with a 10th straight win Sunday to match the feat of Australian Mick Doohan in 1997.
The reigning world champion has proved all-conquering on his Repsol Honda but was pushed all the way in Indianapolis by Yamaha pair Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi, who occupied the other podium positions.
Rossi briefly led before slipping back to the third place, but the points saw him become the first man to top 4,000 in MotoGP.
"It was a good start though as I was able to lead. I tried to push to the limit to stay with Marc but he got past. I would have hoped to have a bit of a better battle with Lorenzo. But I am satisfied." the Italian legend told the official MotoGP website.
Marquez took the lead on lap 11 as he found his way past the Yamaha pair and eventually finished two seconds clear by the finish.
His teammate Dani Pedrosa finished fourth as he came through from eighth.
Pol Espargaro (Monster Yamaha Tech3) took a fine fifth with his British teammate Bradley Smith in sixth after a heavy crash in Saturday practice.
Smith's compatriot Cal Crutchlow (Ducati) was seventh with his teammate Andrea Dovizioso in eighth.
But it was Marquez again who took the plaudits to continue his remarkable run and he is already looking to the next round in Brno in the Czech Republic.
"The race was very hard, especially as the track temperature was very high. I struggled a little with the front tyre so I stayed behind Rossi to try to keep the front tire cool,"he said.
He added, "We will try to fight for the victory in Brno. The test we had went well but it was very slippery so we don't have too much data. I have never gone great there and Jorge and Vale are very strong there."
