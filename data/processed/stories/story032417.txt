Marc Marquez, Spain's racing prodigy, finished fourth in the Czech MotoGP Sunday ending his hopes of winning a record eleven races in a row.
His Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa won his first race of the season in Brno, where he also won in 2012.
Yamaha duo Jorge Lorenzo and Valentino Rossi finished second and third respectively.
"I was able to do a good race, I'm happy, I had a good pace and it's another podium," Rossi said after the race.
"It was a great pleasure to beat Marc one time."
Before the race all eyes were on Marquez and whether he could beat Italian legend Giacomo Agostini's record of winning the first ten races of the 1968, 1969 and 1970 seasons.
Whilst a race season only lasted ten races back then, no one has won the first eleven in the modern era.
But his Spanish teammate Pedrosa instead prevailed, a victory that British two-time World Superbike Champion James Toseland believes will stand Marquez in good stead.
"I think everyone appreciates the dedication he puts in," Toseland said in an interview with CNN's World Sport.
"He's a World Champion at 20, but he's been at it for 15 years ... The handcuffs are off with that fourth place. Now Marc can relax. He can't win them all now."
Despite finishing fourth Marquez is still 77 points ahead in the standings and will hope to bounce back in Great Britain in two weeks time.
