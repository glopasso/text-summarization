A developmentally delayed teen girl is missing and might be in danger, Massachusetts State Police said Wednesday.
Brittany Thompson, 17, of Medfield, was last seen on Monday leaving Medfield Public Library with a man, according to police, who cited a videotape.
Thompson, is about 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds. She has braces and was wearing a red sleeveless shirt, blue jeans and flip flops. Brittany is developmentally delayed, according to Massachusetts State Police.
The person she was leaving with was a heavy-set white male, wearing a "Sons of Anarchy" T-shirt and slicked-back hair, according to the statement.
"In the videotape, she looks like she walks out of the library voluntarily," Medfield Police Chief Robert Meaney told CNN on Wednesday.
"This is not an abduction, no crime of any sort," Meaney continued. "Right now, we have a girl who walked out of the library with an unknown guy and we are trying to figure out who he is."
Meaney said that Thompson's parents do not know the man in the surveillance video from the library.
Although the current situation is not deemed criminal, the state police said, "We have reason to believe Brittany Thompson is endangered," in their statement.
Anyone with information about Thompson's whereabouts or has information on the man is asked to call Massachusetts State Police at 508-820-2121.
