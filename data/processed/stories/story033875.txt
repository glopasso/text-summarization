Oscar Pistorius was on the stumps of his amputated legs when he knocked down a locked toilet door with a cricket bat to reach his shot girlfriend, a police forensic expert said Wednesday, countering the track star's assertion he was wearing his prosthetic legs at the time.
South African police colonel J.G. Vermeulen took the stand to discuss marks on a cricket bat and a bent steel plate found in the bathroom door after the athlete shot model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year.
Wielding the cricket bat in his hands, Vermuelen squatted down before swinging it at the actual wooden door in a court reconstruction to show the angle of the marks. He said the location of the spots on the door was consistent with Pistorius not wearing his prosthetic legs.
"From the forensic evidence, he was on his stumps," Vermeulen said.
Defense attorney Barry Roux countered by suggesting that even with his prosthetic legs on, Pistorius would not be swinging a bat at the same height as an able-bodied person.
In a change from his bail hearing, when the state based its case for a premeditated murder charge on Pistorius having had his prosthetic legs on when he fired the shots, the prosecution said Wednesday he was on his stumps during the shooting and when he bashed down the door. The track star has said he didn't have his prosthetics on when he shot at the toilet door after hearing a noise, but then put them on when he tried to break open the door, realizing his girlfriend may be inside.
The door is being used in the Pretoria court to show the trajectory of the bullets fired at Steenkamp, which both sides can use to argue whether it was premeditated murder or not.
Pistorius, the first double-amputee to run in the Olympic Games, regularly wears prosthetic legs. If he was not wearing them at the time, the trajectory of the bullets would be lower and the defense can argue that he was feeling vulnerable and didn't have time to think.
The 27-year old has pleaded not guilty to murder in the shooting. He admits killing Steenkamp, 29, by shooting her through a locked bathroom door in his house. However, he says that he mistook her for a burglar in the middle of the night and that the shooting was a tragic mistake. Pistorius has said he tried to break open the door when he realized he'd shot Steenkamp.
Door in focus
The court heard that the door was intact before the shots were fired.
Under cross-examination, Vermeulen said the first and only time he went to the crime scene was on March 8, 2013, nearly a month after the shooting. Asked about a mark on the door which he did not investigate, he said it was not from a cricket bat.
Roux asserted it was the mark of a prosthetic leg kicking the door with a sock on and that fabric remained in the mark on the door. Vermeulen was unwilling to accept that that was the only possible explanation.
Vermeulen told the court there were footprints consistent with police shoes on the bathroom door at one point and photos of this were shown. They were later removed and Vermeulen said he did not know how. He said that from photos, he knew the door was removed from its hinges and left on the floor for some time.
When Roux suggested they were wiped off by someone who did not know the importance of police procedure, Vermeulen chuckled.
Close-up photographs of the damaged door were shown in court, as well as scuffs on the autographed cricket bat, prompting a Tweet from former South African test cricketer Herschelle Gibbs: â€
