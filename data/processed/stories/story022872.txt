Celebrity Chef Jamie Oliver will serve a dinner of Scottish organic salmon, Welsh lamb and a traditional Bakewell Tart for G-20 leaders at the prime minister's residence Wednesday.
Jamie Oliver has devised menu G-20 leaders will eat during a visit to Prime Minister Gordon Brown's residence.
Oliver will use traditional ingredients and recipes inspired from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales and the Channel Islands for the dinner at 10 Downing Street, a statement on his Web site said.
Oliver will cook the meal along with a team of young chefs from the apprentice program at his London restaurant, Fifteen.
Because some guests have special dietary requirements, Oliver said he will be offering vegetarian options for both a starter and the main course.
Here is the menu, as published on Oliver's Web site:
Baked Scottish Salmon with Seashore Vegetables, Broad Beans, Herb Garden Salad, Mayonnaise and Wild Garlic-scented Irish Soda bread.
Vegetarian option: Childwickbury Goat's Cheese with Roast Shallots, Seashore Vegetables, Herb Green Salad and Wild Garlic-scented Irish Soda Bread (no mayo)
Slow-Roasted Shoulder of Welsh Lamb, very-first-of-the-season Jersey Royals (potatoes), first-of-the-season Asparagus and Wild St. George Mushrooms. Mint Sauce and Gravy.
Vegetarian option: Lovage & Potato Dumplings with first-of-the-season Asparagus and Wild St. George Mushrooms
Hot Bakewell Tart with Homemade Custard.
Oliver is known for his healthy, low-budget approach to cooking with local ingredients. In addition to his restaurants, Oliver has published cookbooks and hosted TV cooking shows, including "The Naked Chef," which was about hearty, simple food.
