(CNN)The New York City clinic where Joan Rivers underwent a procedure before her death will no longer be eligible to receive funds for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries at the end of this month.
The Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) conducted several surveys of the Yorkville Endoscopy Center and found that deficiencies in safety had not been addressed.
The Yorkville Endoscopy Center says it plans to appeal.
"We are continuing to work with all regulatory bodies. We intend to communicate with CMS and appropriate authorities to have the decision reversed. Yorkville continues to be a licensed facility and perform procedures while cooperating with the regulatory process."
The center has been surveyed several times since the August 28 appointment with Rivers.  In a letter from CMS to the Yorkville center, it says the center continues to be noncompliant with the following: governing body and management, surgical services, quality assessment and performance improvement and environment.
Rivers died on September 4, a week after she underwent a procedure at the Upper East Side clinic.  A report by CMS in November found the clinic failed to identify her deteriorating vital signs, failed to consistently document the dose of propofol, a sedative, that was administered and a number of other serious mistakes.
CNN's Susan Candiotti and Marina Carver contributed to this report.
