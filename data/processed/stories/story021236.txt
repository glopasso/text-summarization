Two West Virginia officers were shot and wounded Thursday in a traffic stop on Interstate 64 that led to the discovery of two bodies.
According to state police Lt. Michael Baylous, two police officers from the town of Lewisburg pulled over a white Chevrolet SUV with North Carolina plates after learning it had been reported stolen.
As the officers were conducting the traffic stop, a red Chevrolet truck pulled alongside them and the driver "pulled a handgun and shot at both officers," Baylous said.

The drivers of both Chevrolets then fled: the red truck "went over the hillside and was eventually taken into custody," while the other motorist "drove behind a guardrail on the interstate and hid for a short amount of time," according to Baylous.
"Eventually, he walked up to the interstate and turned himself into law enforcement without incident."
Neither driver has been named, but they informed police that they were father and son.
When police searched the red truck allegedly being driven by dad, they found two "recently deceased bodies" hidden under a mattress. "It is believed that the victims are from North Carolina," Baylous said.
Baylous said, "the two suspects will be arrested for malicious assault and attempted murder of a police officer."
The officers -- who also have not been named -- were taken to Greenbrier Valley Medical Center. Their conditions were not immediately known Thursday night.
