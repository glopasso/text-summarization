Real Madrid have completed the signing of highly-rated young defender Raphael Varane from French side Lens for a fee in the region of $14 million.
Varane played 23 matches for Lens last season, and despite the club being relegated from Ligue 1, he impressed with his displays.
The 18-year-old, who was also attracting the attention of England champions Manchester United, has signed a six-year deal with the Spanish giants.
Lens president Gervais Martel told reporters that Varane would have left the club, regardless of whether they escaped relegation.
"Even if Lens had stayed in Ligue 1, Raphael Varane would have left because he is a phenomenon," said Martel.
"He is going to play for Real Madrid under the leadership of Jose Mourinho who he has already met, and he has also met club advisor Zinedine Zidane.
"Raphael is an exceptional boy. I am proud that he is going to don the Real colors -- he has been pursued by Real for the past two months."
