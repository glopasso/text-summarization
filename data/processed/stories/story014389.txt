The son of Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal was arrested on a drug charge during a traffic stop in Santa Monica, California, on Tuesday morning, police said.
Redmond O'Neal, 26, was convicted on two drug offenses two years ago but was released a year ago from a Pasadena, California, sober living facility where he was undergoing court-ordered drug rehab.
On Tuesday, Santa Monica police searched O'Neal's car with his consent and found illegal narcotics, a department spokesman said.
No further information was available.
Ryan O'Neal, Redmond O'Neal and half-sister Tatum O'Neal sat together for an interview on June 25, 2010, the first anniversary of Fawcett's death. Redmond O'Neal was on a day pass from the rehab center so he could visit his mother's grave for the first time.
The three O'Neals were near tears as they spoke to CNN during a private gathering of friends and family at the Beverly Hills, California, headquarters of the Farrah Fawcett Foundation.
"Redmond is extremely well," Ryan O'Neal said. "He is recovering from a terrible disease. He seems to have cured himself. We are thrilled about that. And that's why he's here, because they let him."
"To show my face and let everybody know that I'm doing good, you know," Redmond O'Neal said. "You can't hide forever."
"And how handsome he is and how much he looks like Farrah," Tatum O'Neal said. "And how proud she would be and how lucky I am that I can at least be here, because he's so awesome. Oh, I'm going to cry."
