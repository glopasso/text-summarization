An Air Force pilot's remains were found in the Gulf of Mexico after the crash of an F-16 fighter jet Thursday, the military said.
The jet, based at Tyndall Air Force Base on the Florida Panhandle, was on a training mission over the Gulf when the Air Force lost contact with it about 9:15 a.m., the Air Force said.
The pilot's remains were recovered from the Gulf later in the day, the Air Force said Thursday night. It wasn't immediately clear whether the Air Force had found the aircraft; it earlier said that it was working on the assumption that the jet crashed into the water.
The pilot's name wasn't immediately released.
