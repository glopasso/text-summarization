Everyone has their favorite Girl Scout cookie: the popular Thin Mints, the coconuty caramel delight of the Samoas, the simple yet lovable Shortbreads. But for those who are eagerly running to their pantry to open a box of Lemon Chalet Cremes, a foul odor may dampen their cookie-eating experience.
Little Brownie Bakers of Louisville, Kentucky, one of two bakeries in the United States that make Girl Scout cookies, posted a statement on its Web site Friday saying it had received several complaints from customers who encountered a foul smell and taste in boxes of Lemon Chalet Cremes.
The bakery says it tested the cookies and determined that they are safe for consumers to eat. No sickness from the cookies has been reported. The company says that the odor is a result of oils improperly breaking down in the cookies that "are not up to our quality standards."
The Lemon Chalet Cremes were distributed in 24 states -- Alabama, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin -- and the District of Columbia.
The number of potentially stinky boxes totals 636,000, according to a spokesperson for Little Brownie Bakers.
The company is contacting each Girl Scout council that received a batch of the smelly cookies and says it will provide replacements.
The National Girl Scout offices were closed Friday because of the snowstorm in the Northeast. A recording on its 800 number redirected callers to Little Brownie Bakers for assistance.
