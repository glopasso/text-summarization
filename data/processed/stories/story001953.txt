Tom Cruise's neighbor had a rough night on Sunday.
Jason Sullivan, 41, allegedly tried to climb over the actor's fence when a security guard used a "Taser" device to stop him, according to police, who said Sullivan was intoxicated and arrested him on trespassing charges.
Police arrived at 9:35 p.m. to find the suspect "attempting to leave the location," Beverly Hills Police Lt. Lincoln Hoshino said on Monday.
Sullivan was arrested for trespassing and taken to a hospital by paramedics "for treatment due to the use of the 'Taser' device," he said.
"Sullivan lives at an adjacent property and was intoxicated at the time of the incident, and may have confused himself and entered the wrong property," Hoshino said.
Cruise and his family were not at home at the time of the incident, he said.
