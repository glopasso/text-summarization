Sometimes you get a good feeling about something.
That's what contestant Caitlin Burke, 26, said after her remarkable "Wheel of Fortune" solve that won her a Carribbean vacation.
With just one letter revealed -- "L" -- Burke correctly guessed the seven-word phrase: "I've got a good feeling about this."
Even Pat Sajak, the show's host, was shocked, according to video from Sony Pictures Studios.
"Wait a minute. Let me get over this first," he said, smiling. "Is it just me, or was that the most amazing solve we've ever had?"
Burke, who lives in New York, said she is a huge "Wheel of Fortune" fan and often impresses her family and friends by solving puzzles when they watch at home.
"I'm not bragging. There's a million and one things I'm not good at, but for some reason, I don't know, I've always just been really good at 'Wheel of Fortune,'" she said.
The show aired last week.
When asked what advice she could offer to aspiring contestants, Burke said practice. "Watch the show and think positive."
Appropriately, she added: "If you have a good feeling about something, just go for it!"
