Thirty minutes, each way, twice a day: That's how much a Haitian teenager walks to get something we tend to take for granted. Today, CNN Student News is traveling to an impoverished island nation and looking at what's changed five years after a catastrophic earthquake. We also cover headlines from Indonesia and France and look at how a British company is harnessing the power of kinetic energy.
