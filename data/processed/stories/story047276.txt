Ever wanted to know what really happened behind the scenes on "Saved by the Bell"?
You're about to find out.
According to BuzzFeed, Lifetime is producing "The Unauthorized Saved by the Bell Story," a TV movie scheduled to air on Labor Day, September 1.
The film's cast includes Dylan Everett as Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Julian Works as Mario Lopez and Tiera Skovbye as Elizabeth Berkley.
Some of the dirt hasn't been exposed before. In a 2009 memoir, Dustin Diamond (who played the nerdy Screech) offered up details on cast members' sex games, drug taking and abuse.
"Saved by the Bell" ran for four seasons in the early '90s and was followed by "Saved by the Bell: The College Years" and "Saved by the Bell: The New Class."
