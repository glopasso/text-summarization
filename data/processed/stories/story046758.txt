Michael J. Fox may star as an accomplished former news anchor and family man in NBC's Michael J. Fox Show, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have aspirations to be anything else â€” like a superhero. The new first look at the fall comedy provides glimpses at the show's offbeat humor, including a scene in which Mike wishes his medicine's side effects were cooler, like "anything Aquaman does."
The Michael J. Fox Show stars Fox as Mike Henry, a news anchor with Parkinson's returning to work, and "Breaking Bad"'s Betsy Brandt as his wife Annie Henry, relieved he's finally getting out of the house. The show also features "The Wire"'s Wendell Pierce as Henry's former boss and new addition Anne Heche as anchor/nemesis Susan Rodriguez-Jones.
