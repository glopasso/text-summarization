NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Fight police misconduct with a cell phone, the NAACP says.
The century-old civil rights organization has launched an online reporting system that lets users upload cell phone images of alleged police abuses.
The Rapid Report System also lets users send text messages and e-mails about alleged misconduct.
"We know that most of police officers around the nation are excellent public servants. But the few who violate people's rights are often not held accountable," said Benjamin Jealous, president and CEO of the NAACP. "Research has shown that there are many barriers to reporting incidents of police misconduct, including intimidation at police departments and a lack of trust in the integrity of the system, among other reasons. This breakdown leads to an absence of public safety and a deterioration of the quality of life in many communities of color."
The NAACP unveiled the online system Monday at its national convention in New York City. Users can post images from their cell phones or online.
Cell phone footage has repeatedly helped spotlight alleged police misconduct in recent years. The fatal shooting of an unarmed man in Oakland, California, on New Year's Day made headlines and spread across the Internet partly because of cell phone video.
The killing sparked large protests in Oakland and led to a murder charge against the transit officer.
