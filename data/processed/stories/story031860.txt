The casket holding Betty Ford's remains arrived late Wednesday afternoon in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where the final of two services will be held for the former first lady. The first service was held Tuesday in California.
The plane carrying her casket landed from California at an airport named after her husband, Gerald R. Ford International. The Ford Presidential Library and Museum is in Grand Rapids, where Ford was raised.
A welcome ceremony was scheduled for shortly after the casket's arrival, to be followed by a private prayer service at the Ford museum. A public viewing of the casket is scheduled from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Wednesday and again Thursday from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. at the presidential library, according to its website.
A funeral is scheduled Thursday at 2 p.m. at Grace Episcopal Church in Grand Rapids, the website said. Her remains will be returned to the museum's grounds for a private interment ceremony, the website said.
The first of the two services was held Tuesday in St. Margaret's Episcopal Church in Palm Desert, California, near where Ford set up a renowned alcohol and drug abuse treatment center, the Betty Ford Center, in Rancho Mirage, California.
Ford died Friday at age 93. Her husband, Gerald Ford, died in December 2006. He was also 93.
Ford will be interred alongside her husband.
