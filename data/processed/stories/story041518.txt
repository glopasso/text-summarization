Rafael Nadal claimed a seventh Barcelona Open title with a hard fought straight-set 7-6 (7-1) 7-5 victory over David Ferrer on Sunday.
The world No.2 completed another convincing display on the clay to notch up a 34th consecutive win in the tournament, seven days after winning his eighth successive title in Monte Carlo.
It was the fourth time the Spaniard has beaten Ferrer in the final at the Real Club de Tenis since 2008. But Nadal didn't have it all his own way.
The first set lasted 93 minutes with the 10-time grand slam winner having to save five set points in the 12th game before going on to take the tie-break comfortably.
"This was my hardest match since the start of the clay season. David always takes you to the limit. I was lucky when I saved break points. The odds were on my side," Nadal said afterwards.
Ferrer's resolve continued into the second as he came back from 3-1 down, breaking his compatriot's serve in the fifth and then the ninth game to edge 5-4 ahead.
But Nadal broke back immediately and followed it by holding his next service game to love. He carried the momentum into 12th and decisive game, closing out the match with the first of three match points.
"In the second set David played very close, but I had the luck at the end. I'm so happy and I feel sorry for him. I'm starting to feel my game well on the clay," he added.
The 25-year-old has now won 48 career titles in total and won 34 of 38 finals contested on the clay. Only Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer have ever got the better of him on the surface.
