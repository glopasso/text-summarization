Burberry, the 150-year-old British luxury brand most famous for its distinctive check pattern, has recently experienced a resurgence.
Christopher Bailey, Burberry's creative director, has been credited with the brand's resurgence.
The brand credits much of its new a la mode image to creative director Christopher Bailey.
The unassuming 37-year-old British designer has successfully reconnected Burberry with a trendy young audience -- using the likes of British super model Agyness Deyn, whom he has propelled to international stardom -- in ad campaigns.
But times are hard for luxury brands, with a recession that has turned many high-end consumers toward cheaper alternatives.
So how is Bailey handling the current economic climate?
With stylish new headquarters in the heart of London and the recent opening of a Burberry Children's wear store in the capital, it seems the brand has kept its wheels rolling.  Watch Burberry's creative director speak to CNN »
Bailey believes the new headquarters were an important extension of Burberry's image, telling CNN "the building is the brand beacon."
"It's so important that everyone lives and breathes the aesthetic of what Burberry is. We have to do what feels right for the company," Bailey added.
But that does not mean that Burberry is ignoring the recession. "It's all about the balance between functionality and emotion. You have to be instinctive about what's going on," said Bailey.
"We think about the world recession, but it helps us focus and make sure that the brand purity and integrity is there in everything we do.
"We've just opened our first [children's wear] store in London and the first signs are pretty wonderful."
But Bailey agrees that "there has been incredible excess in the last five to 10 years, so it's a good moment to re-balance."
So how will that translate to the catwalk? "The [clothes] will be investment pieces for the long-term. It's not just about fashion for a season."
