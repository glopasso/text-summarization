(EW.com) -- Spidey will cast his net across millions of TV screens during Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, but that's not where Thursday's televisual treats end.
Whether you're a certified dude, a lady with a taste for the finer things, a procedural junkie, a spy fan, or someone who understands "There's always money in the banana stand," we present a list of the all that's worth watching this Turkey Day.
Fun for the Whole Family
While you're slaving over your bird bright and early, give the kids a taste of what could await them if they don't toe the line with the Style Network's "Supernanny" marathon (6 a.m.-6 p.m.) Kids will also love back-to-back "Tom & Jerry" episodes on Cartoon Network (9 a.m.-7 p.m.), and teens will be occupied by MTV's double header of "Friendzone" (9 a.m.-1 p.m.) and "Ridiculousness" (3-7 p.m.).
Dudesgiving

Outdoorsy types can catch up with "Hillbilly Handfishin'" on Animal Planet (9 a.m.-5 p.m.), and weapons buffs have a choice between Discovery's two-series gun spectacular ("American Guns" from 9 a.m.-1 p.m. and "Sons of Guns" from 1 p.m.-6:30 p.m.) or G4â€²s "Bomb Patrol" (1-11 p.m.). For those with a truly unquenchable blood lust, Spike TV is kicking off the day at 10 a.m. with a "Steven Seagal marathon" spearheaded by the martial arts master's 1994 eco-actioner "On Deadly Ground."
Ladies' Choice
Where better to go to appreciate your own dysfunctional family than WE tv? The lady net is airing episodes of "Braxton Family Values" from 10 a.m.-1 a.m. Friday. Past noon, the time will be right to bust our your diamonds (and perhaps even your claws) with Bravo's "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" (noon-6 p.m.), not to mention pop open the champagne with Patsy and Edina of "Absolutely Fabulous" on LOGO (1-7 p.m.). Come nightfall, BET is catching you up with its newest original offering, "Reed Between the Lines" starting at 6 p.m.

Just Like Old Times
The end of the year always lends itself to a bit of nostalgia, so why not embrace the remembrance of things past with some old classics?
