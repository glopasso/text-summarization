The Cleveland Cavaliers on Thursday selected Kansas forward Andrew Wiggins with their third No. 1 overall pick in four years, hoping he can help take the team to the playoffs -- and out of the NBA draft lottery.
The Cavaliers' fortunes went downhill after the departure of LeBron James to the Miami Heat in 2010. But they've had flashes of hope -- led by guard Kyrie Irving, a product of Duke University -- and luck, as evidenced by beating the odds to get the draft's top pick for the second year in a row.
A native of Canada, Wiggins played one year at Kansas before opting to leave school and head to the NBA.
Duke's Jabari Parker, another freshman, was selected second overall by the Milwaukee Bucks.
