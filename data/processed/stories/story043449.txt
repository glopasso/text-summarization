Twelve people suffered minor injuries aboard a United Airlines flight when it encountered turbulence while flying over Louisiana on Wednesday, officials said.
"All 12 patients will be transported to area hospitals as a precautionary measure," according to Houston Fire Department spokesman Erica Duckworth, who said there were no serious injuries.
United Flight 1727 was flying from Tampa, Florida, to Houston with 151 people on board when the incident occurred, which prompted medical crews to meet the airplane when it landed at 7:30 a.m. CT (8:30 a.m. ET).
Images broadcast by CNN affiliate KTRK showed people being carted on stretchers, some in neck braces, away from the aircraft and toward waiting ambulances.
The National Transportation Safety Board says it is monitoring the situation and has not yet decided whether to investigate.
In years past, the board has made recommendations over pilot-induced turbulence, or aircraft oscillations caused by pilot decisions.
It's not clear if that occurred during Wednesday's incident.
