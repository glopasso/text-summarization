Snooki gives birth to a little bambina!
Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi delivered a baby girl early Friday morning. The former "Jersey Shore" star and fiancÃ©e Jionni LaValle welcomed Giovanna Marie LaValle, who weighed in at 6 pounds and 7 ounces.
Polizzi took to Twitter to announce the news, letting fans know Giovanna has a full head of black hair and is, quote, "perfect." This is the second child for the couple, who welcomed son Lorenzo in August 2012.
