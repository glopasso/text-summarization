In the wake of a botched execution, an Oklahoma court has granted a six-month stay for a man on death row.
Earlier, the state's attorney general had said his office would not object to the stay for Charles Warner.
An investigation into the death of Clayton Lockett last month continues. His lethal injection was stopped because of problems in administering the drugs. Officials say he later died of an apparent heart attack.
Witnesses described the man convulsing and writhing on the gurney, as well as struggling to speak, before officials blocked their view. It was the state's first time using a new, three-drug cocktail for an execution.
Warner had been scheduled to be put the death the same day as Lockett, but his execution was stayed.
"No one wants to see another prolonged, botched execution take place, so we are greatly relieved that the Court of Criminal Appeals stayed Charles Warner's scheduled execution, as both Mr. Warner and the State requested," Susanna Gattoni and Seth Day, attorneys for Warner, said in a statement.
"The extreme secrecy surrounding lethal injection that led to Mr. Lockett's agonizing death must be replaced with transparency in order to ensure that executions are legal and humane," they said.
Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office filed court documents Thursday that said he would not protest a 180-day stay to allow for the completion of the investigation.
Warner's execution, which had been set for May 13, is now scheduled for November 13.
Warner was convicted in 2003 for the first-degree rape and murder six years earlier of his then-girlfriend's 11-month-old daughter, Adrianna Waller.
