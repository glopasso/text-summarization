President Barack Obama called the next House Speaker -- Republican Rep. John Boehner of Ohio -- on Tuesday night after mid-term election results gave the GOP majority control of the chamber starting next year.
The White House said Obama also called the two top House Democrats -- outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and outgoing Majority Leader Steny Hoyer -- and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. While Republicans won a House majority, Democrats retained their Senate majority, though it will be much narrower than the current 59-41 advantage.
In his discussions with Boehner and McConnell, Obama told the two he was looking forward to working with them and Republicans "to find common ground, move the country forward and get things done for the American people," according to the White House statement.
Boehner's team issued a statement on the call from Obama, saying the two had a "brief but pleasant conversation."
"They discussed working together to focus on the top priorities of the American people, which Boehner has identified as creating jobs and cutting spending," the Boehner statement said.
"That's what they expect," Boehner was quoted as telling Obama in the call, according to the statement.
Earlier, Boehner told a victory rally that "it's clear tonight who the real winners are, and it's the American people."
"With their voices, the American people are demanding a new way forward in Washington," Boehner said, calling for conservative policies favored by the Tea Party such as cutting spending and reducing the size of government.
Before the election, Obama criticized Boehner for saying recently that "this is not a time for compromise" if Republicans win control of the House.
