(Mashable) -- Back in December, Facebook introduced its new profiles to the world. For the first month, users could choose between the new profile and the old profile. Starting today, all accounts will be upgraded to the new profile.
The new Facebook profiles feature a revamped interface, as well as easy access to photos of the user. The profiles also offer more details about work and education information, while letting users put friends into distinct categories, list various interests, and fill out a nifty new "about me" user summary.
We've already seen some fantastic examples of creative Facebook profile photo hacks that really showcase just how unique and inventive these profiles can be with a little work.
If you haven't already customized a new Facebook profile page for your own account, be sure to check Mashable's guide on the subject. Beverage maker Schweppes also has its own profile app that can aid in the customization process.
For those users who preferred the old interface, we can't really offer you any alternatives, but remember this is Facebook. Chances are, the company will revamp this interface again anyway.
