Two Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military in Gaza, Israeli and Palestinian officials said Wednesday.
An Israeli army unit opened fire on a man near the fence that separates Gaza from Israel late Tuesday night, according to an Israel Defense Forces spokesman. He said soldiers fired when the man came too close to the border fence which has in the past been a location of attacks against Israeli troops.
Medical officials in Gaza said they retrieved the body of a Palestinian 19-year-old at the site.
Separately, the Israeli air force carried out airstrikes on Tuesday against members of the Hamas military wing in central Gaza, killing one militant and injuring three others, according to a news release put out by Hamas.
The Israeli military said the attack came as a response to the firing of two long-range rockets fired from Gaza Monday night that hit the southern Israeli city of Beer Sheva. No one was injured in the rocket attack.
A total of 14 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza this month, according to the Israeli military,
The renewed violence comes as London based al-Hayat newspaper reported that Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal arrived in Cairo to discuss, among other things, a deal for the release of captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. Asked about the report, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak told Israeli radio "there was a grain of truth" in the rumors but he "preferred not to say anything because it doesn't help."
Gilad Shalit was captured by Gaza-based Palestinian militants in a cross-border raid in 2005 and has been held in captivity by Hamas ever since.
