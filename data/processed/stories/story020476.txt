The shoe company Nike has terminated its contract with Milwaukee Brewers outfielder Ryan Braun, the company said Friday, nearly two weeks after the five-time All Star was suspended for violating Major League Baseball's drug policy.
Nike did not provide a statement explaining its decision to drop Braun, the 2011 National League MVP.
Still, the decision isn't altogether surprising given Commissioner Bud Selig's announcement on July 22 that it was suspending Braun without pay for 65 days -- which worked out to the rest of the 2013 season.

The 29-year-old apologized and admitted wrongdoing in a statement, though neither he nor Selig went into specifics.
"I am not perfect," Braun said. "I realize now that I have made some mistakes. I am willing to accept the consequences of those actions.
He'd faced a 50-game suspension last fall after a drug test showed high levels of testosterone in his body. But that suspension was overturned after Braun successfully challenged the testing process.
The latest suspension has already hurt Braun's image, and his wallet. Before Nike took action, Kwik Trip severed ties with the 2007 rookie of the year, according to the convenience store chain spokesman John McHugh.
