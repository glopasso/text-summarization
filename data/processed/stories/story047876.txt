A father and son from Pennsylvania were charged this week with making threats to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, her family and lawyer.
The men, identified as Shawn Christy, 47, and Craig Christy, 22, were indicted by an Alaska grand jury Wednesday, according to court documents.
They were arrested in Pennsylvania on Thursday, CNN affiliate WFMZ reported.
The two are accused of calling Palin's attorney more than 400 times between August 1 and August 9, and leaving profanity-laced messages with threats of sexual assault on Palin, death threats and kidnappings, according to court documents.
"I'm going to ransom your f--- children. By the time I'm done you're going to be nobody," one of the messages allegedly said.
Palin and the attorney had a restraining order against both men. In some of the messages, the men allegedly mentioned that they knew they were violating the restraining order, court documents said.
