A woman who escaped from a California state prison 32 years ago was finally caught in Santa Barbara, police said Wednesday.
In 1979, Nancy Garces broke out of the women's prison in Chino, California, where she was serving a sentence in a credit-card forgery case, said Lt. Paul McCaffrey, spokesman for Santa Barbara police.
She had a pending warrant for her arrest since May 25, 1979, McCaffrey said.
Police received a tip that she would be arriving by train Tuesday in Santa Barbara at 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET), McCaffrey said.
"I can tell you she was very surprised," McCaffrey told CNN.
"I do believe that she regrets her decision to come to Santa Barbara," he added. "She's been on the run for 32 years, but the minute she arrived in Santa Barbara, we were ready to scoop her up."
Garces, 56, was traveling under her assumed name of Lydia Mendez of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and told authorities she even has kids under that name, McCaffrey said.
Police used the description of her age, height and weight to spot her as she got off the train, McCaffrey said.
"We made contact with her, and she gave us her assumed named, Lydia Mendez," McCaffrey said. "But we determined that she was in fact Nancy Garces, and we confronted her. Then she admitted who she was."
Garces was being held Wednesday in the county jail without bail.
