(EW.com) -- Let's be real for a second here. At this point, Lucasfilm is neither confirming nor denying that Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford are returning for "Star Wars: Episode VII."
But if director J.J. Abrams wants to bring back the original-trilogy trio, Hamill and Fisher are almost certainly on board. The question mark has always been Ford, who has spent most of his post-"Star Wars" career expressing mild-to-aggressive embarrassment about the franchise.
But Ford's feelings towards "Star Wars" have warmed in recent years. Perhaps Ford, who turned 70 last year, views "Episode VII" as a chance to burnish his reputation by returning to one of his most beloved characters. Also, money is nice.
Whatever the reason, even though the next film is still early in the development process, Ford gave a rather bold (for him) statement to Chicago's WGN-TV yesterday.

When asked by reporter Dean Richards if Ford is reuniting with his original castmates for the next movie, Ford responded: "I think it's almost true."

He added, "I'm looking forward to it," sounding like a man who was really looking forward to his next root canal. He ultimately hedged that it's "not in the bag yet, but I think it's happening."
