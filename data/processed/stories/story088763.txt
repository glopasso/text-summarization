Nadya Suleman, who gave birth to octuplets in January, will star in a reality television series about her family, a TV executive said.
Nadya Suleman will star in a "quasi-reality TV series," says a TV executive.
The Eyeworks executive, who asked not to be named, confirmed a Us magazine report that quoted Suleman's lawyer, Jeff Czech, saying a deal has been reached after months of negotiations.
The "quasi-reality TV series" would be "an arrangement whereby several events in the children's lives would be filmed in a documentary series," Czech told Us.
Eyeworks' British division will produce the show, the Eyeworks executive said.
"There is a story to be told" about the family, he said.
"They might be several shows aired during a year. There are all kinds of possibilities. It really depends on what the networks want," Czech was quoted as saying.
Though he said the show has not been named, Suleman has sought to trademark her media nickname -- Octomom -- for a TV show and a line of diapers.
Suleman has six other children. All 14 were conceived through in-vitro fertilization.
