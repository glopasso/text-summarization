Damon Harris, a former member of the Motown group The Temptations, has died at age 62, his family reported.
His eldest daughter, Erica Harris Outlaw, told CNN her father had been battling prostate cancer for the last 14 years.
"He was in great pain for the last several months," she said.
Harris died Monday, February 18, at Joseph Richey Hospice in Baltimore.
"He was the kind of dad where you wanted the best for him. We're going to really miss him," Outlaw said. "We miss him already."
Harris joined the Temptations at age 20 in 1971 and replaced Eddie Kendricks, one of the group's original lead singers, Billboard.com reported. Harris was with the group until 1975, and he was best known for singing tenor on the band's hit, "Papa was a Rolling Stone."
Harris also released a solo album, "Damon Harris: Silk" in the 1970s.
"I am saddened to hear about Damon," said Dennis Edwards, who was in the band with him. "He will be missed."
