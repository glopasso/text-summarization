Beach-bound travelers are keeping a close eye on the spread of oil along the Gulf Coast and weighing vacation decisions.
Oil has come ashore in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and cleanup is under way in some areas. Here are some of the latest updates from coastal destinations affected by the oil spill:
Gulf Islands National Seashore
All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites are open, according to the National Park Service website. The park service reports that crews found "very light occurrences of oil" on Horn and Petit Bois islands in Mississippi. Petit Bois island was cleaned up and has been free of oil as of Sunday, the site said.
