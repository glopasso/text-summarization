(CNN)Two people were shot Saturday at a nightclub party in Charlotte, North Carolina, featuring rappers T.I., Young Jeezy and Yo Gotti.
Both victims are expected to survive, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said in a news release. Police are searching for a suspect.
"Preliminary information and evidence gathered on the scene indicates that an unidentified suspect fired several shots from inside the club striking the two victims," Charlotte police said in a news release. "This is an ongoing, active investigation."
The shooting occurred around 7 p.m. at the Label nightclub, which is part of the popular N.C. Music Factory Complex. The nightclub was hosting a series of parties to celebrate the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament.
The club reopened a few hours later for a P. Diddy concert.
"We feel the security is adequate to avoid an additional incident, and we want to make sure that the patrons enjoy the tournament weekend," Label attorney Ken Harris told CNN affiliate WSOC. "There is always a very high level of security at Label."
