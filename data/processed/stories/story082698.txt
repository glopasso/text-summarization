Security forces rescued a U.S. citizen from the Taliban on Sunday during an operation in eastern Afghanistan, officials said.
Dr. Dilip Joseph was kidnapped Wednesday by insurgents in Kabul province, the NATO-led International Assistance Security Force said in statement.
He was believed to be in imminent danger of injury or death, which is why Gen. John Allen, commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, ordered the mission.
"Today's mission exemplifies our unwavering commitment to defeating the Taliban," Allen said in a statement. "I'm proud of the American and Afghan forces that planned, rehearsed and successfully conducted this operation. Thanks to them, Dr. Joseph will soon be rejoining his family and loved ones."
Further information on Joseph, including his hometown, was not immediately available.
