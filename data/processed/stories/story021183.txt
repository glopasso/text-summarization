The global economy is in the doldrums but the market for merchandise featuring the world's new mega-star shows no sign of tailing off.
Obama T-shirts and merchandise are flying off the shelves at the moment.
At the inauguration ceremony for U.S. President Barack Obama in Washington on Tuesday, thousands wore T-shirts, caps and watches featuring his image and even popping bottles of Barack bubbly.
Pens, pin badges and $5 cookies emblazoned with Obama's image are hugely popular in the U.S. while the Internet is helping to satisfy demand for other items around the world. Here are some pieces of merchandise available online:
Barack Obama action figure: 15-centimeter (6-inch) tall, electroplated statue in a gold suit could be yours for $39. However, the seller says that due to high demand the action figure is sold out.
Barack Obama thimble: If you're curious, then these are made out of porcelain so would be unsuitable for conventional sewing.
Obama face masks: These flew off the shelves when they first hit the markets in Japan in December and could be a hit at a fancy dress party.
Barack Obama earrings: To symbolize Barack Obama's African heritage, these earrings have a photograph of the president on a tiny map of the continent made from wood.
Replica inauguration tickets: The government printed 250,000 tickets for the inauguration in Washington, but some were reportedly sold online for $40,000. Pick up a framed replica then for just a few dollars. Have you purchased any Obama merchandise? Share your stories with us
Obama campaign poster: A set of six Obama campaign posters are on sale for $3,000.
New York Times inauguration newspaper could be yours for $10.50, plus $12.80 to post it from the U.S. of course.
"RUN DC" T-shirt: Was Obama in the 1980s hip-hop band? He certainly looks like it when dressed in geeky glasses, trilby hat and chain.
