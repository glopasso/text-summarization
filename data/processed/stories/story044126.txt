IN FOCUS: From importer to exporter
Unlike its Gulf neighbors, Jordan doesn't sit on a wealth of oil reserves. It actually imports about 90% of its energy needs. But as MME found out, all that could change as the Kingdom explores oil shale and looks to go from an energy importer to an energy exporter.
FACETIME: Leonardo Maugeri
According to Leonardo Maugeri, Harvard Business School fellow, by 2020 we will witness a world where there is too much oil on the market and there will be a steep drop in oil prices. In Maugeri's latest report, the former ENI Executive explains how high oil prices are fuelling the growth of unconventional oils such as oil shale and could prompt a plunge or even a collapse in oil prices. With oil prices continuing to hit $100 per barrel, MME caught up with Maugeri and asked him about his latest findings.
