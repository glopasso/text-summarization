It's that combination again: Justin Bieber, an automobile, and a mishap.
The singer-heartthrob was reportedly involved in an accident in Los Angeles on Monday night involving a pedestrian.
According to the Los Angeles Police Department, officers responded to a collision at 8800 Sunset Blvd., in the famed Sunset Strip area of the city. According to TMZ, as Bieber, 19, was leaving a local comedy club with rapper Lil Twist, his Ferrari was surrounded by paparazzi, one of whom got pinned between Bieber's car and another vehicle.
A preliminary investigation showed that no crime was involved, the LAPD's Lt. Craig Valenzuela said. He noted that there may have been initial concern that it was a hit-and-run, but preliminary investigations indicated it was not.
The pedestrian, who was unidentified, sustained some injuries but they were not life-threatening.
This isn't the first time the singer has had driving troubles. Last month police twice responded to reports that Bieber was speeding around his gated Southern California community. Last July, he was involved in a high-speed chase with paparazzi on an LA freeway. And in November he was cited for making an unsafe left turn and having an expired registration.
On New Year's Day, the Ferrari was involved in an incident in which a photographer was run over and killed while crossing a busy street after taking pictures of the vehicle. Bieber was not present at the time.
A representative for Bieber had no immediate comment on the most recent incident.
