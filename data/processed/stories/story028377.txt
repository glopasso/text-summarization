(PEOPLE.com) -- Never one to mince words, "The Talk" co-host Sharon Osbourne came right out and asked guest Melissa Gilbert when she knew her sister Sara Gilbert was gay.
While the question made Sara, 36, who recently started dating Linda Perry, squirm a bit, the audience laughed and cheered.
"You know what, I'll put it to you this way," said Melissa, 47, best known for her role on "Little House on the Prairie." "I took her to dinner when she was in her teens and I sat her down and I gave her this long speech about how much I love you and it doesn't matter and you're my darling and blah, blah, blah and you can tell me anything. And she looked and me and she said, 'I'm not gay.' And I was like, 'OK, whatever.'"
"Years later she called me and we were having a conversation about something and she said, 'You know, what if I just said that I'm gay,' and I went, 'And?' I mean I think always I kinda knew."
Sara, eager to change the subject, responded, "Don't we have a break coming up?"
