A Syrian airstrike in Aleppo has killed at least 15 people, including nine children, the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Saturday.
A single bomb landed in the mostly Kurdish district of Sheikh Maksoud, the group said.
Kurdish activists say the number of dead is expected to rise because there are many injured and in critical condition.
Amateur video purporting to show the site of the bombing appeared on the Internet shortly after the attack, providing a glimpse of a panicked scene.
Fires burned in a building and in a destroyed vehicle, the video showed.
People shouted as they ran from victim to victim; some who were not moving. Bystanders began to pick up the unmoving bodies and place them in the back of a pick-up truck, the video shows.
CNN cannot verify the authenticity of the video.
Syrian forces have been clashing for several days with Kurdish militias on the outskirts of the district, the Syrian Observatory said.
Another opposition group, the Local Coordination Committees of Syria, said 116 people were killed across the country Saturday, including 37 in Aleppo.
CNN cannot independently verify death tolls or other accounts of violence in Syria.
The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom.
That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's parliament in 2000 after his father died. The government responded with a brutal crackdown.
In February, the United Nations estimated that 70,000 people had been killed in the fighting.
