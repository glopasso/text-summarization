(CNN)The police may have found the missing dress.
You know, the white custom Calvin Klein gown that adorned actress Lupita Nyong'o when she attended Sunday's Academy Awards.
The one encrusted with 6,000 white Akoya pearls that Fortune estimated was worth $150,000.
The dress that Nyong'o, who won a best supporting actress Oscar last year for "Twelve Years a Slave," reported stolen Wednesday from her room in the swanky London Hotel off Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood.
Yes, that old thing.
The L.A. Sheriff's Department got a tip Friday and looked in an abandoned bathroom on the second floor of the same London Hotel, the department said in a press release.
The tip, they said, came from "a media representative" who got a call from an anonymous caller.
The investigators went to the hotel and found a black garment bag underneath the bathroom counter.
Inside the bag they found a white dress "resembling the one" worn by Nyong'o.
Sounds like it would be hard to mistake the dress, but the sheriff's department is working with the dress owners to find out if it's the real thing.
Calvin Klein also expressed guarded enthusiasm over the dress's potential return.
"All of us at Calvin Klein are thrilled to know that the dress has potentially been located. This was an amazing collaboration between the brand and Lupita and the dress looked truly exquisite on her," Francisco Costa, Women's Creative Director of Calvin Klein Collection, said in a press release.
"Once it's returned to us, we will be able to have the dress restored and archived, as it now represents an important moment for the brand."
