A United Airlines plane made an emergency landing in Omaha on Wednesday night after the crew discovered a fuel leak, an airport spokesman said.
Flight 788 was en route from San Francisco to Boston when it was forced to divert to Eppley Airfield with a fuel leak in the right engine, said Joe Rotterdam, an operation supervisor for the airport.
The aircraft landed safely at 8:20 p.m. CT.
United was bringing in another plane to fly the passengers to Boston, Rotterdam said.
