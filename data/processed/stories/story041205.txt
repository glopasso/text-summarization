A 2-year-old boy who authorities say was abducted by a stranger Saturday following a home invasion robbery that ended in a double homicide has been found, police in Virginia said.
The suspect fled the scene, stealing a vehicle that was idling near the home, authorities said. The toddler, identified as Kaiden Gage Burnside, was inside the vehicle, they said.
"The car and the child have been recovered," said Lt. Ronnie Armstead, a spokesman for the Richmond Police Department.
The identities of the shooting victims were not released and it was not immediately known what relation, if any, they had to the missing boy.
The suspect has no relation to the child, Armstead said.
Authorities have put together the events of the alleged home invasion and shooting through the statements of a witness who was inside the house at the time of the shooting, Armstead said. That witness was not related to the suspect nor man and woman who were killed, he said.
Police have issued an arrest warrant for Jamal Clemons, 27, on suspicion of abduction, robbery, robbery with a firearm, using a firearm in the commission of a felony and a felon being in possession of a firearm, Armstead said.
