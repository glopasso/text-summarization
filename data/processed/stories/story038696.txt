Opera star Placido Domingo's next two performances have been canceled while the singer is treated for a serious blood clot in his lung, his publicist said Tuesday.
Domingo, 72, entered a hospital in his hometown of Madrid, Spain, Monday "where he is being successfully treated for a pulmonary embolism resulting from a deep vein thrombosis," according to a statement released by publicist Nancy Seltzer.
"Maestro Domingo is expected to make a full recovery," Seltzer said.
Blood clots rare, experts say
His doctor ordered the famed tenor to rest for three or four weeks, which means he won't make it to performances scheduled for next week in Madrid, she said.
"His exact return to his performing engagements remains subject to how fast he can heal and regain his characteristic strength," the statement said.
