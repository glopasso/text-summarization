Rangers restored their four-point lead over Celtic despite conceding the fastest goal in Scottish Premier League history on Sunday.
The Glasgow side went behind after only 12.4 seconds as Hibernian striker Anthony Stokes surpassed the previous mark set by Saulius Mikoliunas for Edinburgh rivals Hearts back in 2006, but bounced back to register a 4-1 away victory.
Scotland striker Kenny Miller scored in each half, while goals from fellow frontmen Kris Boyd and Nacho Novo ensured that third-placed Hibs' unbeaten run of 13 league games came to an end.
Celtic had closed the gap to one point after beating Hamilton Academicals 2-0 on Saturday.
Rangers, meanwhile, expect to have Madjid Bougherra available for Wednesday's home clash with fourth-placed Dundee United, but the Algeria defender will leave for African Nations Cup duty in Angola before next Sunday's Old Firm derby showdown with Celtic.
"That's the way it's looking at the present moment," manager Walter Smith said.
Smith will also be without United States winger DaMarcus Beasley for the next few weeks after he suffered an injury in training before the Hibs game.
"He has a tear in his thigh. I'm not sure how long that will keep him out -- two or three weeks maybe," Smith said.
"It's disappointing in the sense that he is just back in the team and doing exceptionally well, so it was disappointing it happened."
However, Beasley's international teammate Maurice Edu boosted his chances of playing at next year's World Cup finals in South Africa after making his first appearance this season.
The midfielder, who suffered a serious knee injury in the final SPL game of last season, came off the substitutes' bench for the final 15 minutes at Easter Road.
