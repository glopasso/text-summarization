Fox News anchor Gregg Jarrett spent a dozen hours in jail after being arrested on charges of interfering with a police officer at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, officials said.
Jarrett, 59, was "belligerent and uncooperative" with police officers who responded to a report Wednesday that he was drunk at an airport bar, according to airport spokesman Patrick Hogan.
"He is dealing with serious personal issues at this time," a Fox News spokeswoman said in an e-mail to CNN on Thursday.
Jarrett was released from the Hennepin County Jail on a $300 bond early Thursday, according to jail records found online. He has a June 6 court date on a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of the legal process and interfering with a peace officer, the record said.
TVNewser, a website that covers the television news industry, reported on May 12 that Jarrett was taking time off from his weekend anchor duties on Fox, quoting the network as saying he had "requested time off for personal reasons and Fox obliged."
Jarrett joined Fox News 12 years ago and has most recently co-anchored on weekend shows.
"A date at which Gregg might return to air has yet to be determined," the Fox News statement to CNN said.
