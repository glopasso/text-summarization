As wise people say: Don't ask questions if you don't want to know the answer.
Robin Thicke and the team at VH1 learned that lesson the hard way Tuesday when the hashtag #AskThicke, created for a Twitter Q&A session with the singer, backfired in a big way.
Users flooded the micro blogging site with biting criticisms of Thicke, his music, and his treatment of women, particularly his wife.
The couple, married since 2005, decided to separate in February, and since then singer has been trying to win her back with his performances.
"Do you think Tim Howard can save your marriage?" tweeted @PlaidAndDots, referring to the goalie for the U.S. team at the World Cup.
"Y'all knew that #AskThicke was going 2 be a disaster. Twitter has no chill and once again PR people are getting celebrities clowned," tweeted @LisaBolekaja.
The Q&A went forward, despite the backlash, with Thicke seeming to address the controversy at one point.
"I'm a big boy. I can handle it," he tweeted during the session with VH1.
A representative for the "Blurred Lines" singer declined to comment Tuesday. CNN reached out to VH1 but did not immediately hear back.
Meanwhile, the hate fest continued online.
"On a scale of 1 - Robin Thicke, how creepy is your next single going to be?" tweeted @emmaensign. "Any general tips for women trying to avoid men like you?"
"Robin could use a good #AskThicke in," tweeted @Doolies67.
