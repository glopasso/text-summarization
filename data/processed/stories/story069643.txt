(Mashable) -- UPDATE 11:30 a.m. ET: Verizon has posted a Twitter message saying, "4G LTE up and running. Thank you for your patience."
Verizon's LTE network has been having some major issues in the past 24 hours, and the company has issued an official statement about the problem, promising a fix as soon as possible.
Luckily, while the 4G portion of Verizon's data communication has been unavailable, the 3G network is working. According to Verizon, 4G LTE Smartphones should still be able to make calls, but customers are currently unable to activate any 4G LTE devices.

Meanwhile, Engadget reports that Verizon has postponed the launch of Samsung Droid Charge, which is hardly surprising as it is also an LTE device.
