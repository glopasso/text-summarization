Sebastian Vettel made Formula One history as he won the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to clinch the title.
The 23-year-old German becomes the youngest champion in the sport's history and his triumph completes the double for Red Bull who won the constructors' category.
Fernando Alonso went into the final round with an eight-point lead in the standings ahead of Vettel's teammate Mark Webber of Australia, but they finished seventh and eighth respectively to see their title hopes ended.
Vettel was winning his fifth race of the season and he dominated from pole position to hold off 2008 champion Lewis Hamilton whose McLaren teammate Jenson Button took third.
