LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Oscar-nominated director John Singleton accidentally struck and killed a pedestrian, a Los Angeles police spokesman said late Friday.
John Singleton directed "Rosewood," "Baby Boy," "Shaft"  and "Four Brothers" after "Boyz N the Hood."
Constance Russell, 57, of Los Angeles, died at a hospital a few hours after the accident Thursday evening, Los Angeles Police Officer Jason Lee said. Russell was not using a crosswalk when she stepped in front of Singleton's car, Lee said.
According to a preliminary police investigation, Singleton was not under the influence of drugs, alcohol or any other substance and was permitted to leave after being questioned.
However, Lee said because the victim was killed, the case has been turned over to the district attorney's office for review.
Singleton, 39, earned two Academy Award nominations for his 1991 debut film "Boyz N the Hood." That film also won him an MTV Movie Award as best new filmmaker.
Other films he has directed include "Rosewood," "Baby Boy," "Shaft" and "Four Brothers." E-mail to a friend
