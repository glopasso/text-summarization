Demonstrators said police were shooting into the crowd with rubber bullets; the police would not comment.
"We have you surrounded," some demonstrators sang. "We have no fear."
At one point, Spanish police charged demonstrators with batons to prevent them from approaching the parliament, which was in session.
Spain is facing an economic crisis with unemployment near 25%, and the protesters accused the government and the opposition alike of trying to solve the country's financial woes on the backs of the people.
Video from the scene showed police charging groups of protesters with their clubs, but such clashes were isolated.
Protesters' demands include a reduction in the size of the government, state-run broadcaster TVE reported.
Some protesters threw bottles and rocks at the police officers, who fought back, TVE reported.
