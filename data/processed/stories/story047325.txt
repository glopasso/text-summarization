Charges are likely to be reduced against the bikers who were arrested and charged in connection with the beating of an SUV driver on a Manhattan street in September, a Manhattan District Attorney spokeswoman told CNN.
Prosecutors said Friday that charges would likely be reduced on the next court date because of the lack of serious physical injury, the spokeswoman said.
The reduced felony holds a penalty of five to 15 years -- the original charge holds a penalty of eight to 25 years, the spokeswoman said.
Footage of the incident recorded from another biker's helmet camera went viral after it was posted online.
Authorities say SUV driver Alexander Lien was chased by bikers after he initially bumped one during a biker rally. When his Range Rover was surrounded by several bikers, Lien called 911, told police he feared for his life and drove off, running over bikers and critically injuring one.
Lien's wife and 2-year-old daughter were in the vehicle with him. The chase that followed ended in traffic. Police say Lien's windows were smashed, he was dragged out of the SUV and beaten. He was treated and released from a hospital. He has not been charged.
Eleven people were indicted in the attack. The next court appearances are scheduled for February 27 and 28.
