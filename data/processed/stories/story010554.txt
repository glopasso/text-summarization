Security forces rescued two tourists Saturday, just one day after they were kidnapped in a remote region of northeast Ecuador, the Interior Ministry said.
The Interior and Environment Ministries offered slightly different accounts of what happened.
According to both, the tourists were part of a group that was attacked Friday. Others in the group were let go.
The attack occurred either inside or near the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve, which is located in the northeast province of Sucumbios near the border with Colombia.
Including the two who were kidnapped, the tourist group totaled seven people, according to the Interior Ministry. The Environment Ministry, however, said that just five tourists -- including the two who were taken -- were attacked.
The Environment Ministry identified those kidnapped as an Australian woman, 32, and a 23-year-old woman from England.
According to reports from people in the area, the attack was carried out by members of a group that calls itself the "Black Eagles," the Environment Ministry said.
The Interior Ministry reported only that it was likely a Colombian group that took the tourists. Authorities in both countries worked the case.
