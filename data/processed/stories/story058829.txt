Tiger Woods won the World Golf Championship tournament at Doral's Blue Monster course in Florida on Sunday, boosting his comeback just weeks before next month's Masters.
Woods, 37, finished Sunday's final round two strokes ahead of runner-up Steve Stricker despite two bogeys in his last three holes.
Woods' 76th PGA tour win puts him closer to regaining the No. 1 ranking in the world, a status now held by Northern Ireland golfer Rory McIlroy, 23, who finished the tournament seven strokes behind Woods and tied for eighth place.
It is Woods' second tournament win of the young season, adding to the Farmers Insurance Open title he won in January. The hot start is reminiscent of a stretch from 2005 to 2007 when Woods won 21 tournaments and five majors.
Woods credits his physical condition and his work with swing coach Sean Foley. "I'm finally healthy and that has a lot to do with it," he said Saturday.
The major overhaul to his technique is complete, he said. "We are just making fine tunes. Each and every day you have little bitty adjustments here and there," he told reporters.
