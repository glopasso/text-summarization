Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet claimed victory in his bid for a full term Wednesday, but his Republican opponent has yet to concede the race.
"I am humbled by your support," the Democratic incumbent told supporters in Denver. "I won't let you down."
Bennet was appointed in 2009 to replace Ken Salazar, now the Obama administration's interior secretary, and was seeking a full six-year term this year. With 90 percent of the vote, he led Republican challenger Ken Buck by about 6,400 votes out of nearly 1.6 million cast.
Bennet fended off a primary challenge from former House Speaker Andrew Romanoff in August and was a top GOP target this year.
Buck, a former Weld County district attorney who garnered an upset primary win with Tea Party support, had not yet conceded the race. Before Bennet's announcement, his campaign was still reviewing in what counties still had returns outstanding, and the number of provisional ballots remaining.
"We will have further comment later today," the campaign said.
