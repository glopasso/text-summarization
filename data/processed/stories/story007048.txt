Four people were killed Wednesday in a two-vehicle crash on U.S. Highway 63 near Bay, Arkansas, said Craighead County Deputy Coroner Kurt Beeson.
Video from the scene showed the minibus resting on its roof alongside the road.
The incident involved a Chrysler PT Cruiser and a minibus that Beeson said was operated by Focus Incorporated, which is aimed at helping disabled people.
Video showed the highway littered with debris from the crash. The minibus was resting on its roof in a ditch beside the road. The mangled and nearly unrecognizable burgundy PT Cruiser came to rest on the other side of the road.
The footage showed at least one body being put in the back of an ambulance. Authorities held up sheets to shield victims from the overhead helicopter from CNN affiliate WMC.
Northbound lanes of U.S. 63 were closed.
Beeson said preliminary information indicates that the driver of the PT Cruiser was heading the wrong way on the highway or crossed into the wrong lane.
