(EW.com) -- After personal photos of Sam & Cat star Jennette McCurdy leaked online, rumors surfaced that Nickelodeon was canceling the show â€” a hit spinoff that's drawn big ratings for the kid-centric channel. (An hourlong special that reunited various characters from Sam & Cat's precedessors, Victorious and iCarly, was watched by an audience of 4.8 million in January.)
Nickelodeon, however, says these whispers aren't true. According to the network, Sam & Cat is simply taking a scheduled production hiatus.
"We are wrapping up what was an unusually long production cycle of Sam & Cat, and everyone is understandably tired," a Nickelodeon rep said in a statement. (Sam & Cat's mammoth first season numbers 40 full episodes.) "We are going into our production hiatus next week which will give everyone on the show a much-needed rest."
The next episode of Sam & Cat is scheduled to air April 12 on Nickelodeon.
