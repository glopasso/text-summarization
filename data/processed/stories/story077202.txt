"Top Chef" host Padma Lakshmi is pregnant with her first child, her publicist confirmed to CNN on Thursday.
Padma Lakshmi will be eating for two on Bravo's "Top Chef."
Lakshmi, 39, has not identified the father. Her representative told US Weekly that the television personality conceived after a long battle with endometriosis.
"Model, author, and Emmy-nominated Padma Lakshmi confirms that she is carrying her first child after years of struggling with endometriosis, a cause for which she has co-founded the Endometriosis Foundation of America," the representative told the magazine.
Endometriosis is a medical condition where the uterus' lining grows in other areas of the body. The often painful condition can cause women to have irregular bleeding and possible infertility.
Lakshmi's publicist also told US Weekly that "As a result of her condition, this pregnancy has been referred to by her physician as nothing short of a medical miracle, and due to its delicate nature, we ask/implore the press to respect Ms. Lakshmi's privacy at this time."
Lakshmi is the ex-wife of famed author Salman Rushdie. She has hosted Bravo's hit show "Top Chef" since its second season and is herself a noted cookbook author.
