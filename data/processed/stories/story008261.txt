A small plane crashed Friday near an Ohio-area high school during a football scrimmage.
Spectators at a high school football scrimmage watch as a plane goes down Friday in Ohio.
Spectators at a practice game at Harrison High School watched from the bleachers as the plane went down at 8:08 p.m. ET, said police officer Jennifer Coyle, who witnessed the incident.
Two people on the plane died at the crash scene, authorities said.
According to CNN affiliate WLWT, witnesses said the plane was heading toward the football field when it suddenly dropped, crashing in a gravel pit near the school.
"It looked like he was going straight for the boys on the field, but then just did a straight nosedive," Mindy Brinson told WLWT.
It is not yet known what caused the plane to crash. Harrison is in the southwest corner of Ohio.
