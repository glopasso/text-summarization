A man with a pistol killed one person and wounded three others at a cafe in the Dutch city of Rotterdam on Saturday morning, a police spokesman said.
Police officers stand next to the body of the victim killed by the cafe gunman in Rotterdam.
Patrons at the cafe managed to capture the shooter, a 45-year-old man, and hold him until police arrived, Rotterdam Police spokesman Gerde Jung told CNN.
Police arrested the man and recovered his weapon, Jung said.
The shooting was probably the the result of a quarrel the man had earlier, but details of that argument were unclear, Jung said.
All of the victims were male, he said.
