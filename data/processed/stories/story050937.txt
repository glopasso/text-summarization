Unbelievable. That's how a police captain described the case.
A 39-year-old woman in Utah is in custody, accused of murder, after authorities found the remains of seven infants at a home where she used to live.
"During the course of the investigation, information was obtained that over a 10-year period a 39-year-old female gave birth to the infants and then killed them. The female was booked into the Utah County Jail on six counts of murder," Pleasant Grove, Utah, police said in a statement.
Capt. Michael Roberts identified the woman as Megan Huntsman. It was not immediately clear why she faces six, not seven, counts of murder.
The bodies were found at a home where Huntsman had lived until 2011, said Roberts, adding that the residence is currently occupied by family members of her estranged husband.
People were cleaning out the garage, saw a suspicious bag, opened it and found the remains of the first infant, he said.
"A search warrant was obtained for the residence and during the execution of the warrant, officers discovered six additional infant bodies. Each infant was found packaged in separate containers," the police statement read.
According to Roberts, a second search warrant was issued for Huntsman's current home, but nothing of interest was found there. She is expected to appear in court either Monday or Tuesday, he said.
