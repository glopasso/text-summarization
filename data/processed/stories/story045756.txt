(EW.com) -- While the Broadway-bound "Aladdin" is going through a whole new world of previews up in Toronto, Disney has found its next theatrical endeavor: the 1987 adventure comedy "The Princess Bride."
Disney Theatrical Productions announced Monday that William Goldman's 1973 novel and subsequent 1987 film adaptation would be the next in line for development by Disney's stage arm.

Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn (who worked closely on the film) shepherded the deal, which allows the piece to enter the arduous process of development for the stage.
"The Princess Bride" is a cult-favorite fairy tale rom-com about the love story between a country girl and a farm boy (or is he a pirate?), as told by a grandfather to his sick grandson. The original film starred Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Fred Savage, Robin Wright, Peter Falk, Billy Crystal, Carol Kane and Andre the Giant.

Interestingly enough, Disney did not announce what form the "Princess Bride" stage production will take â€” as of this writing, it's not necessarily a play but not necessarily a musical, either.
(A previously attempted musical version from "The Light in the Piazza" composer Adam Guettel fizzled out in 2007.)
It's also up in the air who the creative team will be or what the timetable for the project will entail. Hopefully, we'll see this beloved classic translated to the stage in time for the 2023 Tony Awards!
