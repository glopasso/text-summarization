Amid a report she has defected, the daughter of Cuba's vice president has been living with relatives in Tampa, Florida, for nearly two weeks, an individual close to her told CNN on Tuesday.
Glenda Murillo, daughter of Vice President Marino Murillo, was on her way Tuesday to visit her boyfriend in Hialeah, Florida, and could not be reached for comment, the individual close to her said by telephone.
Asked by CNN to confirm a published report that Murillo had defected, the individual responded, "You already know that."
Murillo defected this month, reported El Nuevo Herald in Miami, citing sources.
According to the newspaper, Glenda Murillo crossed the Mexico border at Laredo, Texas, and was paroled as provided for by a policy that allows Cubans who set foot on U.S. land to stay.
The younger Murillo never received a U.S. visa to visit relatives or study in the United States, according to El Nuevo Herald.
Marino Murillo, 51, is vice president of the Council of Ministers and a member of the Cuban State Council. In 2011, he was put in charge of implementing economic reforms.
Murillo told reporters in March that his country's political system is "sustainable" and that it will not change.
Asked late Tuesday to comment, a U.S. State Department spokesperson said, "U.S. laws on confidentiality do not permit me to disclose the specifics about individual visa and parole cases, or requests for asylum."
