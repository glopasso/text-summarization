(EW) -- With summer coming to a close, Oscar season is officially in full swing.
James Franco, fresh from his Comedy Central Roast, kicks off the first of the "For Your Consideration" ads that appeal to awards-show voters. In a bid to secure a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his role as Alien in "Spring Breakers," the film's distributor, A24, launched a campaign called "Consider This S***," The Hollywood Reporter first reported.
James Franco's Comedy Central roast: The 26 best lines
In "Spring Breakers," directed by Harmony Korine, Franco plays a kind of Spring Break Jesus, in the form of a rapper/hustler/predator of college girls â€” replete with chest-length cornrows, a grill and a psycho-Southern accent.
Though not considered a leading contender for the category, a spokesperson for A24 films told The Hollywood Reporter, "James Franco has created a character so indelible it deserves recognition. We are excited to be able to support it with a campaign and know the impact of Alien will last far past this awards season."
In the ad, Franco, dressed to the Florida-swag hilt as Alien, is book-ended by two out of four of his college-age, perma-bikini-clad protÃ©gÃ©s: Brit (Ashley Benson) and Candy (Vanessa Hudgens). Franco is leaning against a white car and proudly double-fisting Oscar statuettes.
Review: 'Spring Breakers'
Franco was last nominated for an Oscar at the 2011 show for his performance as mountain climber Aron Ralston in "127 Hours."
Not a member of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences? Not to worry. You can lend your support by memorizing his "Look at my s***" speech, or basking in the pink afterglow of the bizarrely entrancing cast cover of Britney Spears' "Everytime" in this fan video.
