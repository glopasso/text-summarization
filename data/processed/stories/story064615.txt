Sebastian Vettel sealed his ninth win of the 2011 Formula One season in Singapore on Sunday, and the Red Bull driver is now just one point away from becoming the sport's youngest double world champion.
The German extended his lead at the top of the drivers' standings to 124 points, with McLaren's Jenson Button moving into second position after finishing runner-up at the Marina Bay circuit.
The 24-year-old can now wrap up the world championship at the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka on October 9, which is race 15 of 19.
Ferrari's Fernando Alonso dropped one position into third and the Spaniard is now only two points clear of Vettel's teammate Mark Webber in fourth, after the Australian claimed the final podium spot in Singapore.
Vettel wins in Singapore but title must wait
Button's McLaren colleague and fellow Briton Lewis Hamilton lost ground on those above him after a disappointing fifth-place finish, the same position he occupies in the world championship.
In the race for the constructors' title, Red Bull continued to assert their dominance by moving 138 points clear at the top of the pile.
McLaren consolidated their position in second, with Ferrari a further 85 points back in third position.
