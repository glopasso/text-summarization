For two immigration reform activists, heckling the President of the United States landed the pair an exclusive meeting.
Juan Belman and Mizraim Belman got an unexpected response from President Barack Obama when they stood up and shouted while Obama was lamenting congressional inaction on immigration reform.
"I'm on your side, man. Sit down, guys -- we'll talk about it later. I promise," Obama said, even telling security personnel not to escort the two out.
And the President apparently made good on his promise, meeting with the two brothers after the speech. The White House confirmed the meeting but wouldn't provide details.
The Austin American-Statesman reported that the pair are undocumented and their mother could face deportation.
But a friend of the brothers' had an important question for them on Twitter: "Did you take a selfie though?"
"No selfie," @juanbelman tweeted back. "The secret service was watching our every move."
Belman added that the meeting "went by real quick."
The brothers were nervous about interrupting Obama and were not sure if they would go through with their plan, the American-Statesman reported, but knew this was a unique opportunity.
"Our families can't wait any more," Mizraim Belman, a 16-year-old high school student, told the newspaper.
Mizraim's older brother said Obama promised action on immigration reform.
"He said he was going to act and keep his word," Juan Bellman, a junior at the University of Texas, told the paper. "It is up to us to keep reminding."
