It was either a very restless or restful night of sleep for someone who bought a Powerball ticket in Northern California.
Restless knowing their life had changed forever. Or restful knowing they had a boatload of cash coming their way.
The California Lottery announced late Wednesday that one winning ticket was sold for the $425 million jackpot.
The winning numbers were 17, 49, 54, 35, 1.  The Powerball number was 34.
The golden ticket was sold at Dixon Landing Chevron in Milpitas, a Bay Area town just north of San Jose. The business will reap its own $1 million for its part in making its customer rich.
One of the co-owners doesn't even know he's about to reap such a reward or that his store has been inundated with media and onlookers. Kulwinder Singh was on a plane to India when the news came the winning combo came from one of his stores, his son and co-owner Parmeet Singh said.
"I think it will mean a lot," Parmeet Singh told CNN. "From an investment point of view, it's just a great opportunity."
The big victor has yet to come forward. Singh hopes he or she happens to one of the "regulars" staffers know on a first-name basis, though he's happy for whomever is about to cash in.
"There are a lot of deserving people," he added. "I'm super excited to find out. I really want to know."
Some customers outside the Chevron were abuzz.
"My co-worker just called me right now.  'Did you buy your ticket at the Chevron?'  I was like, no  She says, 'Oh my God, someone just hit it there.'  Crazy, could have been me," Jocelyne Garcia told CNN affiliate KPIX.
Wednesday's jackpot ranks as the sixth largest in U.S. history.
The largest was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split by three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland.
The Powerball game is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510.
