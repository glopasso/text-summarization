Skydance, which is producing the film with Paramount, tweeted the news earlier Friday, and the studio followed with confirmation.
"We don't have a TARDIS, but we do have a Time Lord: we're pleased to welcome Matt Smith to the cast of #Terminator," the tweet read.

Smith will play a new character with a strong connection to anti-robot resistance fighter John Connor, now played by "Zero Dark Thirty's" Jason Clarke.
"Game of Thrones'" Emilia Clarke plays Sarah Connor and Jai Courtney has been cast as Kyle Reese. Arnold Schwarzenegger is slated to be back â€” but, of course â€” joining newcomers J.K. Simmons, Dayo Okeniyi, and Byung Hun Lee.
Alan Taylor, who helmed the most recent "Thor" sequel, is directing the film, which is rumored to be titled "Terminator: Genesis." Paramount has set a release date of July 1, 2015.
