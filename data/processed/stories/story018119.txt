"Talladega Nights" actor Luke Bigham, 20, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence harassment after a fight between him and his mother, Lorrie Crumley, on July 8.
According to Lt. Jeff Bridges of Trussville Police Department, Bigham "pushed his mother into the stairs" in her Alabama home. When police arrived at the scene, Crumley, 42, said she was in pain from the attack, but did not wish to get medical attention.
This is not Bigham's first brush with the law. In June, he was arrested on charges of reckless driving. Accused of driving at speeds of over 80 mph in a 35 mph zone, Bigham was in an accident, injuring himself and two others. In that case, Bigham turned himself in to Trussville City Jail, where he was later released on a $1,000 bond.
Bigham is best known for his role as the 10-year-old version of Will Ferrell's character, "Ricky Bobby," in the 2006 comedy "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby." Bigham's most recent work was on HBO comedy "Eastbound & Down" in 2009.
Bigham's court date is scheduled July 11 if he has not yet been released on a bond set at $1,000 for the misdemeanor.
