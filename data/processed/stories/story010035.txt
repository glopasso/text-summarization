Two Gulf States are putting more than pride on the line.
There's also dessert and a condiment.
Texas Gov. Rick Perry has wagered a case of barbecue sauce.
Florida Gov. Rick Scott is putting up a key lime pie.
Each is betting that their home team will win the best-of-seven NBA Finals, whose opener Tuesday night pits the Dallas Mavericks against the Miami Heat. The series is a rematch of the 2006 NBA finals, which the Heat won in six games.
"LeBron (James) may have taken his talents to South Beach, but there's no way he'll be taking the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy there this season," Perry of Texas said in a statement. "The Mavericks' combination of teamwork and experience will overwhelm Miami's raw star power, and at the end of the series, folks in Texas will be celebrating yet another NBA championship here in the Lone Star State."
Texas' two other NBA franchises, the San Antonio Spurs and the Houston Rockets, have won a combined six NBA titles.
The Florida governor says his team has the hotter hand.
"It might be warm in Texas, but there is no way the Dallas Mavericks will be able to withstand the Heat," Scott said. "Not even Dirk Nowitzki will be able to stop Miami from bringing home another NBA title."
No word yet on which state can serve up the best main course.
