New York (CNN)New York City's longest recorded homicide-free streak ended late Friday night, when a 28-year-old man was shot multiple times just before midnight.
Eric Roman was transported to a nearby hospital in critical condition with gunshot wounds to his head, hand and leg and died Saturday, according to the New York Police Department.
New York City had gone 12 days without a homicide, its longest stretch on modern record, police said Monday.
The last reported homicide was February 1, Super Bowl Sunday, in Upper Manhattan, police said.
That day, police responded to a 911 call about multiple shots being fired and found five individuals with gunshot wounds, the NYPD said. One of those five, Graham Shadale, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene.
Police have not yet made arrests in either case and both investigations are ongoing, officials said.
The streak has been the longest since the New York Police Department began recording statistics with a computerized program called Compstat in 1994, a police representative said.
Police Commissioner Bill Bratton hushed talk of the streak Friday on "CBS This Morning."
"Shh ... we don't want to jinx it," Bratton told host Charlie Rose. "We're into our 12th day now, Charlie. Eleven is a record and let's keep it going."
Despite the record-breaking streak, there has been an uptick in shooting incidents compared with the same time period last year.
The week between February 1 and February 8 experienced 110 shooting incidents in 2015 versus 91 in 2014, according to Detective Cheryl Crispin of the NYPD public information office.
New York City's last record for a streak of days without a homicide was 10 days. In 2014, there were no recorded homicides between February 13 and February 22.
