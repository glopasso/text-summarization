The death toll from a plane crash in northwestern Iran has risen to 77, news agencies in the country reported Monday.
Twenty-seven others were injured when the IranAir jet crashed near the city of Orumiyeh, in a snowy and mountainous part of the country, state-run Press TV reported.
Bad weather forced the Boeing 727 to give up its first landing attempt. It was circling for a second approach when air-traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, according to an account on Press TV.
Investigators have recovered the flight data recorders and plan to analyze them to determine what caused the crash, the news agency said, citing Ahmad Majidi, deputy for crisis management in the Road and Transportation Ministry.
The semi-official Fars news agency said the plane went down in farmland after making a second attempt to land.
Official Iranian news agencies reported Sunday that the plane carried 105 passengers and crew members, but Press TV reported a toll Monday -- 77 dead and 27 injured -- that suggests 104 passengers and crew were on board. The discrepancy could not immediately be clarified.
