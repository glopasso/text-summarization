It's not the latest reality television show but real life for the Palin clan, at least according to reports from bloggers.
A vaguely worded police report is less specific about what actually happened at a weekend social gathering in Alaska.
The facts seem to go something like this: Members of the Palin family, including Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee, attended a party Saturday night in Anchorage, where a large brawl broke out. It was also Todd Palin's 50th birthday.
Anchorage police confirmed they "responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation" near a home in Anchorage where a party was taking place.
"Alcohol was believed to have been a factor in the incident. Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party," police spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said in a statement to CNN.
More salacious details were reported by Alaska blogger Amanda Coyne, writing that Track Palin, Sarah Palin's 25-year-old son, "stumbles out of stretch Hummer" and sees an ex-boyfriend of his sister Willow's.
Coyne says that Track and the former boyfriend began arguing, the owner of the house intervened, and with the Palin women screaming, Bristol took several swings and Sarah Palin yelled, "Don't you know who I am?!"
CNN has not yet confirmed Coyne's reporting. CNN has reached out to Palin for comment but has not heard back.
The police said, "None of the involved parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident and no arrests were made at the scene."
Neither Palin's social media accounts nor her online channel mention the party or an altercation. On Sunday, Palin posted a picture on Facebook for "Todd's birthday greeting a day late" because she said she was traveling.
Palin spoke Friday evening at a Houston fundraiser for wounded veterans, giving her plenty of time to fly home and attend Saturday night's shindig.
