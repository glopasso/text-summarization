Jury questionnaires released Saturday revealed five of the jurors in O.J. Simpson's Las Vegas, Nevada, robbery trial said they disagreed with the 1995 verdict where he was found not guilty of two murders.
Jury questionnaires released in O.J. Simpson's robbery trial reveal diverse work and life backgrounds.
All 12 jurors had previously heard about Simpson and all but one knew about his acquittal 13 years ago in the Los Angeles, California, stabbing deaths of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.
One juror said he agreed that Simpson was not guilty while four said they were unsure. Another said she had "no feelings. It is history." One juror did not answer the question.
The nine women and three men on the jury said in the questionnaire they would give Simpson, 61, a fair trial on his latest charges.
After 13 hours of deliberation Friday, the jurors found Simpson guilty on 12 charges of armed robbery and kidnapping in connection with the 2007 attempted heist of memorabilia he said had been stolen from him. The verdict came 13 years to the day after his acquittal in Los Angeles.  Watch O.J. verdict being read »
