A suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan Monday killed 14 people, including three NATO service members and four Afghan police, and wounded 57 others, a spokesman for the Afghan interior ministry said.
The bomber targeted a joint patrol of ISAF forces and Afghan police, using an explosives-packed motorcycle, according to Sediq Seddiqi, a spokesman for the ministry, which condemned the attack.
NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed the attack, saying three ISAF service members and their interpreter died in a bombing in eastern Afghanistan Monday.
Their nationalities of the ISAF forces were not immediately available.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for the attack, saying a suicide bomber had killed eight foreign forces and six Afghan security forces. The Taliban regularly reports higher casualty figures than either NATO or the Afghan government.
