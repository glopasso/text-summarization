Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelati Obeidi flew to Greece Sunday to deliver a personal message from Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, a Greek foreign ministry official told CNN.
Libya asked Greece to allow a special envoy to travel there to communicate a message, Greek foreign ministry spokesman Grigoris Delavekouras said. The nature of that message was not immediately known.
Obeidi met with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou Sunday night, according to Greek Foreign Minister Dimitris Droutsas.
"We stressed -- reiterated -- the clear message of the international community. One of full support and implementation for the decisions of the United Nations, immediate ceasefire and an end to violence, particularly against Libyan civilians," Droutsas said after the meeting.
"From what the Libyan envoy said, it is clear that the administration is looking for a solution," he added.
Obeidi is expected to continue talks in Turkey and Malta, according to Droutsas.
The envoy crossed the Libyan border into Tunisia Sunday morning, and from there boarded a private Greek plane for Athens.
Obeidi is the Libyan deputy foreign minister in charge of European affairs.
