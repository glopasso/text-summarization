An avalanche at a ski resort in northeastern Turkey buried a group of hikers on Sunday, killing 10 of them, authorities said.
Rescue efforts are continuing at the Turkish resort of Zigana, where 10 people have died.
Rescue workers pulled seven survivors from the snow at the resort in Zigana, Turkey, according to Enver Salihoglu, the governor of the nearby city of Gumushane.
At least two of the survivors were hospitalized, Salihoglu told CNN Turk.
Rescue efforts were halted after all climbers were accounted for, according to a spokesperson for Salihoglu.  Watch Turkish avalanche rescue »
The victims were part of a group that was hiking in a valley with mountains on each side.
"We were walking in a single-person line when all of a sudden we saw snow coming down and it took us away," one of the survivors told Turkey's Dogan News Agency from his hospital bed. "When it stopped, I was able to make a hole with one arm and I started breathing from there."
A documentary filmmaker, who had recently been working in the area, told CNN Turk that the temperature had been rising and that may have increased the risk of avalanches in the area.

In all, nine people in two separate parties were caught up in the avalanche, but five escaped injury. One person remains hospitalized, police said.
Police also reminded climbers there is a high risk of avalanches in the Highlands in the next few days.
