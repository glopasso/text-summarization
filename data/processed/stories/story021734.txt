A Delta Air Lines flight reporting an engine problem made an emergency landing Thursday at the Colorado Springs, Colorado, airport, officials said.
Two passengers suffered minor injuries during the evacuation, said John McGinley, assistant director of operations and maintenance at the airport.
Flight 1921, a Boeing 757, was flying from Detroit to Phoenix when the captain saw a light indicating possible problems with one of the engines, Delta spokesman Anthony Black said.
The pilot diverted the flight, and during the landing, the captain received another indicator light showing overheating to the rear wheel, Black said.
FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said there was a fire in the main landing gear when the plane landed.
Passengers were evacuated on slides from the side of the aircraft. CNN affiliate KRDO said the injuries occurred during the evacuation.
