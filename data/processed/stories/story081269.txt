A flurry of late birdies helped American Jason Bohn secure his second PGA Tour title at the Zurich Classic in New Orleans.
The 37-year-old, who celebrated his birthday on Saturday, completed his third round at the rain-affected tournament on Sunday morning before carding a five-under 67 later in the day to secure the title.
Bohn recorded birdies at three of the final four holes to finish on 18-under and stave off the challenge of second-placed Jeff Overton by two shots. He was inches away from an eagle on the last after a superb approach.
"This is life changing," he told the PGA Tour Web site. "I'm probably the only guy on the PGA Tour who has got tears when he's putting out on the 18th hole.
"When I hit the shot on 15 and made the great putt on 16, I knew if I stayed patient I had it."
Bohn's only other tour success came at the B.C. Open in 2005 and since then he has had a number of injuries, including surgery on his back.
After his triumph he said he'd told his caddie before the final round that he was planning on a quiet afternoon.
"I just said I probably wouldn't say much because I'm capturing all of this," Bohn said. "I want to take this one to the grave. I want to remember every little detail that I missed on my first one."
Bohn fought off the challenge of fellow American Overton, who finished second ahead of Troy Merritt, on 16-under.
Meanwhile, Ian Poulter and Padraig Harrington have confirmed they will play in the European Tour's flagship PGA Championship at Wentworth, England.
Both players had boycotted the event in the last two years due to the state of the greens but agreed to return after moderations to the course by South African golfer Ernie Els.
Poulter told the UK Press Association: "It is a great championship and I am looking forward to checking out the modifications to the West Course which Ernie has undertaken. I am sure the changes will be for the better."
