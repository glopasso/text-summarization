A bolt of lightning left 10 soldiers from the New Jersey National Guard with minor injuries during a training exercise Tuesday night, a military spokesman said.
The soldiers were taking part in an exercise in a tent at Fort Drum, outside Watertown, New York, when the lightning strike occurred, 1st Sgt. David Moore told CNN. The injured were members of the 50th Infantry Brigade Combat Team from Lawrenceville, New Jersey, and were among about 2,000 troops taking part in an annual training camp, he said.
Six of the soldiers had already returned to training on Wednesday, Moore said.
