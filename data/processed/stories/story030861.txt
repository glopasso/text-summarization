(CNN)Thump.
The University of Nebraska at Omaha is getting a new $81.6 million stadium for its hockey, basketball and volleyball teams.
Thump.
It'll have luxury suites and everything.
Thump.
But it seems all anyone can talk about these days ...
THUMP
... is the taco cannon.
That's right, we said taco cannon.
An Omaha taco shop has teamed up with the university to shoot tacos into the stands at sporting events. That the foil-wrapped eats will make to fans was made evident when Voodoo Tacos owner Eric Newton demonstrated the power of the cannon for CNN affiliate KETV.
That they'll make it undamaged? Not so much.
"I wouldn't say it would be as restaurant quality when it gets to them, but it's edible," Newton said.
With this latest technological development, the taco will join t-shirts, stuffed toys, balls, biscuits and the lowly hot dog in hurtling into the stands at public gatherings.
UNO fans, um, ate the idea up, sending #tacocannon hurtling past #EarthDay as the No. 1 trending topic Wednesday in Omaha.
"How we roll in Omaha...Frozen Four appearances and projectile tacos," Twitter user mavpuck said, referring to the school's recent, and sadly taco-less, appearance in the NCAA hockey tournament semifinals.
"This just might be the greatest invention.  EVER," thetoddbryant wrote on Twitter.
The tacos will start flying this fall, when the school's new arena is scheduled to open.
But Voodoo Tacos has already scored, catching plenty of publicity months ahead of opening night.
"My partners laughed and me and said 'that's dumb,' " Newton told KETV. "Now they're emailing me and saying, 'About the best thing we've ever bought.' "
