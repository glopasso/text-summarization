David Thompson's Bangkok restaurant nahm is now officially Asia's best restaurant, but the understated Australian-born chef says he's cross.
"I've lost money. I bet against myself," says Thompson.
"I had several bets and it's ranged from two bottles of sauce of Sriracha, a bottle of fish sauce, to quite a few hundred dollars. Damn," he says.
With dishes ranging from smoked fish, peanut and tapioca dumplings, to salted threadfin perch with ginger, chili and green mango on betel leaves, nahm's fiery menu is hailed as a shining example of fine Thai cuisine.
Moving up from third place at last year's inaugural S. Pellegrino & Acqua Panna Asia's 50 Best Restaurants Awards, Thompson says he hopes the honor awarded at last night's glittering ceremony at Capella on Singapore's Sentosa Island, will provide a positive boost during what has been a troubled few months in Thailand.
"Bangkok, as you know, is going through a little bit of a fractious time," he says.
"Hopefully this will help to sustain us, but also show that Thai culture still continues on despite the political disturbances that are occurring at the moment."
Celebrating excellent food and the top chefs of the region, the list of Asia's 50 Best Restaurants is an off-shoot of the prestigious World's 50 Best Restaurant Awards, one of the highest accolades in the industry.
"That might sound obvious because we're in Asia, but there's been a lot of Western influence especially at the fine dining end of the market, a lot of European influence," says William Drew, awards organizer and editor of the UK's Restaurant magazine.
"But I think that perhaps is waning and Asian cuisine is forging a stronger identity in international terms."
Back to our roots
Drew says the best chefs are embracing their unique histories and using them as a basis for creating contemporary, innovative dishes.
One example is the recipient of The Diners Club Lifetime Achievement Award which went to Ivan Li, executive chef and co-owner of Family Li Imperial Cuisine, in Beijing's Shunyi district.
Following in the footsteps of his great grandfather who oversaw the imperial kitchen in the Forbidden City during the Qing dynasty, Li delicately reproduces the recipes passed down through his family for four generations over an oven fire.
"Asian food is very unique," says Li.
"But we have also lost a lot of the traditions of the food culture. Now we're trying to rediscover and recreate some of the traditions."
More than 900 global food experts including chefs, restaurateurs, food writers, food critics and other well traveled gourmands have judged the awards, each choosing their top seven restaurants.
"We don't give them any criteria. It's entirely up to them," says Drew.
"So one judge might be looking for the perfect plate of food, another judge might be more influenced by the atmosphere and the vibe and the whole experience.
"We don't say it has to be about anything except the overall enjoyment of the restaurant," he says.
This year Japan leads Asia's 50 Best Restaurants with 10 of its dining establishments making it onto the list.
Singapore and Hong Kong both have eight restaurants in the top 50 and Mainland China has seven, including Robuchon au Dome in Macau.
Taiwan is represented on the list for the first time with Taichung City's Le Moût taking spot 24, and chef Lanshu Chen named Veuve Clicquot Asia's Best Female Chef.
Lanshu blends the local influences and ingredients she grew up with, with the French culinary traditions she later studied abroad.
Korea is also represented for the first time on the list, with Jungsik in Seoul named No.20.
