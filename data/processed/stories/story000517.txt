English Premier League club Liverpool have agreed a $36 million deal with Ajax for Uruguay striker Luis Suarez.
Liverpool have been haggling with the Dutch outfit over the fee for several days but both announced on their websites that negotiations had proven successful on Friday.
The Reds have now been given permission to discuss personal terms with Suarez and will aim to complete the transfer before the European transfer window closes on January 31.
Liverpool reject Chelsea's bid for Fernando Torres
A statement on the official Ajax website read: "Ajax and Liverpool have reached an agreement over the transfer of Luis Suarez.
"He will make the move to the English club immediately. The deal is worth up to a total of €26.5 million ($36 million)."
Suarez hasn't played a league game for Ajax since November last year after he was banned for seven matches for biting an opponent.
The 24-year-old was infamously sent off during the World Cup quarterfinal against Ghana in July after saving a goal-bound attempt with his hands.
His switch would mark the first signing Kenny Dalglish has made since he returned to Liverpool as manager. The Scot previously won eight league titles as a Reds player and manager.
Liverpool posted a statement on their website that read: "Liverpool Football Club announced this afternoon that they had agreed a fee of up to €26.5 million ($36 million) with Ajax for the transfer of Luis Suarez, subject to the completion of a medical.
"The club have now been given permission by Ajax to discuss personal terms with the player and his representatives."
The deal comes on the same day Liverpool revealed they had turned down a multi-million dollar offer from Chelsea for Spain striker Fernando Torres.
