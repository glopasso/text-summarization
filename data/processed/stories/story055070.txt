Amid rumors that he cheated on wife Tori Spelling, actor and former reality show star Dean McDermott says he's entered rehab.
McDermott, who starred in "Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood" with his wife and their children, didn't provide details about what sort of treatment he's seeking.
"I am truly sorry for the mistakes I have made and for the pain I've caused my family. I take full responsibility for my actions and have voluntarily checked myself into a treatment center to address some health and personal issues," McDermott said in a statement released by his representative Thursday. "I am grateful to be getting the help I need so I can become the husband and father my family deserves."
His decision to check into rehab comes after an Us Weekly story last month alleged that McDermott had cheated on Spelling, his wife of seven years. CNN has not independently confirmed the report.
