(EW.com) -- Listen up, "Happy Endings" fans!
We have the second-best news you could ask for (behind a revival, of course). EW has learned exclusively that VH1 has acquired all 57 episodes of the oh-so-lovable sitcom and will be airing them on Wednesdays in 2014.
Why ABC axed 'Happy Endings'
But first, the cable premiere of "Happy Endings" will begin with a marathon of all 57 episodes starting on New Year's Eve — Tuesday, December 31 — at 8 p.m. ET. The marathon will run all the way through New Year's Day.
But don't worry: If you've got plans to be out on the town, the marathon is only the kick-off event. "Happy Endings" will then settle into its new time slot on Wednesdays from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. starting January 8.
