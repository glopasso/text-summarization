World number two Novak Djokovic continued his impressive form with a straight-sets victory over Ivan Ljubicic on Wednesday, sealing a 6-3 6-3 success at the Shanghai Masters in China.
The Serb defeated his opponent in 81 minutes, and was rarely threatened en route to his 50th win of the season.
The second seed said he is feeling confident and full of energy at the moment, speaking to the official ATP website, Djokovic said: "I definitely am satisfied with the performance, satisfied with my game, physical state [and] my condition.
"I'm playing well, moving well, motivated mentally, and full of energy. I'm hoping that it's going to stay that way."
Andy Murray was similarly untroubled in the second round, enjoying a 6-2 6-2 triumph over Chinese wild card Yan Bai.
The world number four will meet Jeremy Chardy of France in the next round, and he was satisfied with his performance.
Also talking to the ATP website, Murray said: "I thought it was good. I hit the ball cleanly, he played well with some good points and he was quick.
"It was definitely a good first match -- I hit a lot of balls and didn't make too many mistakes.
The 23-year-old will attempt to adopt the same approach for his third round encounter with the 59-ranked Frenchman.
"I'll try and play similar to today, I'll try and dictate the points when I get into the rallies, he likes to use his forehand a lot so I'll try and keep it away from the middle of the court and see what happens."
Another man through to the third round is fifth seed Robin Soderling, who defeated Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic 6-3 7-6.
The Swede took one hour and 44 minutes to come out on top in a hard-fought match.
