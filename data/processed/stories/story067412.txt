(Rolling Stone) -- The Morrissey fan site True to You has reported that the singer recently sustained hand and arm injuries after being attacked by a dog.
No specific details of the attack have emerged, though it did happen somewhere in England. He was treated for the injury in Malmö, Sweden, where an x-ray revealed a fractured index finger on his right hand.

Despite the injury, Morrissey will roll on with his European tour, which will resume with a show tonight at the Operaen in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Perhaps Danish fans will be treated to an oldie with reworked lyrics commenting on the dog attack -- "Heaven Knows I'm Rabid Now," "The Boy With the Dog in His Side," "Sheila Take A Bow Wow," or something like that.
Don't count on it, though.
