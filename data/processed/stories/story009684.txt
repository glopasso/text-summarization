Detroit police have arrested a man suspected to be the rapist who "terrorized" women on the city's Northeast side, the police chief said Monday.
Raynard Coleman, 31, was taken into custody without incident last Wednesday, after DNA evidence tied him to six of seven assaults that have taken place in the city since January 1, Chief Ralph Godbee said.
Police believe the suspect targeted the females, ages 17 to 33, as they waited at or were walking near bus stops. The victims were taken to nearby vacant buildings and assaulted, according to the chief.
Detroit police set up a 24-hour operational command post, which was manned by a specialized joint task force, to receive tips about the attacks, Godbee said. Tips also came in on Facebook, he said.
The police chief credited teamwork from people in the community and the combined efforts of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies for helping in the search for the rapist.
"Every person in this department, community, outside of the community, they were extremely engaged in this process," the chief said. "There is no person in the Detroit metro area that this didn't touch."
Godbee also recognized the victims for coming forth to report the crimes. Without their descriptions, he said, police would not have been able to release a composite sketch to the public.
The charges against Coleman, who has no history of sexual crimes, include kidnapping, aggravated assault, criminal sexual conduct, armed robbery and felony with a firearm, according to Jerry Dorsey IV, with the Wayne County prosecutor's office.
If convicted, Coleman could be sentenced to life in prison, Dorsey said.
