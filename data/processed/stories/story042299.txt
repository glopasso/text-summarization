The death of a Georgia man who fell about 85 feet from an upper level of Atlanta's Turner Field has been ruled a suicide, an official said.
Ronald Homer, 30, fell during a Braves-Phillies baseball game on August 12. The cause of death is blunt force trauma, according to the Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office.
Betty Honey, an investigator with that office, said Thursday that Homer had committed suicide.
He had no other injuries besides those sustained as a result of his fall from the fourth level of the stadium shortly before 8:55 p.m. during a rain delay.
The game was scheduled to start at 7:10 p.m., but heavy rains pushed back the start time nearly two hours.
Homer's was the second such death at an Atlanta sporting venue in the last year or so.
On August 31, 2012, a Tennessee fan died after falling about 45 feet at the Georgia Dome during a college football game between North Carolina State and the University of Tennessee.
