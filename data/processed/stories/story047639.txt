(CNN)  -- Lindsey Vonn of the United States continued her dream finish to the season with victory in the super-G at the World Cup finals in Are on Thursday -- clinching the overall title in the discipline.
Vonn has claimed two crystal globes in two days with successive victories in Are.
It was the second crystal globe in two days for the 24-year-old from Minnesota, who had won the downhill title on Wednesday with another commanding victory, clinching the World Cup overall crown at the same time.
Vonn trailed Switzerland's Fabienne Suter by 15 points going into the final super-G of the season and her cause was helped as Suter produced a disappointing run which eventually saw her finish eighth.
Nadia Fancini of Italy gave herself a chance of taking the overall super-G title by taking the lead from German Maria Riesch with a fine run on the Olympia piste.
But Vonn was not to be denied and edged out Fanchini by 0.08 seconds with a time of one minute 20.63 seconds.
Riesch, who had been her main challenger for overall honors, finished third.
Fanchini had the minor consolation of pipping Suter for second place in the super-G standings, 45 points behind Vonn.
Vonn, who won golds in the world championships last month in downhill and super-G, has now racked up 1788 points in World Cup racing this season and is closing on the all-time record of 1970 by Janica Kostelic in 2006.
It was her ninth World Cup win of the season and 22nd of her career with races in the giant slalom and slalom to come in Sweden to add to her tally.
