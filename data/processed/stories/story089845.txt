Mary Kay Letourneau, the teacher who served more than seven years in prison for raping one of her sixth-grade students, finds herself in trouble with the law again.
She was arrested and accused of driving with a suspended license and failure to appear, according to Julie Murphy, a spokeswoman for King County Adult and Juvenile Detention & Community Corrections in Washington state.
She was booked early Monday morning and released the same day on $5,000 bond, the spokeswoman said.
According to CNN affiliate KIRO, Letourneau will appear in court Tuesday.
Letourneau married her former student, Vili Fualaau, in 2005. They have two children.
