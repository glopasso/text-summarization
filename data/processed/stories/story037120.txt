(CNN)She's a multi-award winning singer, a fashion icon, a designer, entrepreneur, actress and philanthropist.
And now, far from reigning it in, Kylie Minogue will be unleashing her talent at Dubai's internationally renowned equine event.
The 46-year-old pop star will be performing a 90-minute show of her hits at the "world's richest day of horse racing" -- the 20th Dubai World Cup hosted at Meydan on Saturday, March 28.
Prize money totaling $30 million will be up for grabs over a variety of races, culminating in a top prize of $10m in the Dubai World Cup race -- a rendition of Minogue's "I should be so lucky" would certainly be apt.
Luxury brands Longines and Jaguar will be sponsoring two of the races as well as giving prizes to the "Best Dressed Lady" and "Most Elegant Lady" on the night -- offering a 42 diamond studded watch and a Jaguar F-TYPE Coupé to the winners.
Australia's Minogue is worth approximately $75 million after charging to fame following her role as tomboy mechanic "Charlene Robinson" in Neighbours almost 30 years ago.
"Growing up in Melbourne, horse racing is a major and exciting part of our annual calendar.  So to be able to bring my show to the Dubai World Cup is something I'm very much looking forward to," said the star.
She is currently performing her 14th concert tour titled "Kiss Me Once." Since scoring her first top ten UK hit in 1987 she's released eleven studio albums and sold over 68 million records.
"It will certainly be an unforgettable experience" she said of the event.
