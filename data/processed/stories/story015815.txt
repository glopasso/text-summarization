OK, get ready. This is really sweet. I was lucky to find a family who let us into their home to experience a very personal moment -- the moment they said goodbye to their first child going off to college.
Caryn and Doug Kopp of Bedminster, New Jersey, say they feel like it was just yesterday when they were bringing Jamie home from the hospital. Now they are packing up her things and preparing to take her to college -- and girding themselves for a much quieter home once she's no longer around.
Jamie predicts her dad will be the one to cry. Is she right?
