CNN -- Ajax midfielder Evander Sno has suffered a heart attack whilst playing in a reserve match against Vitesse Arnhem on Monday.
A statement on the club's website said the 23-year-old Dutch midfielder had to be resuscitated before later being transferred to hospital, where he is expected to stay for two weeks.
The incident occurred after 60 minutes with Sno, who came on as a half-time substitute, having to be resuscitated three times.
As a result of the former Celtic player's trauma the match was abandoned and he was treated on the pitch for more than ten minutes before regaining consciousness.
Sno has played in for Bristol City in England, following earlier spells with NAC Breda and Feyenoord.
Spain international Antonio Puerta died in 2007 after suffering a heart attack in his club side Sevilla's 4-1 win against Getafe.
In 2004, Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe died after collapsing during an international match in France.
