NATO and Afghan forces fought back Taliban attackers who launched an assault Monday on a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan, near the border with Pakistan.
The insurgents detonated explosives and then began firing guns in an area where NATO supply trucks were parked in Nangarhar province, said Ahmed Zia Abdulzai, a spokesman for the province's governor.
The initial attack was repulsed and Afghan and NATO troops engaged the militants in a firefight for about two hours, during which all the attackers were killed, Abdulzai said.
No civilians or military personnel were killed, he said, and only a few NATO supply trucks caught fire during the violence.
Firefighters are trying to put out the flames, he said.
Taliban spokesman Zabiulah Mujahid claimed the attack, in which several suicide bombers participated, had killed soldiers at the base.
But NATO said that no service members from its International Security Assistance Force had died.
Situated at the border town of Torkham, the base is a transit point for the NATO supplies from Pakistan.
The attack prompted authorities to close the border with Pakistan at Torkham and suspend traffic on the highway between Torkham and the Afghan city of Jalalabad.
