(CNN)One of the performers from "Orange Is the New Black" joked during the red-carpet preshow to the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards that the TV director would need a wide shot to capture the cast if the show won.
Cue the extra-large lens. The Netflix show won for best comedy series cast.
The award was accepted by star Uzo Aduba, who earlier had won her own Actor (the SAG Award trophy) for female actor in a comedy.
For that first award, Aduba -- who plays "Crazy Eyes" Warren -- looked like she was going to pass out as she approached the stage.
"I really, truly don't know what to say," she said. She emotionally thanked a number of the show's principals, including creator Jenji Kohan.
William H. Macy, who won best actor in a comedy series for his performance in "Shameless," was just the opposite, loose and jokey.
"I've written so many great speeches I never got to give," he said as he accepted his trophy. "But not tonight."
The 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards are airing on TNT and TBS. Both networks are part of Time Warner, as is CNN.
