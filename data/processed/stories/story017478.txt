(EW.com) -- "The Sing-Off" has found its new judge: Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Jewel is coming to NBC's cult-favorite a cappella competition series this winter.
Jewel will join Boyz II Men's Shawn Stockman and Ben Folds as judges on the show, and Nick Lachey will return as host. The singer replaces exiting singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles on the show.
"There are very few musical artists as accomplished and talented as Jewel," said Paul Telegdy, NBC's president of alternative programming. "Her addition to 'The Sing-Off' judges panel, along with our stellar team of Shawn Stockman and Ben Folds, raises the showmanship of the series up another notch."
NBC shelved "The Sing-Off " last year, then revived the competition series for a fourth season in March with executive producer Mark Burnett taking charge. Jewel previously served as an adviser on Burnett's "The Voice" last year.
"Jewel is one of America's greatest singer songwriters and is an amazing storyteller," Burnett said. "...The Sing-Off is sure to be its best [season] yet."
"The Sing-Off" will return in December.
