South Korea will hold its largest-ever winter live-fire drills Thursday in an area adjacent to North Korea, the South Korean Army said on Wednesday.
The drills are scheduled as tensions between the two countries remain high.
South Korea held live-fire military exercises earlier this week, a move that North Korea said could ignite a war.
Both Koreas have traded tough talk and conducted military drills in the weeks after North Korea shelled a South Korean island last month.
