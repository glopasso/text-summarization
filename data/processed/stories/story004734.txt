A struggling German soccer team is offering a refund to its fans who traveled to another city to watch it suffer a 4-0 loss.
Cottbus are second from the bottom of the German Bundesliga.
More than 600 Energie Cottbus supporters saw their team suffer its sixth loss in seven games when it received a 4-0 drubbing Friday at the hands of another team, Schalke.
Cottbus are second from the bottom in the German Bundesliga's ranking and is in danger of being relegated to a lower league at the end of the season.
The team posted a Web statement Saturday headlined, "Sorry, Energie Fans!"
In it, the team said its players "did not manage at any time to stand up to a high-class opponent with our particular qualities of passion, dedication and one-on-one duels."
"Certainly one can lose at Schalke," the team manager Steffen Heidrich said in the statement. "Nevertheless we did not put up enough defense against the class of the individuals of this opponent."
The team said it will announce details in the coming weeks of how fans can receive a refund on their admission ticket.
"I welcome the apologetic gesture of the team to its fans," Heidrich said. "Real compensation must actually be given in the coming matches."
