Peyton Manning will play in a third Super Bowl after guiding the Denver Broncos to a 26-16 win over Tom Brady and the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship game.
Super Bowl XLVIII in New Jersey will be the Broncos' first appearance in the NFL's championship game in 15 years. The Seattle Seahawks stand between Manning and the Vince Lombardi trophy.
Manning will be looking to win a second championship ring, having previously led the Indianapolis Colts to a title in 2006.
"Well, it's an exciting feeling," said the 37-year-old veteran and four-time NFL MVP, who will be looking to lead the Broncos to a third Super Bowl title.
"You do take a moment to realize that we've done something special here and you certainly want to win one more.
"You have to take time to savor the moment. Being in my 16th season and going to my third Super Bowl I know how hard it is to get there. It is extremely difficult."
The Seahawks will meet the Broncos at MetLife Stadium on February 2 after coming from 10-0 down to beat the San Francisco 49ers 23-17 in the NFC Championship game Sunday.
"We knew we weren't in the lead but that didn't matter," said Seattle coach Pete Carroll. "They were going to go out and get it done no matter what it took."
While the Broncos look forward to a seventh Super Bowl appearance, the Seahawks' only previous appearance in the season finale came in 2005 -- a 25-10 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.
