A suspect in the shooting death of South African soccer team captain Senzo Meyiwa has been charged with murder and robbery, a National Prosecuting Authority spokesman said Friday.
Zanokuhle Mbatha appeared at the Boksburg Magistrate Court to face the charges and then was remanded in custody until November 11 to give him time to apply for legal aid, National Prosecuting Authority spokesman Nathi Mncube said on Twitter.
"There are still suspects outstanding & we appeal to public to continue providing info," authorities added on Twitter.
Football world mourns death of South Africa captain Meyiwa
Meyiwa was shot and killed Sunday night during a botched robbery by intruders who went into a house in the Vosloorus township near Johannesburg, authorities said.
Police haven't disclosed what led to the shooting, but local media circulated reports that it may have been over a mobile phone.
Meyiwa, 27, was captain of the national team as well as his club, Orlando Pirates.
Meyiwa began playing for the Pirates in 2005 and made his debut with the national team in June 2013. The goalkeeper didn't concede a single goal in the last four games in the African Cup of Nations qualifiers.
His last match was Saturday when the Pirates advanced to the semifinals of the South African League Cup.
The police have offered a reward of 150,000 rand ($13,670) for information leading to the "arrest/conviction" of suspects in the case.
