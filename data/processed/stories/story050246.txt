Four bodies with gunshot wounds were found in a southern Indiana home late Saturday night, authorities said.
Officials are investigating their deaths as a quadruple homicide, Bartholomew County Sheriff Mark Gorbett said.
No suspect is in custody.
"We've been working around the clock and will continue to do so until we can bring those responsible to justice," Gorbett said Sunday.
Three men were found dead in the living room, and a woman was found dead in the bedroom, Gorbett said.
They were identified as Aaron Cross, 41, Shawn Burton, 41, Thomas Smith, 39, and Katherine Burton, 53, CNN affiliate WXIN reported, citing Gorbett.
The bodies were found in Waynesville, about halfway between Indianapolis and Louisville, Kentucky.
