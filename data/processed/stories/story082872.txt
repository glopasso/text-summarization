Don't mess with a Stark.
Maisie Williams, who plays Arya Stark on HBO's hit series "Game of Thrones," got into a row on Twitter with British Airways. It seems that the 17-year-old took offense to the airline's policy of not allowing those younger than 18 into its airport business lounge.
And just like her tough-as-nails character, Williams refused to back down.
She tweeted on Saturday, "Denied from the business lounge once again for being under 18 and without an adult.. @British_Airways sort your s**t out."
The actress went on to tweet, "I'm not saying I deserve special treatment. Just saying if 16-18 yr olds are grown up enough to travel 5,400 miles around the world.. I'm sure we can handle sitting quietly in the damn lounge."
The airline replied to the star, "we're sorry if you were disappointed, lounge guests must be 18 or older. We look forward to welcoming you soon." Williams responded with "Yes.. @British_Airways fully understand that, my question is why? Why can we travel alone but not use the lounge? It makes no sense."
British Airways explained that the restriction was "due to the complimentary alcohol available."
Williams got some support from singer Ed Sheeran, who tweeted "Ah British airways. You failed again."
For now, Williams will have to wait until April 15, when she turns 18. Might we suggest a party in the British Airways business lounge?
