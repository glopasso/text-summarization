Two Amish girls, who were apparently abducted from a roadside farm stand in upstate New York, have been found and are safe, authorities said early Friday.
An Amber Alert was issued late Wednesday in Oswegatchie for Delila Miller, 6, and her sister, Fannie, 12. They had been selling vegetables near their family farm, located about 50 miles southeast of the Canadian border.
A witness told police the girls were tending to a customer who drove up in a white 4-door sedan and disappeared when the vehicle pulled away, according to the Amber Alert.
Rhonda Wells, senior dispatcher for St. Lawrence County Sheriff, told CNN early Friday that the girls had been located and were safe.
She declined to provide further details, saying a press release will be issued later Friday. The Amber Alert has been canceled.
St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells had said Thursday at a news conference that multiple agencies were investigating leads called in by the public.
Pictures of the girls were not available because members of the Amish community forbid photos of themselves, which they see as a violation of their religious beliefs.
"I wouldn't say it's hindering the investigation, it's just that it would be helpful" to have photos, Wells said. "In the Amish world, photos aren't going to be available."
He said the Amish community "is always cooperative with us and forthcoming,"
Police late Thursday released a sketch of the older girl, Fannie, to help in the search.
