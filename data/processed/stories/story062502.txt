Fourteen people were killed and another 60 were injured in Indonesia over a four-day period as a result of Cyclone Iggy, according to the country's National Disaster Management Agency.
Most of those who died were struck by falling trees or debris from strong winds, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. More than 2,000 homes were also damaged in 35 towns or cities in Java and Bali between Wednesday and Sunday, he said.
The government has provided food and aid to the areas affected, the agency said.
As of Sunday, Iggy was off the northwestern coast of Australia, said Tom Sater, meteorologist for CNN International.
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology issued a cyclone warning for the coastal area from Onslow to Coral Bay, including Exmouth. Iggy is currently classified as a Category 1 cyclone and is near stationary, according to the warning.
Iggy is forecast to stay offshore and avoid the coast of Western Australia, said Sater. The effects of Iggy, however, may create high sea conditions, he said.
In anticipation of the storm, Australia has shut down some of its coastal oil operations, according to Sater.
Iggy is "expected to continue to move very slowly overnight before taking a more southwesterly track during Monday," the Australian Bureau of Meteorology said in a Sunday advisory.
