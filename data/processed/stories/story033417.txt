A 14-year-old cruise passenger was killed in a crossfire Monday as she rode on a tour bus on the U.S. Virgin Islands, police said.
Authorities said the shooting happened just before noon in the Coki Point area of St. Thomas. They found the girl wounded on the bus and a man who had been fatally shot in the street, police said in a statement. She was identified as Liz Marie Perez Chapparro of Puerto Rico by the U.S. Virgin Islands Department of Tourism.
Chapparro was taken to a hospital, where she died from her injuries, police said.
The shootout between the unidentified man and the driver of a red Honda occurred at the funeral of Joseph Ferrari, who was shot to death at a mall parking lot on June 29. The driver in Monday's shooting ran away from the scene, police said.
Three others were arrested as police searched the area. Police said they found ammunition on the dead man's body.
Chapparro's family immediately flew home to Puerto Rico, the tourism department said.
