Kenya's Geoffrey Mutai set a course record in the ING New York Marathon on Sunday, cutting nearly three minutes from a previous best time that had stood for a decade.
Mutai finished in 2 hours, 5 minutes and 6 seconds, according to the official website for the race, breaking the old record of 2:07:43 set by Ethiopia's Tesfaye Jifar in 2001, the website said.
All three top finishers beat the previous course record. Another Kenyan, Emmanuel Mutai (no relation to the winner) finished second in 2:06:28, and Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia was in third at 2:07:14.
The highest finishing American man, Meb Keflezighi, took sixth place, with a time of 2:09:13.
Ethiopia's Firehiwot Dado, 27, won the women's division in her first running of this event, with a time of 2:23:15, the website said.
Mutai, 30, also won the Boston Marathon in April with a world-best time of 2:03:02. However, that record is not recognized internationally, however, as the day's strong tailwinds and the course's incline drops fall outside of the International Association of Athletics Federations' record-setting regulations.
Dado's victory was her first in a major marathon, and her fifth overall. She surged past pre-race favorite Mary Keitany in the final mile. Buzunesh Deba, originally from Ethiopia but now living in New York, finished second in the women's division at 2:23:19. Keitany finished third with a time of 2:23:38. Molly Pritz, the highest-finishing American woman, came in 12th place with a time of 2:31:52.
Masazumi Soejima from Japan won the wheelchair division with a time of 1:31:41, while Italy's Alessandro Zanardi's time of 1:13:58 propelled him to first place in the hand cycle division. More than 200 wheelchair and hand cycle athletes participated in this year's marathon.

CNN has learned that a 30-year-old male runner collapsed of cardiac arrest and was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital.
The annual event has come a long way since the first race in 1970, when only 127 runners participated and 55 finished a route that coursed within Central Park.
This year's race had 47,107 entrants. The race expanded to the city's five boroughs in 1976.
The wheelchair and hand cycle divisions were added in 2000.
