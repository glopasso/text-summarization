Wales went to the top of rugby union's Six Nations Championship with a 27-13 win over Scotland Sunday at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium.
It was the second straight victory for the Welsh, who beat Ireland 23-21 in their opener in Dublin.
They next face England, who have also won their first two matches, at Twickenham where a victory will give them the Triple Crown.
Scotland, beaten by England at Murrayfield last weekend, battled to hold Wales to 3-3 at halftime.
But the home side dominated the second half with two tries from full-back Leigh Halfpenny, with wing Alex Cuthbert also crossing.
Halfpenny ended with a tally of 22 points while Scotland had the consolation of scoring their first try in five Tests as they battled bravely to stay in the match.
New fly-half Greig Laidlaw, in for the retired Dan Parks, crossed for the Scots, but they suffered for losing backs Nick de Luca and Rory Lamont to the sin bin after the break.
Down to 13-men, the Welsh took full advantage to take control and Scotland were left contemplate the wooden spoon after two straight defeats.
"Yellow cards are always crucial in this day and age so everybody has to work on their discipline," Wales flanker and man-of-the-match Dan Lydiate told BBC Sport.
"Once we go through the phases we know we're dangerous, but fair play to Scotland they came back into it."
Wales played without captain Sam Warburton, who pulled out just before the start of the match through a niggling injury.
England scored a narrow win over Italy Saturday in the only other Six Nations match played this weekend.
The clash between France and Ireland was called off due to a frozen pitch at the Stade de France.
