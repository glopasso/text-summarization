(CNN)  -- Defending world champion Jorge Lorenzo of Spain claimed victory in Sunday's Italian MotoGP at Mugello to close the gap on Casey Stoner in the overall title standings.
Australian Stoner began the race in pole position and led for the opening 17 of the 23-lap race.
But Lorenzo took the lead with a superb overtaking move on a steep, downhill chicane and steadily pulled away for an impressive victory, with Stoner having to contend with finishing in third position after also being overtaken by Honda teammate Andrea Dovizioso on the final lap.
American Ben Spies, the winner in Assen last weekend, finished fourth with Marco Simoncelli fifith and Italian legend Valentino Rossi -- racing in front of his home fans for the first time since joining Ducati -- finishing sixth.
Talking to BBC TV, Lorenzo said: ""I'm so happy with the win. Casey was so quick but little by little, lap by lap I managed to catch him.
"I finally saw the opportunity to overtake Casey on the downhill section and was able to take it," he added.
Stoner blamed a problem with his tires for the defeat, adding: "I did everything I could but the tire pressure went up too high and I lost all grip in the rear.
"I tried to keep a consistent pace but I was just too slow at the end," Stoner continued.
The result leaves 2007 world champion Stoner with a 19-point advantage in the current championship standings.
Stoner lies on 152 points after eight of the 18 races, with Yamaha rider Lorenzo lying second on 133 points.
Dovizioso (119) and Rossi (91) lie third and fourth in the standings with Nicky Hayden (77 points) rounding out the top five.
