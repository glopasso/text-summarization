A Virginia woman is being hailed as a hero after she reportedly lifted a car off her father and performed CPR, saving his life.
Alec Kornacki was in the family garage Saturday working on a car when a jack holding it up slipped, according to Kristen Kornacki, another one of his daughters.
Lauren Kornacki, the daughter who rescued him, found her father pinned to the ground and unresponsive.
"She proceeded to lift up the car, pull him out and then give him CPR," said Kristen Kornacki.
Lauren Kornacki, 22, who lives in Glen Allen, near Richmond, is trained as a lifeguard, according to CNN affiliate WWBT.
"It flashed like, oh my God, I'm going to lose my dad," she told the affiliate. "I knew I had to get his heart beating again."
Alec Kornacki is being treated at the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center. A call seeking comment on his condition was not immediately returned.
He has several broken ribs, some numbness and other fractures, but likely suffered no permanent damage, according to WWBT. He is still in the ICU.
According to his daughter Kristen, Alec Kornacki is "healing fantastically." His family shot a brief video of him walking in the hospital hallway, slow but steady.
"He is walking and talking and laughing and joking. He's feeling pretty good," she said. "He's Superman, that's for sure."
