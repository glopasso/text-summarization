Five security forces who worked for a private company were killed in the attack, in Zabul province, said Gulab Shah Alikhail, the deputy governor.
After the ambush, Afghan army forces were called in, Alikhail said.
Alikhail put the militants' death toll at 32.
On Saturday, a roadside bomb killed 10 Afghan police officers in Kandahar province, according to Police Chief Matiullah Khan.
