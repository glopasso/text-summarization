Three suicide attackers died Saturday in a strike on a NATO base in Afghanistan's capital, the Interior Ministry said.
The incident occurred at Camp Phoenix in Kabul.
Two of them detonated explosive devices near the base and another was shot and killed by police before he could set off bombs.
The attackers also carried small arms and rocket-propelled grenades before they were killed.
There were no other casualties reported by Afghanistan authorities. NATO's International Security Assistance Force did not have any immediate comment.
