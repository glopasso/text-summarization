(CNN)Amanda Knox, convicted last year for a second time by an Italian court in the 2007 death of her British roommate, is engaged, a source close to the family told CNN.
The former exchange student, 27, got engaged last week to musician Colin Sutherland, the source said. No other details of the engagement were provided.
Knox, along with ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, was first convicted in Italy in Meredith Kercher's death in 2009. After spending four years in an Italian prison, she was released and had returned to her home in Seattle when the verdicts were overturned on appeal in 2011.

After her release from prison and return to the United States, Knox resumed her studies at the University of Washington. Her memoir recounting the ordeal, "Waiting to Be Heard," was released in 2013.
Last year, she and Sollecito were again convicted. Italy's highest court is expected to hear an appeal in the case on March 25 and decide whether Italy may seek to force her to return.
