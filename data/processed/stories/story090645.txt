(CNN)  -- Espanyol captain Daniel Jarque has died from a heart attack while on a pre-season training camp in Italy.
Jarque's death has stunned Barcelona-based Espanyol.
The 26-year-old defender  died at the hotel where the team were staying in the town of Coviciana.
He was found after teammates realized he had not come for an evening meal.
Club doctors and Italian paramedics tried to revive Jarque, a product of the Espanyol youth system, but without success.
Jarque's death comes two years after the death, also from heart failure, of Sevilla defender Antonio Puerta, who died after collapsing in the opening game of the Spanish Primera Liga season.
It is shattering blow for the Barcelona-based club, who beat Liverpool 3-0 in a pre-season friendly as part of their preparation for the start of La Liga with Jarque playing in the match.
A statement on the club Web site, www.rcdespanyol.cat confirmed the terrible news on Saturday night.
"Tragedy struck Espanyol and the family of Dani Jarque this evening. The blanquiazul player died from a cardiac arrest. "
"The doctor Cervera carried out CPR on the player and used a defibrillator, which showed that the arrest was non-responsive.
"The medical services continued carrying out CPR, administering adrenaline and atropine for an hour, but the player's heart did not react, so finally that determined his death.
"RCD Espanyol, broken with pain, wish to put themselves at the absolute disposition of the family of our captain Dani Jarque, to whom go our warmest thoughts."
Espanyol, who had been due to play Italian side Bologna on Sunday, have suspended their pre-season tour of Italy and will fly back to Barcelona.
Jarque joined Espanyol at the age of 12, making his debut in 2002, and was given the captaincy this summer as a reward for his strong performances.
