(CNN)Maroon 5 pulls off the ultimate wedding heist in their newest video, "Sugar." And it's sure to leave you with a smile.
Their mission: surprise couples on their wedding day.
"We are going to drive across L.A. and hit every wedding we possibly can," says frontman Adam Levine as the video starts. "It's going to be awesome."
The video was shot in the Los Angeles area on December 6, 2014. In it, the band drive from wedding venue to wedding venue, and sneak up on stage that's enclosed by giant curtains.
The magic happens when the curtains drop.
The looks of the faces around the room are priceless: delight, tears, confusion.
So, how did the band pull off the surprises?
"Only the grooms knew in each case," a representative for Maroon 5 told Entertainment Tonight.
The band is not sure if the grooms "disclosed it to their bride and wedding party."
"They had stages set up for their actual wedding band already. All we did was some simple continuity changes to match each one as best we could."
If the crashing concept looks familiar, that's because it is.
In the 2005 film, "Wedding Crashers,"  Jeremy Grey and John Beckwith, played by Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson, brought wedding crashing to the big screen.
David Dobkin who directed the movie also did the video.
"It was an out of body experience," Levine told People Magazine in a press release.
"I had no idea I would be affected by the overwhelming reactions we received from the couples and guests. Being able to create an unforgettable experience for several people was the highlight of it all."
