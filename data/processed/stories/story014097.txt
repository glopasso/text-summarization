Obamacare might be a big talking point for politicians on Capitol Hill, but a new survey shows President Barack Obama's health care law wasn't at the top of the agenda for midterm voters earlier this month.
Party preferences and individual candidate platforms -- not the Affordable Care Act -- were the main factors that drove Americans to their polling places, according to a survey about health care released Friday by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
When asked in their own words to name what influenced their vote for a member of Congress, just over one quarter of voters surveyed said that the most important factor was making sure their party had control. Twenty one percent of Democratic voters said that a candidate's platform was important, while the same percentage of Republican voters said that jobs and the economy factored heavily into their decision.
Only 13 percent of Democrats and 8 percent of Republicans listed health care in the top two factors that mattered most to them.

The survey also showed that 5 percent of Republican voters specifically mentioned their opposition to the Affordable Care Act. On the other end of the spectrum, 3 percent of Democratic voters voiced their support for the ACA as the reason they cast a ballot.
When asked about the specifics of the law, 16 percent of those surveyed said the law has helped them and their families, compared to 24 percent who said the opposite. The majority -- 59 percent -- said that so far, the ACA has had no direct impact.
Overall, Obama's health care law maintains a 46 percent unfavorability rating according to the poll, a number that has remained relatively steady since its implementation in March 2010. Thirty-seven percent have a favorable view of the law.
The Kaiser Foundation conducted the survey of about 1,500 American adults Nov. 5-13 via telephone. The margin of error is 3 percentage points.
