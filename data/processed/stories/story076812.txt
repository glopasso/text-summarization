CNN has equipped a group of volunteers with cameras, laptops and a brand new Web site. They are blogging and posting videos of their lives and new jobs as they fan out across three continents for the next 12 months.
As they set out to change the world around them, there are plenty of other organizations and individuals that are working with the same goal.
CNN has made a list of the groups that can help you to make a positive impact on the world around you. Visit their Web sites to get more details on how you too can Be The Change.
