(CNN)  -- Game show host and comedian Howie Mandel's irregular heartbeat scare is over, his publicist said Tuesday.
Howie Mandel had an irregular heartbeat, but he did not have a heart attack, his publicist said.
"Howie has been released from the hospital and will be back at work tomorrow," said Lewis Kay. "He appreciates everyone's concern."
Mandel, 53, checked into a Toronto hospital Monday so doctors could monitor his condition, Kay said.
He was in Toronto, filming segments for a new show "Howie Do It." The hour-long prank show debuted on NBC Friday.
Mandel is the host of the American version of the game show "Deal or No Deal," which has brought huge ratings for NBC.
