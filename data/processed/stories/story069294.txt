Carrie Underwood continued her reign over the CMT Music Awards on Wednesday night.
The platinum-selling singer and former "American Idol" champion took home the country music ceremony's top honor, video of the year, for her hit "See You Again." It was the fifth time Underwood snagged the award and her third win in a row.
Before accepting her buckle, Underwood performed "Somethin' Bad," her duet with fellow country superstar Miranda Lambert, who won female video of the year for her tune "Automatic." Lambert's husband, singer and "The Voice" coach Blake Shelton, scored in the male video category for "Doin' What She Likes."
Shelton was also on hand to present Cassadee Pope with the breakthrough video of the year for "Wasting All These Tears." Shelton mentored Pope on "The Voice," and when she won, an overwhelmed Pope asked, "What do I do?" to which Shelton joked, "still coaching you."
Other winners included Florida Georgia Line, who won duo of the year for "Round Here" and collaborative video of the year with Luke Bryan for "This Is How We Roll." Bryan and Lionel Richie also won the CMT performance of the year awards for "Oh No/All Night Long."
But the night belonged to the many performances of the evening.
Florida Georgia Line, Bryan and pop singer Jason Derulo teamed up for a mashup of their respective hits "This is How We Roll" and "Talk Dirty," while R&B star John Legend, Jennifer Nettles and Hunter Hayes performed a specially arranged version of Legend's No. 1 hit "All of Me."
Kacey Musgraves and Lee Ann Womack paid a performance tribute to Alan Jackson, who was honored for his 25 years in the industry with the first CMT Impact Award.
Actress Kristen Bell hosted the awards show in Nashville.
