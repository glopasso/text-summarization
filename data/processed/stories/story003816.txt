Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan Solomon tearfully pleaded Thursday for leniency for her brother, who was sentenced to prison on a lesser charge in his fatal altercation with their father.
A Middlesex County Superior Court judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to 2.5 years after a jury convicted him Wednesday of assault and battery.
A jury acquitted Kerrigan on an involuntary manslaughter charge. The prosecution argued that the elder Kerrigan died from a heart attack caused during a physical struggle.
Solomon asked Judge Jane Haggerty for no prison time for her brother, saying the family had already suffered enough trauma and hardship.
"None of us have had really the chance to grieve for our father," she said in court.
Mark Kerrigan was taken into custody immediately, said Cara O'Brien, spokeswoman for the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office.
The judge sentenced Mark Kerrigan to serve two years in prison, followed by two years of probation, during which he will have to satisfy several conditions, including mental health and alcohol abuse treatment, according to O'Brien.
If Kerrigan completes all the conditions, the remaining six months of his prison sentence will be suspended, the judge ruled.
Mark Kerrigan showed little emotion as the verdict was read Wednesday in Woburn, Massachusetts.
"My family has never believed at all that my brother had anything to do with my father's death," Nancy Kerrigan said outside the courthouse. "My dad would never have wanted any of this."
Prosecutors say Daniel Kerrigan, 70, died after having an argument and physical confrontation with his intoxicated son.
A medical examiner had found that Daniel Kerrigan's 2010 death came from cardiac dysrhythmia triggered by the brawl, which resulted in a larynx injury. Cardiac dysrhythmia is abnormal electrical activity in the heart.
Kerrigan's family has said Daniel Kerrigan had a heart condition.
