Los Angeles Galaxy captain Landon Donovan has decided against making another loan move to a European club during American soccer's offseason.
The United States international spent three months with English Premier League outfit Everton at the start of 2010, but will not repeat the stint when the international transfer window reopens on January 1.
"I feel that it is important to continue to rest and recover this offseason as opposed to going on loan," he told the Major League Soccer website, adding that he had not considered going to any club other than Everton.
"I have been playing nearly non-stop for the past two years and I believe that this decision will allow me to perform at my best for the Galaxy and the national team throughout the upcoming year."
The 29-year-old scored two goals in 10 games for Everton last season, and also made six appearances during a similar loan spell with German side Bayern Munich in 2009.
"We expect Landon to join our club for the start of preseason training next month as we begin to prepare for the 2011 MLS season," Galaxy head coach Bruce Arena said.
Donovan has been named US Soccer's Male Athlete of the Year for the fourth time in his career.
The attacking midfielder scored three times at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and led the Galaxy to the Western Conference title before losing to eventual runners-up Dallas in the MLS Cup playoffs.
"I want to thank everyone who chose me for this honor," Donovan said. "I am very proud to have been part of this team and how we represented ourselves this year."
