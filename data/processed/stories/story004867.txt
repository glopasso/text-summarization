India on Wednesday invited the Prime Minister of its archrival Pakistan to the swearing-in of its new leader, Narendra Modi.
Invitations were extended to the heads of all eight countries in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, which includes Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Indian external affairs ministry said.
"This is the first time that India has invited all SAARC members to attend a swearing-in ceremony of a prime minister," ministry spokesman Syed Akbaruddin said.
Asked whether the move marked the start of a better relationship with Pakistan, he remarked, "Let's take one step at a time.
"At this stage, the invitations have gone. Let's take responses on this and we will take it from there, rather than jump to conclusions on the basis of our first step."
The swearing-in is set to take place Monday.
