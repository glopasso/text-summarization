(Rolling Stone) -- Mumford & Sons confirmed that their second album will released on September 24 in an interview conducted by 3FM backstage at the Pinkpop festival in the Netherlands yesterday.
"We finished the record this week," says multi-instrumentalist Ben Lovett. "We hope to get it out in September. We just figured that out, September 24th."
Lovett says that the band's new album will not be tremendously different from their hit debut "Sigh No More."
"There's similarities, yeah," he says. "Nothing's really changed in our dynamic as a band. We write songs together and they're very much based in our experiences. The instruments are pretty much the same, except for a few we've picked up along the way. For the most part, it's a progression. We don't want to reinvent ourselves."
The band have commitments to play several shows in the meantime, but according to Lovett, they will be focusing on material from "Sigh No More" in those gigs.
"Right now we're in a period between the two records, but we're very much focusing on moving forward. We're going to play some of the songs from 'Sigh No More' in the next few months and I guess every band has to go through it, but it's new to us."
Later that night, Mumford & Sons joined Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band for a joyful rendition of "Hungry Heart."
