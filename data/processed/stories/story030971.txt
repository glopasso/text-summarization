Computer issues prompted a temporary ground stop at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Wednesday.
The computer failure occurred at the Federal Aviation Administration's Los Angeles Flight Center, which controls air traffic for the region.
All arriving flights that were inside the flight center's airspace at the time of the ground stop landed at the airport, according to LAX spokeswoman Nancy Suey Castles.
Approximately 10 inbound flights that were outside that airspace were diverted to other airports.
"Airlines at LAX are reporting an estimated 10 cancellations and 110 departure delays throughout tonight," the spokeswoman said.
Earlier, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown stressed that radar was not down and that authorities hoped to resolve the computer glitch soon. The agency had warned of the potential for gridlock at some area airports, citing significant volume already en route.
Departure delays of up to two hours were reported at LAX, one hour at Salt Lake City International Airport and up to an hour and a half at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas.
Officials had said ground stops were also in effect at Bob Hope Airport in Burbank, Long Beach Airport and John Wayne Airport, all in California.
According to LAX, the airport is the sixth busiest in the world, and the third busiest in the United States.
