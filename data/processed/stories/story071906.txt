The imprisoned American man who allegedly confessed to crimes in North Korea is not the same son his mother remembers.
"He's not my usual son, kind of different," Myunghee Bae, mother of Kenneth Bae, told CNN's Chris Cuomo on Wednesday.
Kenneth Bae, who has been jailed in North Korea for 15 months, told reporters there that he committed a "serious crime" in the secretive nation and that he had not experienced abusive treatment by the regime.
But any statement made by Bae in captivity would be sanctioned by the North Korean government, whose widespread human rights abuses are known to the world. The country has a long history of exacting false confessions.
There was something off, his mother said, when she saw him on television.
"He's not my usual son, kind of different. My heart aches when I saw him," she said.
In his remarks, Kenneth Bae asked the U.S. government, the media and his family to not make things worse by spreading "vile rumors" about North Korea.
He also asked his family and other supporters to make more active efforts to secure his freedom.
"We're hoping that we're getting closer to the end," Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN. "I'm glad that he had a platform to speak, but it is also flooded back with a lot of mixed emotions, watching him in that prison uniform."
The family is scared for him, Chung said, and is appealing to anyone who may help Bae's cause.
"We believe that Kenneth is being treated well, as he said, and we hope that North Korean authorities will have mercy and allow Kenneth to come home," she said.
The U.S. government is doing what it can, Chung said, adding that she thinks that "things are in the works."
Bae, of Lynwood, Washington, was arrested in November 2012 in Rason, along North Korea's northeastern coast. The devout Christian and father of three operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to his family and freekennow.com, a website that friends set up to promote his release.
"He looks very distressed," Bae's mother said. "He has a strong, strong mind, but, I don't know, after 15 months, he has to maintain the same stable mind all the time. I'm kind of worried about that."
