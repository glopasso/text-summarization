Film composer John Barry has died after an award-winning career spent writing the score for many movies, including 11 James Bond films, a friend said.
Barry won Academy Awards for his work on "Dances with Wolves" in 1990 and "Out of Africa" in 1985. He also won for "The Lion in Winter" in 1968 and "Born Free" in 1966, according to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. He was nominated in 1992 for his work on "Chaplin" and in 1971 for his work on "Mary, Queen of Scots."
He also wrote the theme songs to 11 James Bond movies, according to United Agents, the agency that represented him.
"There was something elegantly effortless about the way John created seemingly simple tunes that were in fact very complex," said David Arnold, a friend and fellow Bond composer. "The fact that these tunes went straight to your heart is just more evidence of the man's genius."
