The Wegmans supermarket chain is recalling 5,000 pounds of Turkish pine nuts because of possible salmonella contamination, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said.
At least 43 cases of salmonellosis in California, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Virginia are linked to the pine nuts, the FDA said Friday, citing the Centers for Disease Control. The agency warned consumers not to eat the nuts, offered for sale in unlabeled plastic bulk containers at Wegmans stories, or any food items, such as pesto or salads, that have been made using them.
The pine nuts were ingredients in several prepared foods sold at Wegmans, including Caprese salad and asparagus with pine nuts, the agency said.
The pine nuts may be contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis, which may cause illness. They were sold in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Virginia and Maryland, the FDA said.
The salmonella bacteria can cause diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps 12 to 72 hours after infection. The illness usually lasts four to seven days, the FDA said. While most people recover without treatment, infection may lead to hospitalization and can be fatal. The bacteria is most dangerous to older adults, infants and those with compromised immune systems, the FDA said.
Consumers are urged to check their homes for the nuts purchased at Wegmans stores between July 1 and October 18, and either throw them away or return them to Wegmans for a refund, the FDA said.
Wegmans said the pine nuts were imported from Turkey and distributed by Sunrise Commodities.
