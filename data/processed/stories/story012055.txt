Officials in Brazil say they fear the death toll may rise after four days of flooding left at least 33 people dead and thousands homeless.
The flooding has mainly affected the northeastern states of Pernambuco and Alagoas.
More than 1,000 people are missing in Alagoas with about 500 people unaccounted for in the town of Uniao dos Palmares alone, a state spokesman said.
According to Brazil's civil defense agency, more than 40,000 are homeless.
Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is meeting in Brasilia with governors of both states and has promised to facilitate emergency funds to help flood victims.
