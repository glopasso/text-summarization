Substitute Mario Balotelli scored a second-half equalizer to earn Inter Milan a 1-1 draw at Parma in their re-arranged Italian Serie A match on Wednesday.
Balotelli fired home from close range on the hour mark, just two minutes after coming off the bench, after the Parma defence failed to clear a corner.
On-loan Manchester City forward Valeri Bojinov had put the home side ahead in the 54th minute, the goal also coming from a corner that was not cleared properly.
Parma played the final 18 minutes with just 10 men after having Francesco Valiani dismissed for a second yellow card.
Inter are now unbeaten in nine matches and have increased their lead at the top of the table to nine points from Roma, with city rivals AC Milan another two points further back in third place.
