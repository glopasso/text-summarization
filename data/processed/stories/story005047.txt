Two men are in custody in connection with the death of a 16-month-old boy shot while his father pushed his stroller across a Brooklyn street, authorities said Friday.
The father, Anthony Hennis, 21, was pushing Antiq Hennis in his stroller near their home on Sunday evening. The child was shot in the left side of his head, according to police.
New York detectives and U.S. marshals apprehended the two men Friday morning at a Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, apartment according to NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly.
Daquan Breland, 23, and Daquan Wright, 19, are awaiting extradition back to New York. Because they have not been charged, police said they don't know whether they have attorneys.
Both men have some kind of relationship with the young boy's father, who has declined to be interviewed, according to Kelly.
Breland is on parole for a felony assault in upstate New York, according to police.
An eyewitness said Breland opened fire after Wright handed him a gun, according to Kelly, who did not cite a possible motive.
The shooting came two days after a Georgia jury convicted an 18-year-old man of murder in the shooting of a 1-year-old baby in a stroller in the coastal city of Brunswick.
De'Marquise Elkins faces a mandatory life sentence in the March 21 killing of Antonio Santiago. The child's mother said Elkins shot her and the baby after demanding money.
