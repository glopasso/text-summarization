A court in Mumbai on Thursday found four men guilty of gang-raping a photojournalist in the Indian city last year.
The woman, who was 22 at the time, and a male colleague were on assignment in the area for a print publication in August when some men approached them, according to police.
The two had walked from a train station to a nearby mill, the woman said in a statement released by police. One of the men claimed to be a railway employee and said, "Our boss has seen you taking photos; you will have to come with us."
According to the woman, he refused to let her talk to his boss, instead leading them away. Then, somewhere near the exit, one of the accused pointed at the photojournalist's colleague, saying he was responsible for a killing a few days ago.

"I pleaded with them to let us go, but they shouted at me and threatened me," the woman said. She and her colleague were taken further inside the mill complex.
There, they offered their camera and phone, begging to be let go. Instead, "they tied my friend's hands with (a) belt" as two others joined the group, the woman said.
"Three people stayed with my friend, and the two took me behind a wall," she added.
That's where the attack allegedly occurred. The victim said her mother called her phone multiple times, before one of the men switched it off. The woman said she was threatened with, among other things, sharp pieces of a broken beer bottle.
A fifth suspect who was arrested in connection with the case -- believed to be a teenager -- will be tried separately in a juvenile court.
The four men will be sentenced on Friday.
