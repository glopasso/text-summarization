A fan of Dutch football team Ajax is in a serious condition in hospital after falling from the stands of the club's Amsterdam ArenA stadium on Tuesday.
The fan is said to have fallen while celebrating Ajax's second goal, scored by Danny Hoesen, during a 2-1 European Champions League win over Barcelona.
Amsterdam Police confirmed on Twitter that the supporter who had fallen approximately five meters and had been taken to hospital where he was in a serious condition.
From the same account the police later denied social media rumors that the fan had died.
The Ajax press office was not immediately available for comment, though the club's Twitter feed sent the fan its best wishes.
Pictures on social media appear to show the man lying motionless in a pool of blood.
The incident comes days after a similar event at the Oakland Raiders vs. Tennessee Titans National Football League game on Sunday.
A 61-year-old Marine veteran used his body to break the fall of a woman who had seemingly thrown herself from the third level of the Oakland Coliseum.
The woman suffered a head wound while the man sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
European football's governing body UEFA stipulates that all Champions League matches must be played in all-seater stadia.
Ten-man Ajax's win over Barcelona handed the Catalans their first defeat under coach Gerardo Martino.
After beating Celtic in Glasgow AC Milan remain second in Group H with nine points behind Barca, who have already qualified for the knockout stages, but Ajax are now only one point behind the Italian side on eight.
The Dutch side will qualify for the last 16 if they can beat Milan at the San Siro stadium in the final round of Group H matches on December 11.
