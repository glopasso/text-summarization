(CNN)Jeweler Tiffany & Co., for the first time, is featuring a gay couple in an ad campaign.
The new "Will You?" campaign, shot by fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh, features seven scenes of couples.
One in particular is drawing widespread praise for showing a same-sex couple.
The pair, shown sitting on a stoop in New York City, are a couple in real life, Tiffany spokeswoman Linda Buckley said.
The 178-year-old jeweler best known for its little blue boxes says this is its first ad to depict a same-sex couple. The company joins a growing list of brands using same-sex couples in promotional materials, from Banana Republic to Target.
The campaign aims to show that love comes in a variety of forms, Buckley said.
"Nowadays, the road to marriage is no longer linear," she said. "True love can happen more than once with love stories coming in a variety of forms."
Another photo shows a couple on their wedding day with their child, the company said, a nod to increasing rates of mothers giving birth outside of marriage. The rest of the images show couples in various romantic settings: on a city rooftop, driving in a convertible, at home on a sofa.
