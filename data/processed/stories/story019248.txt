(EW.com) -- Chris Renaud, the codirector of "Despicable Me," turns the 1971 Dr. Seuss book into "The Lorax," a candy-colored feel-good anticonsumerist musical.
It's got a winningly whimsical Seussian spirit, though it could have used a pinch of his doggerel-driven anarchy. (Seuss' brilliantly playful language? Not there.) Zac Efron nicely voices Ted, a boy who wonders why there are no trees in Thneedville.
His foray outside the city walls leads him to the Once-ler (Ed Helms), a hipster who found a paradise of trees that look like furry lollipops, then cut them all down to get rich.
The movie is like a less original "WALLâ€¢E," but it's still vibrant and touching. B+
