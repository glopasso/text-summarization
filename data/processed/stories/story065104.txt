You had to feel sorry for the home team when host country Brazil got trounced 7-1 by Germany in their World Cup final match on Tuesday.
Unless you're Twitter. If you're Twitter, it was open season on the hapless squad, and the more brutally funny you were about the shocking blowout, the better.
We've rounded up some of our favorites, but are sure we didn't see them all. If you saw a particularly successful shot on goal -- and there was no shortage of those Tuesday -- share it with us in the comments below.
Our favorite zings centered around a few themes (out of appreciation for our German friends, no World War II material will be included, though there was plenty). They included ...

@ditzkoff  At 7 goals, the World Cup scoreboard just goes to the Donkey Kong kill screen
One (sarcastic) silver lining
@bjnovak And the saddest part is there's probably no fun ways to cheer yourself up in Brazil
