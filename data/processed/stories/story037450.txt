Rory McIlroy left South Korea in "good shape" after finishing joint second at the Kolon Korean Open.
The former world No.1 is still searching for an elusive first title of 2013 -- something his tennis star girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki finally managed to achieve on Sunday.
The 24-year-old golfer was left wondering what might have been as he finished just one stroke behind champion Kang Sung-Hoon after carding a four under round of 67 Sunday.
McIlroy sunk an eagle, four birdies and a bogey at the Woo Jeong Hills Country Club in Cheonan near Seoul.
"I could have shot anything, absolutely anything," said McIlroy.
"I only missed two greens and had so many chances, but it was like the story of yesterday -- I just didn't hole enough putts.
"I created so many more chances that it could have been 61, 62. It just wasn't to be.
"A little frustrating, but I'm happy with how I hit it. I hit the ball really well off the tee and my iron play was very solid as well.
"I feel like my game is in good shape going into the next few weeks, and that's a good thing."
Kang said he felt "horrible" after winning the title at the expense of his good friend and overnight leader Kim Hyung-Tae.
Kim had a four stroke lead going into the final day but received a two stroke penalty for grounding his club in a hazard at the 13th.
Kim and Kang, playing partners on Sunday, spent two hours reviewing TV footage with officials before Kim was persuaded to sign for a six by the Korean Golf Association rules committee.
"I'm a really good friend of him so at the moment it doesn't feel great," said Kang.
"Even though I won the tournament, I just feel really sorry for him. I was actually out there to celebrate for him, but ... I don't know ... I don't know what to say. It's horrible.
"[It's] hard to celebrate in these circumstances."
