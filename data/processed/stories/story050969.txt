Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)   -- A suspected U.S. drone strike killed four suspected militants in northwestern Pakistan on Monday night, Pakistani intelligence officials told CNN.
The unmanned Predator drone fired two missiles at a vehicle driving on a main road in North Waziristan, one of seven districts in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region along the Afghan border, the two officials said. The officials asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
North Waziristan is the home base of the Pakistani Taliban and described by Washington as a safe haven for militant groups fueling the insurgency across the border in Afghanistan.
The attack occurred roughly an hour after locals ended their daily fast for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Based on a count by CNN's Islamabad bureau, Monday's drone strike was the 48th this year, compared to 111 last year.
