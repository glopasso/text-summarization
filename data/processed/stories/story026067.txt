Germany's Julia Gorges upset world number one Caroline Wozniacki in straight sets 7-6 (7-3) 6-3 in Sunday's final of the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart.
The 22-year-old German stunned the Dane with an impeccable display on the clay, sending down 38 winners to become the first home winner since Anke Huber 17 years ago.
"I don't quite know how I did it. Against Caroline, it is always as if you have to climb a high mountain. Now I have done it, I can't quite believe it," Gorges said, AFP reported.
It was Gorges' second title of her career -- she won the 2010 Bad Gastein trophy -- and means she will now break into the world's top 30 for the first time.
Wozniacki started the day looking to add to the titles she has already won in 2011 at events in Dubai, Indian Wells and Charleston.
But the 20-year-old couldn't compete with Gorges' strong serve and crisp baseline shots on the day, managing only nine winners during the match.
"Julia played really well. She was very aggressive and everything was going in. I tried everything but it wasn't enough. I'll go back to the practice court and try to be better next time," Wozniacki said, AFP reported.
It was Wozniacki's second final defeat of 2011 after she lost to Russia's Vera Zvonareva at the Qatar Ladies Open in Doha at the end of February.
Meanwhile at the Fes Grand Prix in Morocco, Italy's Alberta Brianti clinched her first WTA Tour title by beating Romania's Simona Halep 6-4 6-3 in the final on Sunday.
Brianti need just one hour and 17 minutes to defeat seventh seed Halep, who also lost in last year's final.
The 31-year-old Brianti broke Halep's serve twice in the first set and three more times in the second as the 19-year-old struggled for consistency on her serve all match.
The Italian's previous best result on the WTA Tour was runner-up at the International Women's Open in Guangzhou in 2009.
