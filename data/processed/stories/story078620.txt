A trio of wildfires burned through Southern California on Tuesday, threatening homes, shutting down roads and prompting some residents to evacuate, officials said.
There were no reports of injuries from the three fires in Camarillo, Walnut and at Camp Pendleton.
Capt. Ron Oatman of the Ventura County Fire Department estimated the fire in Camarillo -- about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles -- to be about 15-20 acres.
Oatman said some homes were threatened, but residents were not yet evacuating.
In Walnut, 25 miles east of Los Angeles, a 5-acre wildfire prompted residents in 24 homes to evacuate, though the fire was later extinguished without burning any structures, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
Meanwhile, fire officials at Camp Pendleton -- home to a U.S. Marine Corps base north of San Diego -- had that blaze 60 percent contained Tuesday evening after it burned 2,700 acres. Firefighters expect to have it fully controlled Wednesday, according to a statement from the base.
The Camp Pendleton fire, which started Tuesday morning during a training exercise, forced the closure of at least one road that will remain closed through the night, the statement said.
