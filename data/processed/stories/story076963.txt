Millions of BlackBerry users in Europe, the Middle East and Africa were reportedly without Web and texting service Monday because of an outage that BlackBerry maker Research in Motion said it was investigating.
"We apologize to any of our customers in Europe, Middle East & Africa still experiencing issues. We'll bring you an update as soon as we can," read the message from @blackberryhelp on Twitter.
A statement provided by Research in Motion basically said the same thing. The company did not respond to CNN's questions about the cause of the outage, the number of users affected or an estimate of when service would be restored.
London's The Telegraph was reporting that all of the affected areas are served by a data server in Slough in southern England.
On its support Twitter feed, T-Mobile UK told customers the outage had knocked out service to "everyone" in the affected area and that BlackBerry Messenger and Web service were "having issues on all networks."
The network told customers it had not been given details about the cause of the outage, but that Research In Motion was looking in to it.
Other carriers were telling customers much the same, saying the problem is on BlackBerry's end.
"RIM has advised us that they're working to resolve the issue as a matter of urgency," a UK-based Vodafone spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires.
The BlackBerry remains hugely popular throughout Europe and the Middle East, where many international business users prize the phones for their vaunted security features.
British and European media were counting the number of people affected by Monday's outage in the millions. In July, BlackBerry reported it had added 1 million customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa market in less than three weeks.
