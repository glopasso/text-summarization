Red Bull Formula One driver Mark Webber has revealed in his newly-published autobiography that he drove the final four races of last season with a broken shoulder.
The Australian, who was in contention to win his first world championship right up to the final race in Abu Dhabi, sustained the fracture in a mountain bike accident prior to the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka in early October.
And despite needing pain-killing injections ahead of the Japanese and Korean Grands Prix, Webber decided to keep the injury secret from Red Bull principal Christian Horner.
In the book, entitled 'Webber up front', the 34-year-old wrote: "I was riding with a great friend of mine. Suddenly, he crashed right in front of me and I had nowhere to go but straight through the handlebars.
"I suffered what they call a skier's fracture to my right shoulder," he added.
Webber, who went on to finish second behind teammate and eventual world champion Sebastian Vettel in Japan, continued: "Suzuka is a brutal track so it was a blessing that the Japanese weather gave me an enforced rest day on the Saturday when qualifying was rained off.
"A pre-race cortisone injection helped me too and, in the end, we got through the weekend all right," he added.
Although Webber has not blamed the shoulder injury for failing to lift the world title, his fortunes faded over the final three races.
He failed to finish in Korea and his second place in Brazil meant he went into the final race in Abu Dhabi behind Fernando Alonso in the title chase.
