(CNN)Ah, um, that referee at the college football national championship sure looked familiar -- but no, it wasn't Bob Newhart.
During the Ohio State-Oregon matchup -- officially known as the College Football Playoff National Championship Presented by AT&T -- Twitter started buzzing over head referee Greg Burks, who looks suspiciously like comedy's favorite stammering phone caller, Chicago psychologist and Vermont innkeeper.
The attention got back to Newhart himself, who chimed in to set the record straight -- sort of.
Newhart wasn't the only lookalike at the game. Michael Strahan noticed that Oregon defensive coordinator Don Pellum looked like Coolio.
Newhart and Coolio? Something like that would be, uh, paradise.
Incidentally, Ohio State won, 42-20.
