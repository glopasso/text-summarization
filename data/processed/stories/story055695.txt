(Rolling Stone) -- Bob Dylan will release the ninth volume of his "Bootleg Series" on October 19, he has announced, confirming recent rumors.
This edition will be the first official collection of the Witmark Demos, 47 songs that Dylan recorded between 1962 and 1964 for his first two publishers, Leeds Music and M. Witmark & Sons.
The tracks -- which Dylan performed with only acoustic guitar, harmonica and some piano, all before he was 24 -- include early versions of classics like "Blowin' in the Wind," "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" and "The Times They Are A-Changin'," plus 15 more recorded exclusively for the sessions, including "Ballad for a Friend," "The Death of Emmett Till" and "Guess I'm Doing Fine."
The deluxe set will feature a booklet of photos from those sessions and in-depth liner notes by Colin Escott.
Also on October 19th, Columbia/Legacy will also release "Bob Dylan" -- "The Original Mono Recordings," which feature Dylan's first eight LPs newly mastered from their first-generation mono mixes. The set -- which spans 1962's Bob Dylan through 1968's "John Wesley Harding" -- will come as a deluxe box and on 180-gram vinyl, and include a booklet of vintage photographs and an essay by Rolling Stone.
