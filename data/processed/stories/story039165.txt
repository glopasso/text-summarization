One student was transported to a local hospital with an injury that was not life-threatening, said Jody Duncan, a spokeswoman for EMA-MetroSafe.
Before the suspect was located and taken into custody, she described him as male, "about 6-foot-5, wearing a gray hoodie, black pants with a gray stripe and about 15 or 16 years old."
"We're not sure if he is a student at Fern Creek High School, but we do know that he's a younger individual," Duncan said.
