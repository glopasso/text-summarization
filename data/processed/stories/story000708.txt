More than 15 million surge protectors are being recalled for posing a potential fire hazard, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the manufacturer announced Thursday.
Seven hundred instances of APC SurgeArrest devices overheating or melting have been reported, according to a press release from the safety commission. Thirteen people were hurt and 55 claims were made for damage caused by smoke and fire.
The recall includes corded surge protectors manufactured before 2003 by Schneider Electric IT Corporation.
"The affected products may present a fire hazard under infrequent, abnormal building wiring and electrical conditions," the company said. "This hazard has been reported in a small percentage (less than 0.01%) of the units sold and included reports of property damage, mostly involving damaged nylon carpeting."
Thirty-two model numbers of the company's "7 series" and "8 series" devices are included in the recall and can be found on the company's website, recall.apc.com, or by calling 888 437 4007
The safety commission urges the public to stop using the surge protectors, and to contact the company for a replacement.
