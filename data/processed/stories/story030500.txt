Another "Real Housewives" divorce is on the way.
"Real Housewives of Atlanta" star Phaedra Parks is calling it quits with husband Apollo Nida. The couple's relationship has taken a bumpy turn of late because of Nida's legal issues and prison sentence.
According to Parks' representative, the mom of two has "retained an attorney with the intent of amicably ending her marriage."
The news comes a month after Nida reported to prison to begin an eight-year federal sentence for a fraud conviction. The reality star pleaded guilty in May to charges in a fraud scheme that federal prosecutors say stole millions of dollars from at least 50 people over four years.
Nida, 35, must also serve five years under parole supervision after he completes his prison stint. He is being held at the minimum-security federal prison in Lexington, Kentucky.
This is Nida's second prison sentence; he served five years for auto title fraud before marrying Parks in 2009.
The pair joined the hit Bravo series in 2010, and have been lead participants since. The troubled couple play a big part in the show's upcoming seventh season, if the trailer is anything to go by.
In July, Nida told Atlanta radio station B100 he had doubts his marriage to Parks would continue. "I mean, my wife didn't even ... show up for my sentencing, so I'm still kind of salty about that," Nida said.
At the time of Nida's sentencing, Parks' publicist released a statement on her behalf. "Phaedra is now putting all of her energy into ensuring the well-being of her two children and making decisions that are in their best interests," the statement said. "This situation has put a tremendous strain on Phaedra and her family, and she is working hard to bring back a sense of normalcy to everyone's lives."
The former couple has two sons, Ayden, 4, and Dylan, 1.
