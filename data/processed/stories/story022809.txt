The stepmother of a disabled girl whose remains were found after she went missing in North Carolina has been indicted on a bigamy charge.
Elisa Baker, the stepmother of Zahra Baker, 10, is accused of marrying the girl's father before divorcing her previous husband, a Catawaba County court official said Tuesday.
The family made international news late last year after the freckled-faced young girl went missing from their home in Hickory, North Carolina.
The girl lost part of her left leg at age 5 and lost hearing in both ears while being treated for cancer.
Police found Zahra's remains on November 11, just over a month after she was reported missing.
Elisa Baker was charged with obstruction of justice after she admitted to planting a fake ransom note.
Documents released after Zahra's remains were found tell a grisly story.
The stepmother told police the girl was killed two weeks before she was reported missing, according to search warrants.
She said the disabled girl's body was dismembered and disposed of in various locations, documents show.
A search warrant dated October 27 shows police were looking for latex gloves used to dismember Zahra and trash bags used to store the remains.
No one has been directly charged in the girl's death.
