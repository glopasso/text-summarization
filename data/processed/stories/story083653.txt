Britney Spears is about to hit the Strip.
The singer has announced that she will do a two-year residency at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas with a show titled "Britney: Piece of Me."

Audiences of all ages will be thrilled as Britney re-imagines her greatest past performances and offers a glimpse of brand new material from her highly-anticipated eighth studio album."
