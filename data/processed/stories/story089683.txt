Ferrari's plans to unveil their new car for the 2012 Formula One season have been scuppered by heavy snowfall at the Italian team's Maranello factory.
The legendary marque had planned to showcase the new car, which they hope will win them a first drivers' championship since 2007, on Friday.
"There was no let up from the snow last night, which continued to fall on Maranello and the surrounding area and the situation does not appear to be changing this morning," the team told the sport's official website.
