(EW.com) -- NBC has ordered a second season of "The Blacklist," its hit drama that stars James Spader as a world-renowned terrorist.
The Peacock picked up 22 more episodes of the series that ranks as No. 1 drama on the Big 4 nets in the 18-49 demo, averaging a 4.9 rating/13 share. It is the No. 2 scripted series on the Big 4 in the 18-49 demo, and the No. 1 new show in 18-49 and total viewers.
"The success of The Blacklist demonstrates that inspired storytelling is alive and well in broadcast television, and I'm impressed on a daily basis by this creative team's imagination and the extent to which they will go to capture this grand vision on film," said NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt in a statement. "With gratitude to both our partners at Sony Pictures Television and our NBC development executives who took a great script and shepherded it into a great series, I hope that Red Reddington never runs out of names to bring down on his list!"
In historical context, NBC says The Blacklist is NBC's most-watched new drama eight weeks into its run in 19 years (since Earth 2 in 1994). The series also stars Megan Boone, Diego Klattenhoff, Harry Lennix, Ryan Eggold and Parminder Nagra.
