(CNN)Fine starts to 2015 for world number one Rory McIlroy and his arch-rival Rickie Fowler, a superb 64 from first round leader Martin Kaymer and aces for England's Tom Lewis and Spanish veteran Miguel Angel Jimenez.
The first day of the HSBC Abu Dhabi Championship Thursday was nothing but eventful as a top class field jostled for position at the top of the leader board.
Most eyes were on the partnership of McIlroy and his American rival Fowler, teeing off early at  Abu Dhabi GC, and they did not disappoint, both carding five-under rounds of 67.
But last year's U.S. Open champion Kaymer, a three-time winner at the venue, later upstaged them with a blistering eight-under 64, which included 10 birdies, a personal best for him, he told the official European Tour website.
"I putted well. I made 10 birdies. I'm not sure if I have ever done it on a golf course, hit 10 birdies. I hit a lot of fairways, my irons were quite sharp and I putted well. It's very difficult to shoot a bad score when you play like this.
His late charge denied Belgium's Thomas Pieters (65) the honor of first day leadership, while there was a five-strong group on 66, consisting of Branden Grace, Gregory Bourdy, Tyrell Hatton, Alexander Levy and Mikko Ilonen.
McIlroy, looking to add to his two majors of last year in 2015, made a slow start but a rally on his back nine, with five birdies in six holes, left him in a challenging position.
There was no doubting the shots of the day, which came from young gun Lewis and the 51-year-old Jimenez, who aced the seventh and 15th holes respectively.
Lewis won a luxury car for his effort, while Jiminez was left to celebrate the eighth hole-in-one of his European Tour career.
It's very nice when you make a hole in one. I'm happy I finished level par today." he said later.
