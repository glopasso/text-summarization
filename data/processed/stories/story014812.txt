Singer-songwriter Katy Perry will lend her "distinctive talents, style and personality" to the virtual world of The Sims through an extensive collaboration with Electronic Arts, the computer game company said Tuesday.
"I always like to think of myself as a cartoon, and now I'm a Sim," Perry said in the news release announcing the deal.
Perry has been a Sims fan for several years, Electronic Arts Worldwide Executive of Music Steve Schnur said.
"No performer could better represent the humor and fun of The Sims brand," Schnur said.
Perry's hit "Hot and Cold," featured in The Sims 2 series, is the most popular Simlish music video, he said.
"The Sims Studio plans to develop multiple games within The Sims franchise featuring special Katy Perry themed in-game content and virtual goods," the company said. "The relationship kicks off with a special collector's edition for The Sims 3 Showtime, launching in March 2012. Katy Perry will also be featured in all-new advertising and marketing campaigns for the brand."
Perry will help design Sims game accessories, clothing, hairstyles, furniture and props "that truly celebrate the imagination that she brings to her performances, music videos and life," the company said.
She will also be featured in TV ads, online and retail marketing for Sims products, it said.
"I love how you're able to play out different stories through your Sims characters -- giving them different careers and watching them succeed," Perry said. "It's cool to see the Sims' stage performances in The Sims 3 Showtime decked out just like my California Dreams Tour -- even my cotton candy video screens are in there."
