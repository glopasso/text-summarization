Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor returned home Saturday from a Los Angeles hospital a day after she was rushed there by ambulance for a swollen leg, her husband said.
Paramedics initially suspected Gabor suffered from a blood clot in her left leg, but an emergency room doctor at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center later determined she had an infection, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt said Saturday.
The 93-year-old actress spent several weeks at the same hospital after hip replacement surgery in July.
She has been frail and "pretty much confined to a wheelchair" since a 2002 car accident, Von Anhalt said. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles.
The Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders.
Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, "Moulin Rouge;" "The Story of Three Loves" in 1953; "The Girl in the Kremlin" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, "Touch of Evil."
