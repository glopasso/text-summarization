At least two carriages of a passenger train fell into a river Thursday after floods destroyed a bridge in southwest China's Sichuan Province, state-run CCTV reported Friday, citing Chengdu Railway authorities.
It was not immediately known how many passengers were inside the carriages, which a firefighter said were swept 200 meters downriver. Local authorities said they were doing their best to carry out rescues.
The accident occurred in Guanghan at about 3:20 p.m. Thursday on the Shi-ting-jiang Bridge, part of the railway line that links Chengdu and Baoji, in northwestern Shaanxi Province.
Floods caused the bridge piers to collapse, which forced the train from its track, they said.
People aboard five other carriages were taken to safety.
The train was traveling from Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, to Kunming, the capital of southwestern Yunnan Province.
