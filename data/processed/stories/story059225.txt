(Rolling Stone) -- Michael Jackson's blockbuster album "Bad" will be reissued in a deluxe edition on September 18 to mark the record's 25th anniversary.
The set, titled "Bad 25," will features three CDs, a DVD and two booklets. The DVD will include Jackson's personal video recording of his performance at Wembley Stadium in London on July 16, 1988. The video will be the first full concert performance from the Bad tour to be commercially released, and will be seen without cuts, exactly as it played out on stage before an audience of 72,000 fans, including Princess Diana.
A CD featuring professionally recorded audio from the Wembley concert will also be included, along with a remastered version of the original "Bad" album. A third CD will feature previously unreleased demos of songs that did not make it to the album, along with new remixes of material from "Bad."
A standard edition of the "Bad" reissue will also be released, including the remastered album and unreleased material, but omitting the Wembley performance.
