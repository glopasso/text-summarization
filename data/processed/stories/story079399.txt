ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Prosecutors will seek the death penalty against three men accused in connection with the July death of former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, officials said Tuesday.
Former boxing champion Vernon Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta, Georgia, on July 25.
A grand jury indicted the three suspects -- Charman Sinkfield, 30; Demario Ware, 20; and Jquante Crews, 25 -- on charges including murder, felony murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Fulton County Superior Court spokesman Don Plummer said in a statement.
Forrest, 38, was shot and killed in southwest Atlanta on July 25. He had stopped at a gas station to put air in his tire, Plummer said, and was robbed at gunpoint of his championship ring and Rolex watch.
"Forrest chased the robber, believed to be Demario Ware, and then lost sight of him as he escaped into a nearby public housing complex," Plummer said. "Forrest then encountered the accused triggerman, Charman Sinkfield, not far from the scene of the armed robbery. As he turned to walk away from the man, Forrest was shot seven times."
Crews is accused of being the getaway driver, Plummer said.
Forrest was the International Boxing Federation welterweight champion in 2001, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion in 2002-03, and the WBC light welterweight champion in 2007-08 and 2008-09, according to the BoxRec Web site. He was named the World Boxing Hall of Fame fighter of the year in 2002, the Web site said.
A $17,000 reward has been offered for the return of the watch and ring, Plummer said. The watch has a black leather band and diamonds, and his championship ring is engraved with his name and four X's signifying his four championship wins.
