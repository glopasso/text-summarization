Crowdfunding and high-tech innovation were made for each other.
With the emergence of sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, inventors with an idea, but not much cash, have been able to skip traditional business models and go straight to consumers who are excited to be part of something new and exciting.
Pebble, the first widely available smartwatch, cleared $10.2 million on the site. Ouya, an affordable game console running Android, cleared $8.6 million. Virtual-reality system Oculus Rift got a $2.4 million start, and rock legend Neil Young turned to Kickstarter to fund Pono, a high-quality digital music player, to the tune of $6.2 million.
But, let's face it, not every gadget offered for your approval is ready for prime time. That's not saying some of them aren't really cool, or don't have an audience that will enjoy them. But Apple and Samsung probably won't race to be the first to market with a brick-lifting pencil or frying pan that looks like something off the "Game of Thrones" set.
Take a look at our seven favorite, quirky gadgets that have had good luck on Kickstarter.
