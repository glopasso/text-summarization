Radamel Falcao scored a first-half hat-trick as Atletico Madrid thrashed Chelsea 4-1 in the European Super Cup in Monaco on Friday.
Falcao opened his account in the sixth minute with a clever chip over goalkeeper Petr Cech before guiding a left-foot shot into the top-left corner to make it 2-0 with just 19 minutes on the clock.
The Colombian striker scored his third in the dying moments of the first half smashing the ball past a helpless Cech to finish off a counter-attack to all but end the English club's interest in the tie.
Any hopes of a comeback were snuffed out 15 minutes after the restart when Miranda expertly put away a fourth.
Champion's League winners, Chelsea were second best all night against Europa League victors Atletico, but they did manage a consolation goal 16 minutes before the final whistle when defender Gary Cahill fired home.
"We've got a lot to learn, we've got to get a lot better. It's a shame we were not able to be as competitive in a European final," Chelsea coach, Roberto di Matteo said.
"It was a bad defeat, but we'll bounce back," he added.
