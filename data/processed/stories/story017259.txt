Former Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf defended Pakistan's role in the fight against terrorism amid criticisms that it falls short on that front.
"Pakistan has always been accused of not doing enough. But I totally disagree with this statement. Pakistan is doing enough," Musharraf said in an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's "This Week."
A private White House report to Congress, obtained by CNN last week, used unusually tough language to suggest the ally is not doing nearly enough to confront the Taliban and al Qaeda. The blunt language contradicted public comments by the Obama administration that Pakistan is working hard to crack down on militants.
The report notes that from March to June, the Pakistani military "continued to avoid military engagements that would put it in direct conflict with Afghan Taliban or [al Qaeda] forces in North Waziristan. This is as much a political choice as it is a reflection of an under-resourced military prioritizing its targets."
Musharraf said that if critics want to point out deficiencies in North Waziristan, they should limit their comments to just that region.
"But don't generalize the statement that the army is not doing enough. They've suffered over 2,000 casualties. What do you mean by not doing enough?" he said.
Pakistan has its problems, he said, but should not be blamed for its effort.
"We must understand the problems, but what hurts Pakistan and every leader in Pakistan is when they are blamed. Everyone in the world starts blaming them, while we are suffering casualties, we are suffering hundreds of people dying from bomb blasts and suicide bombs, and yet we are the rogues," Musharraf said.
Musharraf has been in self-imposed exile in London since he left office in 2008.
But he said he wants to return for a presidential run in 2013, because he sees suffering in Pakistan and doesn't see a political party offering a solution.
