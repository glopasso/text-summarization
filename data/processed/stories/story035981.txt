(EW.com ) -- The mother has a voice: Meg Ryan has been cast as the narrator for CBS' "How I Met Your Mother" spinoff.
EW: 'How I Met Your Mother' spinoff casts lead role
The actress has landed the unseen vocal role in the "How I Met Your Dad" pilot, which is considered an obvious front-runner for a series order for CBS' schedule next season. She'll supply the voice of "future Sally" (played during the series in flashback by Greta Gerwig), the same way Bob Saget supplied the voice for future Ted in "HIMYM." Like Saget, her character will never be seen.

Ryan is one of the original modern-day rom-com movie stars, having launched her career in 1989 with the hit "When Harry Met Sally." She's since appeared in "Sleepless in Seattle," "In the Cut," and had a recurring role on Showtime's "Web Therapy." "How I Met Your Dad" is her first major prime-time TV series regular role. CBS and studio 20th Century Fox TV had no comment.
