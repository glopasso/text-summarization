One person died and one person was wounded when an apparent altercation led to a shooting at a Seattle-area bar, police said Monday.
The shooting occurred just a few hours after the Seattle Seahawks won their way into the NFL playoffs. Several players and other celebrities were among hundreds of people gathered at Munchbar, a popular nightspot in Bellevue, Washington. No players were injured in the incident, which occurred just after 1 a.m. PT Monday.
Bellevue police said a 30-year-old man from Seattle was killed but did not identify him. Another man suffered a gunshot wound, police said.
Investigators are trying to determine how many suspects were involved in the incident.
"We have to talk to quite a few witnesses, so we're working with some of the witnesses who were closest to the situation," police spokeswoman Carla Iafrate told reporters.
Seahawks defensive end Greg Scruggs tweeted "I'm OK" and "Everybody else is good too! .. Ignorance at its best right there" after the shooting.
CNN affiliate KING reported that the players were in a VIP lounge and were escorted to a safe place after the incident.
The station also reported that Aubrey O'Day, who has appeared in several TV reality shows, tweeted that everyone in the players' group hit the floor when the gunfire erupted. In other tweets, she described how she saw a body and how people had to crawl out through the kitchen.
"I saw the guy laying on the floor and blood everywhere... Wasnt sure of his status," she said.
Bellevue police said there were about 600 people in the bar, and nearby officers immediately responded to reports of the shooting.
