(CNN)  -- Roger Federer will resume his rivalry with Australia's Lleyton Hewitt when the two tennis superstars play in the final of the Gerry Weber Open in Halle on Sunday.
Federer, who has an incredible 76-1 record on grass since 2003, reached his third ATP Tour final of the year with a 7-6 6-3 win over German Philipp Petzschner.
Earlier on Saturday, Hewitt beat another home hope as he battled past Benjamin Becker 6-7 7-6 6-2.
Nadal and Murray crash out at Queen's Club
Hewitt, who won Wimbledon in 2002 and held the world number one spot, will be meeting Federer for the 25th time, but he has lost the last 16 matches.
"He's obviously the best grass-court player around," Hewitt told the official ATP Tour Web site.
"It's a good test for me to go out there. I'm going to have to obviously play extremely well and execute what I want to do out there and try and put him under some kind of pressure."
Federer will be seeking his sixth title in Halle, his traditional warm-up event ahead of a tilt at his seventh Wimbledon crown.
Meanwhile, Mardy Fish will contest an all-American final against Sam Querrey in the other big grass warm-up tournament at Queen's Club in London.
Fish, who beat defending champion Andy Murray in the third round, saw off Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-3 6-4.
Lopez could not reproduce the form which saw him beat compatriot Rafael Nadal, the world number one and French Open champion in the quarters.
Querrey edged Germany's Rainer Schuettler 6-7 7-5 6-3 in the first semifinal.
