(CNN)  -- Away from the hustle and bustle of Delhi's dusty streets, where rickshaws, crammed buses and the occasional elephant usually set the tone for a cacophonous commuting experience, there is an air-conditioned haven that is the pride of local residents: The Delhi Metro.
Just eight years old, the Indian city's transport system has been hailed as a great success story -- its trains run on time, platforms are clean and journeys are quick.
The metro carries hundreds of thousands of daily commuters and has helped to reduce Delhi's massive traffic and air pollution problems.
Since the start of its first phase, it has saved around 300,000 tons of fuel, and its potential to reduce greenhouse emissions is "quite substantial," according to Anumita Roychowdhury of India's Center for Science and Environment.

With the city now gearing up to host the next Commonwealth Games in October 2010, the transport system is expanding to accommodate athletes, visitors and thousands of commuters.
