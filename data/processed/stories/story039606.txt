The wreckage of a C-130 cargo plane that disappeared shortly after takeoff in the southern Philippines Monday night was found Tuesday about two miles (3km) offshore, the Philippines News Agency reported.
Searchers have recovered items from the wreckage of the cargo plane.
The bodies of two of the nine crew members on board were recovered, the report said.
The Philippines Air Force plane was declared missing after the control tower at Davao International Airport lost radio contact with the pilot halfway between Manila and Davao, an Air Force official said.
The plane, with two pilots and seven crew members on board, was to have picked up members of the Presidential Security Group for transport to Manila.
The wreckage was found at 6am Tuesday by a search team just off the coast of Barangay, San Pedro Extension, Davao City, the news agency said.
