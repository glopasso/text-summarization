(CNN)Two Los Angeles police officers were wounded in gunfire late Sunday, and police told local media they believe the officers were targeted.
They were on duty in South L.A., when gunfire erupted in the early evening, grazing both of them, said Officer Cory Meisner.
They both sustained minor injuries and were treated at the scene. One of the officers had to have bullet fragments removed from his arm later, according to the LAPD.
The Los Angeles Times reported that the officers had been driving through the neighborhood dressed in plain clothes. The officers returned fire, and several suspects scattered, Det. Meghan Aguilar told the newspaper, adding that the officers believed that they were targeted.
But a public information officer for the LAPD disputes that possibility.
"The officers were in plain clothes," Rosario Herrera told CNN.  "This cannot be called targeting.  The narcotics officers from the 77th  division were driving in an unmarked police vehicle around 64th and Broadway when they were shot at and they returned fire."
Three individuals were detained for questioning, according to Herrera, but were not arrested.
The names of the injured officers have not been released.
