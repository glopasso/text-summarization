President Obama on Saturday asked Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to be his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, according to two White House officials.
Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius walks with Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal after meeting with the president this week.
The officials told CNN that Obama is expected to make the announcement Monday afternoon. The officials asked not to be named because the announcement has not yet been made.
Sebelius, who administration officials say Obama seriously considered to be his vice-presidential nominee, has been rumored to be a top contender for the job for weeks.
The post is still vacant after the first pick, former Sen. Tom Daschle, stepped aside after questions were raised about his failure to pay more than $100,000 in taxes for use of a car and driver.
CNN reported earlier this month that Sebelius met in Washington with senior White House adviser Valerie Jarrett about the job, a sign that the administration has been giving her a close look since Daschle dropped out.
The officials noted Sebelius has a good personal relationship with Obama and remained in the running for the vice presidential slot until near the end of the process. She was also considered for other Cabinet posts.
