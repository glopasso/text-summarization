An earthquake in central Oklahoma prompted a few calls to the police but no apparent damage Saturday.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary 4.5 magnitude to the quake and said it was centered near Jones, Oklahoma, 14 miles northeast of Oklahoma City.
The shaking lasted 3 to 5 seconds at 12:15 p.m. Central Time, said Oklahoma City police Lt. Jason Samuel. He said a few people called the department to ask what happened. No damage had been reported.
Samuel said the quake was strong enough to wake him from a nap at his home. He said it seemed stronger and longer-lasting that other earthquakes in the area in recent years.
Oklahoma had a stronger earthquake -- 5.6 magnitude -- on November 5, 2011. Although damage was not widespread, it did buckle U.S. Highway 62 in Lincoln County.
