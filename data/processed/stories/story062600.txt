Queensland's flood disaster fund received a massive boost on Sunday as the world's best tennis players turned out to raise money at a packed Rod Laver Arena, Melbourne.
The specially organized Rally for Relief raised nearly $2 million and counting as stars from the ATP and WTA tours gave up their time on the eve of the Australian Open.
Australian Open: From nomad to nouveau riche
Over 15,000 tennis fans turned up to the arena to watch the event and hundreds more watched on the big screen outside in Garden Square.
Players were split into two teams: "Gold," led by Lleyton Hewitt and "Green" captained by Queenslander Pat Rafter.
Hewitt's team included Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Ana Ivanovic, Justine Henin and Caroline Wozniacki, while Rafter led Rafa Nadal, Andy Roddick, Andy Murray, Victoria Azarenka, Vera Zvonareva and Kim Clijsters.
Two-time Australian Open champion Jim Courier presided over the matches from the umpire's chair.

The 90-minute exhibition was a light-hearted affair full of trick shots and lively banter as the players -- some wearing microphones -- laughed and joked with each other and the crowd.
The finale pitted Nadal and Clijsters against Federer and Samantha Stosur who played out a highly entertaining mixed doubles match.
Earlier Hewitt and Rafter went head-to-head in an all Australian clash - the first time they had played one another publicly since 2001.
