(EW.com) -- Fox has released a fall premiere date schedule that gets the jump on rivals.
With CBS and NBC mostly getting things going during the traditional late-September premiere week, Fox is launching eight shows at least one week earlier.
The return of "The X Factor" will kick things off on Sept. 11, then there are several new shows opening the following week, such as fantasy drama "Sleepy Hollow" and promising Andy Samberg comedy "Brooklyn Nine-Nine." Fox will hold a beat during the official start-of-the-season week of the 22nd â€” when CBS is firing its guns and NBC is dropping a few shows, as well. Then Fox will sprinkle the return of "The Simpsons," sci-fi drama "Almost Human" and other titles over the following weeks. In addition to ducking rivals, the earlier launch also helps give Fox's shows another week on the air before those troublesome baseball preemptions kick in.
