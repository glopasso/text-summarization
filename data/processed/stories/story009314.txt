Scott Brown, the former senator from Massachusetts who moved to New Hampshire to run in a more friendly environment, appears to be in a dead heat with Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a new poll shows.
A CNN/ORC International poll out Monday finds Shaheen and Brown tied among likely voters, with both obtaining the support of 48% among 735 voters surveyed.
A close race could mean bad news for Democrats, who are struggling to maintain control of the Senate. Keeping the seat in the Democratic column is crucial if the party want to maintain a slim majority in the Senate.
One thing working in Shaheen's favor is her high favorable ratings. More than half of likely voters -- 54% -- have a favorable view of the first-term incumbent, while Brown's favorability is not as high. His rating currently sits at 46%.
What could be a drag on Shaheen, however, is New Hampshire residents' opinion of the leader of her party. Thirty-eight percent of New Hampshire adults polled approve of the job President Barack Obama is doing, while 60% disapprove. Throughout the campaign, Brown has sought to tie Shaheen to Obama.
The poll has a margin of error of plus or 3.5 percentage points.
