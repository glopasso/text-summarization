Some of us are lucky enough to live within a rogue inflatable ball's reach of the world's best beaches.
Some of us can paddle out for a ride on the greatest waves on a whim.
For those of us who live further inland, or prefer something less salty, there are still watery joys to be had, in the form of the world's best water parks.
Aquatica (Orlando, Florida)
One enormous wave pool obviously wasn't enough for the team behind Aquatica, so they built two, side by side.
Elsewhere, the Dolphin Plunge water slide takes passengers on a white-knuckle ride through a dolphin-filled aquarium and riders brave enough to take on the Omaka Rocka blast down a series of flumes and funnels.
There's a sandy beach covered with 1,360 tons of soft, white sand and South Seas-inspired gardens with more than 60,000 species of plants.

A lazy river and surf lessons in the park's wave pool offer slightly more sedate activities.

Away from the water, there's a rainforest with 50,000 plants, a hotel and a nightclub. It's even possible to go for a balloon ride -- all without stepping outside.
