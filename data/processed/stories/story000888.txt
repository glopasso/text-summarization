Formula One team Sauber will feature a message of support for the people of Japan on the livery of their cars at the opening grand prix of the season.
The Asian country was hit by a devastating earthquake and tsunami on Friday last week with over 5,000 people now confirmed to have died.
One of Sauber's drivers, Kamui Kobayashi, is a native of Japan and was born in the Hyogo prefecture.
He and Mexican Sergio Perez's cars will carry a message in Japanese at the Melbourne Grand Prix in Australia on March 27 that reads 'may our prayers reach the people in Japan.'
Sauber's team principal Peter Sauber told Formula One's official website it was important the team did something to demonstrate their support.
"It is difficult to find the right words to express our emotions and feelings, but silence means we can't even begin imagine how to try," he said.
"We can hardly believe what we are seeing. Our thoughts are with the people in Japan.
"We hope they will have the necessary strength to overcome these circumstances of extreme adversity."
