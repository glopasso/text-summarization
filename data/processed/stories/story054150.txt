Florida prosecutors have asked a judge to tighten conditions or revoke bond for Marissa Alexander, who faces a second trial for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband.
The Jacksonville woman was sentenced to 20 years in prison despite arguing before trial that her actions were justifiable under Florida's controversial "stand your ground" self-defense law.
She was released on $150,000 bond in November after an appellate court struck down her 2012 conviction.
In court papers filed Monday, prosecutors argued that Alexander "repeatedly flouted" the limits of her bond by running errands, taking shopping trips and taking relatives to the airport. Under the terms of her release, Alexander was only allowed to leave her home for medical emergencies, court appearances and other pretrial functions, they argued.
In a scathing response, Alexander's lawyers wrote Tuesday that each trip had been approved by the sheriff's official supervising her release. "Obviously, including those omitted facts would expose the frivolity of the state's motion," they wrote.
Alexander's case had drawn the attention of civil rights leaders, who say nobody was hurt and the sentence for the mother of three was too harsh.
Alexander said she was attempting to flee her husband on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her.
State Attorney Angela Corey had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because Alexander fired in the direction of a room where children were standing. Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence -- but Alexander chose to take her chances at trial, where a conviction would bring an enhanced sentence for the use of a firearm.
'Stand Your Ground' laws up to states, not Obama or Congress
