Fanatical Manchester United fan Usain Bolt has been offered the chance to fulfill a boyhood dream and turn out for the famous Red Devils.
The fastest man in the world has often spoken of his wish to play for the English Premier League giants and used his Twitter blog to badger United star Rio Ferdinand to get him a trial at Old Trafford.
Bolt was also a guest at United's EPL home game against Fulham and went on the pitch to show off his Olympic gold medals to the crowd.
Now manager Alex Ferguson has hinted Bolt could indeed turn out for the club.
"He's a bit of a character and a big United fan. But it's interesting he says he'd like to play in a charity game," Ferguson was quoted on their official website.
"It could be brilliant and next year, when we play Real Madrid's Legends again, there could be opportunities to bring him up and see how he does.
"The people from these small islands, like Dwight Yorke from Trinidad & Tobago, they all play football and he probably played at school level or youth level or something like that. It'd be nice to get him up here, I think it'll be good."
Bolt, who has won six Olympic gold medals in the last two Games, would certainly add pace to the United attack and in the past has been to their training ground to pass on his expertise.
"He's been to Carrington a couple of times," Ferguson added.
"And he did help Cristiano Ronaldo with his sprinting, like he said. He took him aside one day."
Ferguson is a big fan of the Jamaican, describing his performances at the London Games as "phenomenal."
Bolt could take heart from the feats of one of his British opponents in the 100m at the 2012 Olympics.
World junior champion Adam Gemili narrowly missed out on running against him in the final, having turned to athletics after playing professional football for fourth flight Dagenham and Redbridge.
Britain's former Decathlon legend Daley Thompson also had trials with now EPL Reading at the end of his athletics career.
