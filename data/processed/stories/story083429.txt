History and botany mix with landscape design and architecture in these 13 fabulous gardens around the world.
While many are attached to famous estates, the gardens are destinations in their own right and deserve their own list.
Parc de la Tête d'Or (Lyon, France)
This beautifully maintained 289-acre park in Lyon has an extensive botanical garden but is best known for its spectacular rose gardens, which are playing host to the 17th World Rose Convention and Festival in 2015.
The park's main highlight is the International Rose Garden, with its 16,000 rose bushes showcasing 450 varieties, while the Competition Rose Garden hosts an annual contest featuring the newest varieties.
Fun fact: the park's name, which means "Golden Head Park," comes from an old legend about the grounds about buried treasure. The Crusaders are supposed to have buried a golden Christ's head somewhere on the park's property.
Parc de la Tête d'Or, 69006 Lyon, France; +33 4 72 69 47 60; free admission
Butchart Gardens (British Columbia, Canada)
When Jennie Butchart's husband, a manufacturer of Portland cement, told her in 1904 that his company had exhausted the limestone in their quarry, the door was opened to create what would later become one of Canada's notable tourist attractions.
Butchart Gardens near Victoria in British Columbia were created within that disused quarry.
Featured views include the Edwardian-style Sunken Garden (gallery above), with a lake where reflections of multi-colored foliage surrounding it take on a beauty of their own.

Hershey Gardens (Pennsylvania)
When chocolate magnate Milton S. Hershey decided to create a thing of beauty to be enjoyed by residents of "his" town in Pennsylvania, the result was Hershey Gardens, opened in 1937.
A notable feature is the Butterfly House, home to hundreds of North American butterflies, in which visitors can observe the entire life cycle of the butterfly, from egg to adult.
There are 11 themed gardens on site, including the whimsical Children's Garden and a rose garden with nearly 6,000 roses of 275 varieties.

The Temperate House is the world's largest surviving Victorian glass structure.
An iron-framed greenhouse dating from the 19th century, it was to become a model for conservatories around the world.

Roseto Comunale (Rome)
Rome's municipal rose garden at the foot of Aventine Hill has a complicated past.
Since the 17th century, the site had been a Jewish cemetery, but a road was built through it in 1934 to celebrate Mussolini's rise to power. While all graves were supposed to have been moved to the city's main cemetery, thousands of bodies are still thought to remain.
The city turned the site into a rose garden in 1950 with the Jewish community's approval, designing the paths in the shape of a menorah, a Hebrew candelabra, and installing a plaque in memorandum of the garden's Jewish past.
Each May, the garden hosts the "Premio Roma" rose competition, which is open to the public.
Roseto Comunale, Via di Valle Murcia, 6 (Aventine), Rome; +39 06 5746810; free admission
Garden Kingdom Dessau-Woerlitz (Dessau, Germany)
"I was deeply moved as we strolled through the lakes, canals and woods by how the gods have allowed the Prince to create a dream around himself."
That's how Johann Wolfgang von Goethe described this place -- then called Luisium Castle Garden -- in 1778.
Now known as the Garden Kingdom Dessau-Woerlitz in Germany, it was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000.
The Snake House, so called because of the shape of its gutters, was a retreat for Louise, the wife of Prince Franz of Anhalt-Dessau.

Egeskov Castle Garden (Funen, Denmark)
Egeskov Castle is a beautifully preserved Renaissance structure dating back to 1554.
Covering 20 hectares, the original old grounds have been divided into a number of impressive gardens that won the European Garden Award in 2012.
Among the gardens are four 270-years-old, eight-meter-tall hedge mazes, so visitors should allow time for getting lost.

Christchurch Botanic Gardens (Christchurch, New Zealand)
Founded in 1863 with the planting of an English Oak and now featuring many trees more than 120 years old, the Botanic Gardens in Christchurch, New Zealand, survived the city's major earthquake in 2011 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2013.
A quintessential experience, reminiscent of England, is to pole a boat along the River Avon through the gardens.
The Gondwana Garden is the beginning of a new feature on site -- a recreation of a Jurassic forest.
