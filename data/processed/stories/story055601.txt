Taping of "The Real Housewives of Atlanta" reunion special, scheduled for last week, has been postponed as the cast deals with the death of Kandi Burruss' former fiancé, Ashley "A.J." Jewell, an NBC Universal spokeswoman told CNN Monday.
The Atlanta "Housewives" have been touched by tragedy this season with a loved one's death.
The show is now winding down its second season on the network, and the two-part episode was expected to air on October 29 and November 5.
Cast member and purported "sixth housewife" Dwight Eubanks told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he was "shocked" when he heard of Jewell's passing but does expect the taping to resume eventually.
"I don't see them editing [Jewell] out," he told the newspaper. "It's television. It's reality. We just have to prepare and gear up for next year."
So far, Bravo hasn't erased Jewell's presence from the series. Although scenes with Jewell weren't a part of last Thursday's episode, "Housewives" viewers did watch as Kandi debated the future of her engagement to Jewell with castmate Kim. Blog: What happened on "Housewives"
But commercials for this Thursday's episode showed clips from therapy sessions with Burruss, her mother and Jewell.
Eubanks told the Journal-Constitution that he doesn't know if Burruss will continue with the "Housewives" or not. "She's had such a dramatic year," Eubanks said. "She had her uncle die, too. She has her own career to focus on. Now her life has changed with her daughter and taking temporary custody of [A.J.'s] twins."
Jewell, who died at 34 after a fight outside of an Atlanta strip club on October 3, was buried on October 9.
