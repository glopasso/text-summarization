James Rebhorn, whose acting resume includes a long list of character roles in major films and TV shows, died Friday, his representative said Sunday.  Rebhorn was 65.
While you may not know his name, Rebhorn's face may be familiar as the arrogant headmaster in Al Pacino's "Scent of a Woman" or the scheming secretary of defense in "Independence Day."
Think back to the series finale of TV's "Seinfeld" in 1998. Rebhorn played the district attorney.
Or perhaps you saw him on the polished crime caper "White Collar," where he played loyal FBI chief Reese Hughes for 16 episodes.
More recently, he was Frank Matheson in eight episodes of "Homeland."

Other notable film roles were in "My Cousin Vinny" in 1992 and "The Game" in 1997.
