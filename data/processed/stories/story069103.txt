Bindi Irwin has a message for girls her age: Cover it up.
The teen daughter of the late "Crocodile Hunter" Steve Irwin said in a recent interview with News Corp Australia that she is "a big advocate for young girls dressing their age."
"I mean, for me, I look around at a lot of young girls that are my age and they're always trying to dress older," said Irwin, who turns 16 on July 24. "Whether it's wearing revealing clothes or hardly wearing any clothes at all, I feel really bad for them."
Irwin, who has picked up the wildlife conservation advocacy legacy of her father and grew up at the Australia Zoo, said she considers herself to be an old soul who "loves a cup of tea and a good book."
And while Irwin said her own personal style is evolving from her trademark khakis to more fashionable fare, she keeps it simple and conservative.
"A lot of times I want to grab these girls and say: 'Look, in 10 years you'll regret this,' " she said. "Just dress like who you are. Don't try so hard. A pair of jeans and a T-shirt is just as gorgeous and even makes you look classier."
