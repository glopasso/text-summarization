Forget the Oscars.
Johnny Depp, Adam Sandler, Lindsay Lohan and "Movie 43" are among the esteemed company that will be battling for one of Hollywood's most widely shunned awards: the Razzies.
The nominations for the 34th annual Golden Raspberry Awards were announced Wednesday morning, and the list included some new names -- including Depp, a first-time Razzie nominee for "The Lone Ranger" -- as well as some old favorites, such as Sandler, Lohan and Sylvester Stallone.
Sandler's "Grown Ups 2" led all films with eight nominations.
Great cast! Great director! Why did that movie flop?
Stallone picked up a worst actor Razzie nomination for three 2013 films -- "Bullet to the Head," "Escape Plan" and "Grudge Match." It's his record-breaking 31st nomination.
Depp, on the other hand, had never been singled out by the Razzies before. That changed this year, thanks to "The Lone Ranger," the big summer bomb in which Depp played Tonto. Depp is up for worst actor.
The worst picture nominees are "After Earth," "Grown Ups 2," "The Lone Ranger," "A Madea Christmas" (star Tyler Perry is also up for worst actress) and "Movie 43."
In addition to Depp, worst actor nominations went out to Sandler, Stallone, Ashton Kutcher ("Jobs") and Jaden Smith ("After Earth").
Worst actress nominations include Perry, Lohan ("The Canyons"), Halle Berry ("The Call" and "Movie 43"), Selena Gomez ("The Getaway") and Naomi Watts ("Diana" and "Movie 43").
Other nominations went to Larry the Cable Guy, who picked up two, for worst supporting actor and worst screen combo, a joint nomination with "Madea Christmas" co-star Tyler Perry; Lady Gaga, up for worst supporting actress for "Machete Kills"; and "the 13 people who directed 'Movie 43.'"
Votes were received from 750 Golden Raspberry Award Foundation members, and worst screen combo was voted on by 62,000 RottenTomatoes.com participants.
