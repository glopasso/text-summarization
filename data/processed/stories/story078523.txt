A line drive struck Tampa Bay Rays pitcher Alex Cobb flush in the head Saturday afternoon, sending him sprawling to the ground and eventually to a Florida hospital.
The incident occurred during the fifth inning of the Rays' home game with the Kansas City Royals at Tropicana Field. Video shows Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer hitting a pitch right back up the middle -- hitting Cobb on the right ear, Tampa Bay explained in a tweet.
The 25-year-old Cobb immediately clutched his head and fell to the ground as the ball careened back to Rays catcher Jose Lobaton, who proceeded to throw Hosmer out at first base.
Cobb was later taken off the field on a stretcher and taken to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg.
"He remained conscious the entire time," the Tampa Bay franchise said on Twitter.
A few hours later -- after the Rays wrapped up a 5-3 win -- the team tweeted about Cobb's condition.
"Alex Cobb was diagnosed with a mild concussion," the club said. "All tests came back normal."
According to the Rays' website, Cobb -- a righthander in his third season in the majors -- has a 2.95 ERA in 12 starts this year. He's notched 73 strikeouts, versus 20 walks, and held opposing batters to a .233 average.
