Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who announced in December he would "actively explore" a presidential bid in 2016, has resigned from all of his corporate and nonprofit board memberships, an aide confirmed to CNN.
The move was first reported by the Washington Post.
"He will be reviewing his remaining business engagements in the coming year," an aide to the former governor said Wednesday evening.
Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell characterized the resignations as a "natural next step" for Bush as he "turns his focus to gauging whether there is support for a potential candidacy."
Bush will only remain on the board of the companies in which he is a partner, including his business consulting company Jeb Bush and Associates, the aide said.
Campbell said Wednesday that Bush "is reviewing his business engagements as he now actively explores a run for the presidency."
Bush previously stepped down from the board of directors at Rayonier Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corporation, and British bank Barclays.
His resignations further indicate that Bush is taking the possibility of a 2016 run seriously.
