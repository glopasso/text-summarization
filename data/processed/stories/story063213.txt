A JetBlue plane was diverted to Orlando on Wednesday after an emergency evacuation slide opened in flight, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
No injuries were reported.
The slide opened on JetBlue Flight 1266, which was scheduled to fly from Fort Myers, Florida, to Boston, the FAA said.
The Embraer E-190 aircraft made a safe landing at the Orlando International Airport around 3:40 p.m. ET.
It was not immediately clear what caused the slide to deploy into the aircraft cabin.
There were 73 passengers and four crew members on board at the time of the incident, according to JetBlue. The aircraft was taken out of service for inspection.
The National Transportation and Safety Board said it was aware of what happened and looking into it. It will decide whether to investigate based on what it learns.
