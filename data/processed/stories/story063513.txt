Remember when the new "Star Wars" trailer was burning up the Internet?
George Lucas apparently didn't get the memo.
The franchise's creator recently told the New York Post's Page Six that he hasn't watched the teaser for next year's "Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," which makes him the only one on the planet.
When asked about it, Lucas reportedly replied "I don't know anything about it. I haven't seen it yet."
Somewhere, director J.J. Abrams might be feeling a bit of a sting.
Lucas reportedly sold Lucasfilm, the production company behind the "Star Wars" franchise, to Disney for billions in 2012.
He told Page Six he does plan on seeing the new film when it arrives in theaters on December 18, 2015, but when asked whether he was curious about the goings-on new version, he replied, "Not really."
Might he be a bit irked at the Internet's parodic "George Lucas Special Edition" of the trailer?
