The mother of a missing Shreveport, Louisiana, girl said Tuesday that one of two men suspected in her daughter's disappearance spent time at their home, playing video games and hanging out with their family.
Henry Lee was "always very polite, very nice. We thought he was a very decent person," Karen White, the mother of missing 12-year-old Amber White, told HLN's "Prime News." "We would have never ever expected that he would have done something like this."
Lee, 24, was arrested Monday on aggravated kidnapping charges, according to Shreveport police. A second man, Brandon Player, 19, was also arrested Monday in the case and charged with contributing to the delinquency of a juvenile.
White said Tuesday that Lee was an "associate" of one of her family's good friends.
Police are searching for any clues into the whereabouts of Amber, who was last seen Sunday after she went to the neighborhood pool.
However, it started raining shortly after she left her house, her mother said.
"My husband realized it was raining and he went down to get her and she was gone," Karen White said.
Two witnesses told police they had seen her get into an Oldsmobile Cutlass, according to Shreveport police Sgt. Bill Goodin.
The witnesses were able to provide authorities with a license plate number, and police tracked the car to Player.
"Through interviews and other information gathering, that ultimately led us to Henry Lee," Goodin told "Prime News."
Goodin said police don't believe an "abduction" occurred, but added that investigators aren't ruling anything out as they search for Amber.
Karen White described her daughter as a good kid who never fails to check in with her parents.
"I think she was coerced to get into a car," White said. "I don't think she did it on her own. The daughter that I know would not do something like this."
Player has been released from police custody on bond. Lee remained in jail Tuesday night.
