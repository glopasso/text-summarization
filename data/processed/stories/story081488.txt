West Coast rap pioneer Too Short appeared to be too slow Wednesday morning when, police say, he tried to run from an officer in Hollywood.
Todd Anthony Shaw -- that's the 46-year-old rapper's real name -- was charged with a felony count of drug possession after police found suspected meth on him, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman. He also faces a charge of driving under the influence of alcohol.
Los Angeles Police stopped Shaw on Hollywood Boulevard at 3 a.m. -- an hour when the numerous clubs in the neighborhood are closing -- as part of a random drunken driving check.
He tried to run away after blowing into the intoxication meter, Officer Cleon Joseph told CNN. "He didn't get very far at all."
Police booked Shaw in a Los Angeles County jail, where he was being held Wednesday morning in lieu of $10,000 bond, according to the sheriff's website.
CNN efforts to get comment from a representative for Shaw were not immediately successful
The Oakland, California-based rapper has collaborated with Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G. and other major artists in the past three decades. Major songs on his resume include "The Ghetto" and "Blow the Whistle."
