In a perfect world, C-level executives and employees on all rungs of the corporate ladder would communicate openly, honestly, conveniently and often. Companies, big and small, and their executives would boast of abilities to listen to feedback, answer questions and maintain close relationships with all employees.
Like I said -- in a perfect world.
While these relationships might exist in a few companies, it's virtually impossible with larger corporations. Lucky for them, that's why we have human resource (HR) professionals.
"Human resource employees used to strictly work behind-the-scenes of a company, handling the administration of areas such as payroll, hiring and benefits," says Rosemary Haefner, vice president of Human Resources with CareerBuilder.com. "Now, HR goes beyond the tactical aspects of these areas and acts as a strategic player. HR is the liaison between employees and top executives, helping executives understand what their workers really need and how to maximize their potential."
Overall HR employment is projected to grow by 17 percent between 2006 and 2016, estimating 1,015,000 jobs in 2016, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Plus, as the need for good HR specialists and executives increases, so does their annual compensation, according to a survey by Watson Wyatt, a global consulting firm, in association with the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM). In 2007, the highest percentage increases in average salary were given to HR professionals with strong skills in knowledge of compensation, benefits, international HR and diversity.
Other skills and qualifications for HR professionals include interpersonal capabilities, as well as a college degree. Most entry-level jobs require a degree in human resources or a background in business or liberal arts. An advanced degree is required for some jobs, as well as specific certifications.
