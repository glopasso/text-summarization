A miner in northeast China was rescued Saturday after being buried underground for 17 days, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported.
The miner, whose name wasn't released, was in stable condition after receiving treatment in a hospital, the agency said. He was retrieved from a coal mine at about 4 a.m. Saturday, the news agency said.
On May 2, a coal mine in the Heilongjiang Province flooded as 28 miners were working underground, the agency said. The flooded shaft was part of the Junyuan No. 2 Coal Mine, located in Xing'an district of Hegang city, Xinhua said.
Ten miners died, 10 more escaped, five were rescued, and three are still missing, the news agency said.
Rescuers continue to drain the flooded mine, authorities said.
Last week, torrential rains flooded northwest China and left 57 persons dead and 15 people missing as of Friday, Xinhua reported.
