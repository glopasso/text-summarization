Brazilian football legend Pele's condition has improved, according to a Thursday evening statement from a Sao Paulo hospital.
There had been earlier concerns about Pele's health after Albert Einstein Hospital issued a release that said his condition was "unstable."
Thursday night's release said Pele was relocated to the intensive care unit because a kidney dialysis machine he needed was in ICU.
"He is now temporarily on renal support without any additional support," the statement said.
The 74-year-old's representative and Pele's Twitter account dispute that the great is in ICU, saying he had been moved to a "special care" room with greater privacy.
"I want to take this opportunity to let you know that I am doing fine," his Twitter feed stated.
Pele was admitted to the medical facility earlier this week with a urinary tract infection. He recently underwent surgery to remove kidney stones at the same institution.
Pele is considered one of the greats of world soccer, winning three World Cups for Brazil in 1958, 1962 and 1970.
The Brazilian is also one of the most globally recognized faces in sports.
