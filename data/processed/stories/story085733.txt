Bradley Wiggins' bid to add the Giro d'Italia title to his Tour de France crown suffered another blow Saturday as the British cycling star lost more time in the eighth stage time trial.
Wiggins, who crashed in wet conditions on Friday, dropped to more than a minute behind the new leader Vincenzo Nibali after a puncture forced him to change bikes.
The 33-year-old battled back to take second place in the 54.8-kilometer stage between Gabicce Mare and Saltara, 10 seconds behind the winner -- his compatriot Alex Dowsett.
Nibali was 21 seconds adrift in fourth but it was enough to give the Italian rider a 29-second advantage over Australia's 2011 Tour de France winner Cadel Evans, who was seventh.
Previous leader Benat Intxausti lost more than three and a half minutes as he dropped to 14th overall.
Wiggins, who will not lead Team Sky at this year's Tour, was frustrated after his latest setback.
"I think there was some initial disappointment because I wanted to win the stage," he told his team's website. "It's been a challenging few days with the crash yesterday and then to come back up. It wasn't an easy course.
"Then obviously to have a puncture and have to change bikes and disrupt the rhythm is never going to help. But then the second part of the course was really suited to me and I took back a lot of time on people there.
"It's put us right back up there now. It's going to be a hell of a race for the next two weeks."
His former teammate Dowsett, the British time trial champion, is now racing for Spain's Movistar alongside Intxausti in the three-week event -- one of the three elite races on the cycling calendar along with Le Tour and the Spanish Vuelta.
"I'll need some time to digest this victory, I still can't believe it," said the 24-year-old, who pledged to help Intxausti move back up the standings.
