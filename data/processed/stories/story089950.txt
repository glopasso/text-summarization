Walking in on an already occupied bathroom can be awkward and uncomfortable, but when that occupant is a 12-foot python, it can be terrifying.
But that's just what happened to Veronica Rodriguez of College Station, Texas, last week when she discovered an African rock python in her bathtub.
Police and animal control officers were called and able to capture the intruder, which Rodriguez surmises came through her open back door.
Aggieland Humane Society Executive Director Kathy Bice told CNN affiliate KTRK that the snake was legally owned and that its owner had reported it missing two months ago.
