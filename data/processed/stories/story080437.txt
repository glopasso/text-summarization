Former "Scandal" actor Columbus Short has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge of battery, according to a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Superior Court.
The actor was arrested in March after being accused of punching and knocking out a patron at a West Los Angeles restaurant. Short appeared in court on Wednesday and must appear again on June 5 so a preliminary hearing date can be set.
The actor has had other allegations of violence lodged against him. In April, Short's wife accused him of threatening to kill her and himself with a knife.
Tanee Short filed for both a restraining order, to keep him from her and their two-year-old daughter, and for a divorce to end their nine-year marriage. Shortly thereafter, Columbus Short announced he would not be returning to the hit ABC series "Scandal."
