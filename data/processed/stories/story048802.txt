(CNN)Sports personality Jim Rome apologized for calling members of marching bands "dorks" after Band Nation schooled the professional provocateur on what it takes to be in a band.
The CBS sportscaster, who has earned a reputation for name-calling and starting fights, started the controversy on Thursday with a tweet that has since been deleted.
"Is there anyone not in a marching band who thinks those dorks running around with their instruments are cool?"
Musicians and marching bands responded using the hashtag #MarchOnRome with a few examples of why being in a marching band is more than running around a field, prompting Rome to apologize.
For example, when was the last time you or Rome had an audience with the Pope in Italy?
Also, marching band is not just a college thing. The U.S. Army has its own marching band consisting of active service members.
The controversy has even prompted an online petition asking CBS Sports to air the Drum Corps International's World Championship Finals this fall. Here's to hoping!
