A family of four is dead after a man driving the wrong way on an interstate highway in Idaho slammed into them head-on, authorities said.
Amado Herrera, 48, of California, was driving west on Interstate 84 near Glenns Ferry, Idaho, with three passengers when a pickup truck slammed into them Thursday night, Idaho State Police said.
Eusebio Jacobo Pineda, 45, was driving his Ford F-150 the wrong way on the highway shortly before 8:50 p.m. when he hit Herrera's Nissan four-door, police said.
Herrera and his passengers died instantly. Pineda was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.
Others in Herrera's car were identified as Luz Herrera, age unknown, Ivette Herrera, 18, and Antoni Herrera, 9. All are from South El Monte, California.
All of the Herreras were wearing seatbelts, police said in a written release.
It's not known whether Pineda wore a safety belt, they said. Pineda's truck rolled after impact, police said, and local media images showed the entire front end of Herrera's car crushed.
Traffic on Interstate 84 was blocked for about four hours Thursday night. Police told CNN Friday that the crash is still under investigation. No criminal charges had been filed.
