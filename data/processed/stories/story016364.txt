Buildings were burning at a prison in southern England on Saturday, more than 12 hours after prisoners started a riot by smashing windows and setting fires.
Fires were burning in at least two buildings at HMP Ford, an open prison with numerous one-story residence halls on a grassy campus.
At least one of the buildings was destroyed, according to aerial footage of the scene.
Two fire engines escorted by specialist prison officers in riot gear went onto prison grounds Saturday afternoon as fires engulfed large parts of two more buildings, sending thick black smoke into the air.
The Ministry of Justice said there were no reports of injuries to either prisoners or staff.
The incident began around midnight (7 p.m. ET Friday) and forced prison staff to retreat. Police, firefighters and specialist teams of prison officers had to be called in.
An additional 140 prison service staff arrived at Ford around midday Saturday to help bring the prison under full control, the Ministry of Justice said, emphasizing it was not an indication the situation was escalating.
Ford is in a former Royal Navy station in Arundel, near the coast about two hours south of London. It was converted to a prison in 1960 and houses offenders who have fewer than two years left to serve on their sentences.
Prisoners there are convicted of a variety of offenses, though the prison does not accept those convicted of arson, some sexual offenses and harassment.
