It was silver in Sochi -- but Austria's Marcel Hirscher was back on top after winning the World Cup slalom crystal globe.
Hirscher defeated Germany's Felix Neureuther after recording a time of 2 minutes 07.74 seconds to win the overall World Cup title for the third year in succession.
Hirscher showed little sign of nerves in Lenzerheide, Switzerland, as he kept his cool throughout to overturn a five point deficit.
"I knew it would be all or nothing," Hirscher told reporters. "Only the result counted.
"I laid down a marker on the first leg and on the second we saw that the course-setting made little difference.
"It didn't really suit me, but I was still quick."
Hirscher added: "With this slalom crystal globe, I've fulfilled another wish and goal, my season's perfect."
Olympic slalom champion Mario Matt finished third and claimed 60 points to take him up to sixth in the overall standings.
In the women's event, Austria's Anna Fenninger won the giant slalom race after finishing 0.25 seconds ahead of teammate Eva-Maria Brem.
The victory earned Fenninger both the small and big globe as the season's top overall skier after seeing off Sweden's Jessica Lindell-Vikarby.
"It was an unbelievable day for me," Fenninger told the competition's official website.
"There are a lot of emotions for me today. It was a great battle for the giant slalom globe with Jessica and I am and just really happy with today and the entire week in Lenzerheide."
Fenninger ended the season in the top-three of every discipline with the exception of slalom.
