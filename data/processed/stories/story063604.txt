Morrissey's summer plans have hit a snag.
The British singer was planning to tour the United States in support of his album, "World Peace is None of Your Business," which will be released July 15, but has had to scrap those plans due to ill health.
"It is with great sadness that the remainder of the US Tour has been canceled," said a June 10 message on his Facebook page. "The respiratory infection Morrissey contracted in Miami has worsened, and in the interest of making a full recovery, all further touring plans have been halted."
It appears Morrissey fell ill after performing in Miami in late May, and matters didn't improve following a performance in Boston the weekend of June 7.
As a result, the former Smiths singer is relinquishing his plans to explore the United States in favor of getting better.
"Morrissey thanks his fans for their compassion, understanding, and well-wishes during this difficult period as he recuperates," the Facebook message said.
