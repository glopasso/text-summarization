At least 11 people were killed and six others were injured in Cameroon when Boko Haram militants opened fire on a bus late Thursday, local time, residents said.
The attack took place in Waza, a region bordering northeast Nigeria.
The Islamist group, which dominates swaths of Nigeria's largely ungoverned north, has increasingly conducted attacks outside of Nigeria, targeting Cameroonian military forces and civilians.
At least 23 people were killed in an assault by the militant group in the Mozogo district in Cameroon's Far North Region, said Mijiyawa Bakary, a regional governor.
In May of last year, the group kidnapped 10 Chinese construction workers in Waza and killed another worker. The hostages were freed in October.
