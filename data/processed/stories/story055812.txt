A portion of the interview will air on CNN on Monday, August 19 at 8:00 a.m. ET.
The special chronicles the prince's passion for Africa and his dream to save the world's most endangered species.
As a new father, the prince discusses his hope that one day his son can experience the same Africa that he and Prince Harry did as young boys.
Britain's royal family has worked on conservation in Africa for generations. In the one-hour TV special William tells CNN how his love of Africa and its endangered species were instilled in him by his father, Prince Charles, and late mother Princess Diana.
The prince also highlights some of the work being done by individuals in the area of conservation including Tusk, an organization for which he and Prince Harry are both patrons.
