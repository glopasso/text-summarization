The mother of "Modern Family" star Ariel Winter is denying allegations that she abused the 14-year-old actress.
"It's all untrue, it's all untrue," Chris Workman told People about allegations in a court document relating to guardianship of Winter.
Winter, whose real name is Ariel W. Workman, stars as Alex Dunphy in the ABC comedy series.
Last month, a Los Angeles judge ordered the young actress be placed in temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray.
"It's most unfortunate that the matter has become an interest of the press," said Michael Kretzmer, Gray's attorney. "Ariel's best interest is what we're concerned about, and that's what we'll work for in future court proceedings."
Kretzmer declined to offer further details about the case.
The lawyer filed a petition on behalf of Gray on October 3, alleging Winter was the victim of ongoing physical abuse, insults about her weight, deprivation of food and attempts to "sexualize" a minor. Guardianship with Gray was necessary to protect Winter from further abuse, Kretzmer said in the document.
A judge ruled that Chris Workman have no contact with Winter until a November 20 hearing on the matter.
CNN was unable to reach Chris Workman for comment Thursday.
But the mother told People, "I have my doctor's letter that my daughter's never been abused. ... I have stylists' letters that she's never been abused."
ABC and personal representatives for Winter declined to comment.
Kretzmer also contended in the court document that guardianship was necessary because Chris Workman receives checks for Winter's work on "Modern Family" and has control of a related financial account.
