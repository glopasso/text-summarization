PARIS, France -- Samoa center Brian Lima's World Cup is over after his dangerous tackle on England star Jonny Wilkinson.
Lima arrives for his hearing regarding his dangerous challenge on England's Jonny Wilkinson.
Lima, the only player to feature in five World Cups, has received a three-week suspension after being cited for the tackle during Saturday's Pool A clash in Nantes.
Wilkinson escaped injury and match referee Alan Lewis did not punish Lima during the game, which England won 44-22 to knock Samoa out of the competition.
But World Cup judicial officer Professor Lorne Crerar has upheld the complaint lodged by match citing commissioner Steven Hines.
It means 35-year-old Lima will miss Samoa's tournament finale against the United States on Wednesday, with an additional two weeks' punishment also imposed.
Lima is poised to quit international rugby after the World Cup, and although he has 48 hours to appeal against the decision, it is improbable a hearing could be convened before Wednesday's game.
Samoa will head home after the U.S clash, having already seen the current World Cup campaign consigned to being the worst in their history.  E-mail to a friend
