WCBS news anchor Rob Morrison is facing charges of allegedly choking his wife, CBS MoneyWatch anchor Ashley Morrison, according to Connecticut authorities.
Rob Morrison was taken into custody early Sunday at the couple's Darien home when police responded to a "domestic violence incident" called in by Ashley Morrison's mother, according to a statement from the Darien Police Department.
He was arrested and accused of choking his wife with both hands after becoming "increasingly belligerent...during the course of the evening," the statement said.
Officers observed red marks on Ashley Morrison's neck, but she did not request medical treatment, according to the police department release.
While being processed, Rob Morrison made verbal threats to further harm his wife, according to the police statement.
In a joint statement released Monday, the couple's attorney, Robert Skovgaard, said, "Rob and Ashley Morrison are cooperating fully with the authorities to insure that all of the information necessary to properly evaluate this unfortunate incident is made available."
"The Morrisons are confident that a full review of this matter will show that the allegations have been greatly exaggerated."
WCBS spokeswoman Rachel Ferguson said because this is a personal matter, the station is declining to comment.
Morrison is scheduled to be in court Tuesday on charges of second-degree strangulation, second-degree threatening and disorderly conduct.
