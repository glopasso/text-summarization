(CNN)Bono has shared with fans that recovery from an accident has been slow going and that he's worried he may never play guitar again.
The U2 frontman underwent hours of multiple surgeries in November after a bicycle accident in New York City  when he tried to avoid another rider in Central Park. The singer broke his arm in six spots, and he fractured his eye socket and shoulder blade.
U2's Bono suffered extensive injuries, had hours of surgery
On New Year's Day, he posted a blog entry on the band's website in which he detailed his struggle.
"Recovery has been more difficult than I thought," Bono wrote. "As I write this, it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again. The band have reminded me that neither they nor Western civilization are depending on this."
In the blog entry, titled "Little Book of a Big Year: Bono's A to Z of 2014" the star reveals that he "blanked out on impact and have no memory of how I ended up in New York Presbyterian with my humerus bone sticking through my leather jacket. Very punk rock as injuries go."
The possibility that he may never play again caused Bono to reflect that "I personally would very much miss fingering the frets of my green Irish falcon or my (RED) Gretsch."
"Just for the pleasure, aside from writing tunes," he added. "But then does the Edge, or Jimmy Page, or any guitarist you know have a titanium elbow, as I do now? I'm all elbows, I am."
Bono says he will be focusing on his continued recovery.
"The consequences of this freak accident are significant enough that I will have to concentrate hard to be ready for the U2 tour in fitness terms," he wrote. "As a result I have cancelled every public appearance and decided this missive is all the communication I can manage for the first half of 2015, beyond muttering and singing to myself of course."
