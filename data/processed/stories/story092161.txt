First lady Michelle Obama's official trip to southern Africa next week will focus on youth leadership and education, and will include meetings with key figures in the anti-apartheid struggle.
Obama will make stops in South Africa and Botswana during the weeklong visit that starts Monday.
She will highlight the benefits of education and wellness, and urge youth in the continent to be part of the national dialogue, according to the White House.
"The trip is a continuation of Mrs. Obama's work to engage young people, especially girls and young women, at home and abroad," the White House said.
The first lady's first stop will be in Pretoria, where she will meet with South African President Jacob Zuma.
Before heading to Johannesburg and Cape Town, she will take a tour of an apartheid museum with Nelson Mandela's wife, Graca Machel.
She will also visit Robben Island, where Mandela was held for the majority of the 27 years he was in detention for fighting apartheid.
The schedule released by the White House did not mention a meeting with the 92-year-old former president.
The latter part of the trip includes a meeting with Nobel laureate Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and a visit to Soweto and the site of the 2010 World Cup.
Her visit to neighboring Botswana will include a tribute to girls overcoming hurdles to success.
In addition to visits with top leaders, she will also attend a series of public events, meet embassy officials and take part in community service projects in both countries.
After a safari, she will depart from the Botswana capital of Gaborone on Sunday.
Her visit marks the second to sub-Saharan Africa by a member of the Obama family since the president took office more than two years ago.
President Barack Obama went to Ghana in 2009.The first lady made similar trips to Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, India, Mexico and the United Kingdom. She will be accompanied by her mother, Marian Robinson, and two daughters, Sasha and Malia.
