(EW.com) -- ABC's "The Bachelor" closed its season with a finale that posted ratings gains over last year.
The two-hour episode was up 14 percent among adults 18-49 compared to last season's finale, and marked the show's highest-rated episode of the season. The gain isn't surprising considering "The Bachelor's" whole 17th season run was stronger than last year's edition.
The network also points out that this season resulted in quadruple the number of tweets.
Desiree Hartsock is next 'Bachelorette'
The "After the Final Rose" special once again showcased "The Bachelor's" unique pattern of generating a bigger rating for its post-finale special than for the actual finale. The special was up 15 percent from last year.
ABC also announced that former "Bachelor" Sean Lowe has been added to the upcoming edition of "Dancing With the Stars," and that "Bach" fan favorite Desiree Hartsock will be this summer's "Bachelorette." Full finale recap here.
Elsewhere: Fox's "The Following" dipped after weeks of steadiness, probably due to having a "Bones" repeat. CBS' "Rules of Engagement" hit a season low. NBCs "The Biggest Loser" hit a low.
