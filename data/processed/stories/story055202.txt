Veronica Campbell-Brown has been cleared to return to competition by officials in her native Jamaica despite the three-time Olympic sprint gold medalist having tested positive for a banned substance earlier this year.
However, one of Jamaica's most decorated athletes must now wait to see if the IAAF, track and field's world governing body, agrees with the recommendation made by the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA).
If it does, it would provide welcome relief for Jamaica's sprinting community -- Asafa Powell and Sherone Simpson admitted to testing positive for banned substances in July.
Garth Gayle, general secretary of the JAAA, confirmed to CNN Thursday that it recommended Campbell-Brown receive a warning following her positive test for a banned diuretic in May. She was provisionally suspended.
Gayle didn't reveal further details but the Jamaican Gleaner newspaper reported that the JAAA's disciplinary panel ruled the 31-year-old didn't use the substance to enhance performance.
The IAAF's doping review board is expected to make a decision in the case in two or three weeks, an IAAF spokesman told CNN.
Campbell-Brown, Powell -- the former world-record holder in the 100 meters -- and Simpson all missed August's world championships in Moscow, where fellow Jamaican Usain Bolt once again dominated the men's sprint events.
Bolt, consistently under the spotlight, has never tested positive.
"I don't believe the majority of athletes enter the sport to cheat," said Gayle.
While not necessarily performance enhancing, diuretics can be used as a masking agent for steroids.
