Let's be honest: Was there any way Alfonso "The Carlton" Ribeiro wasn't going to win "Dancing With the Stars" this season?
During Tuesday night's finale, the "Fresh Prince of Bel Air" star was crowned the king of the dance floor as he and his pro partner, Witney Carson, were awarded the mirrorball trophy.
The actor -- and now dancer -- was so thrilled, he was moved to tears.
"I cannot believe this," Riberio told co-host Tom Bergeron. "I've wanted it forever. ... I don't even know what to say. These are happy tears."
Ribeiro has been a strong competitor and an audience favorite throughout season 19, even treating us to "The Carlton" more than once.
Yet he almost didn't get the opportunity to see it all the way through. The star injured himself during the course of the season to the point that he wasn't sure whether he'd be able to continue.
But by the start of the two-part finale on Monday, Ribeiro rallied and turned in a tap dance solo that left viewers speechless.
Despite his injuries, Ribeiro performed impeccably during Monday's episode and had the lead score going into Tuesday's finale.
Fellow competitors Janel Parrish and Sadie Robertson were right at his heels, with "Pretty Little Liars" actress Parrish going into Tuesday's finale with a score of 77 and "Duck Dynasty" star Robertson in second place with a score of 78.
The three final competitors were challenged to create a fusion dance routine with less than 24 hours to prepare. Although they all earned perfect scores for their performances on Tuesday, neither Parrish nor Robertson could overtake Ribeiro.
"Thank you so much America for giving @witneycarson and I the Mirrorball," the actor later posted on Instagram, along with a photo of himself with Carson; his wife, Angela Unkrich; and their young son. "A dream come true. Love you all."
