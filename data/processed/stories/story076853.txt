The new James Bond movie will be called "Skyfall," the producers announced in London Thursday.
Oscar-winner Sam Mendes will direct Daniel Craig as 007 in the 23rd Bond movie.
"We'll start shooting today," Mendes said.
Spanish actor Javier Bardem will play the villain, and Judi Dench will reprise her role as Bond's boss, M.
The cast also includes French actress Berenice Marlohe.
The announcement of the title of the movie came on the 50th anniversary of the date Sean Connery was revealed as the first actor to play Ian Fleming's spy.
