The Rolling Stones performed an impromptu, warm-up gig at a small Paris club on Thursday night.
The band tweeted about the secret show just hours before they took the stage at La Trabendo, writing that 350 tickets were up for grabs at â‚¬15 a pop.
According to a press release, 600 fans were in attendance to see Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Ronnie Wood.
The Stones kicked off the intimate show with "Route 66," before launching into "It's Only Rock and Roll."
"I can't believe we're all still standing up, you'd think by now one or two of us would be sitting down, but we're not," Jagger told the crowd.
Mixed in with the classics was the recently released "Doom and Gloom," the band's first new song together in seven years. They recorded the track in Paris and shot a video with Swedish actress Noomi Rapace, Jagger tweeted Wednesday.
Closing their set with "Midnight Rambler," they returned for an encore playing both "Jumping Jack Flash" and "Brown Sugar."
The Rolling Stones are celebrating their 50th anniversary this year with four arena shows; they'll perform at London's O2 arena on November 25 and 29 before taking the stage at the Newark Prudential Center on December 13 and 15.
