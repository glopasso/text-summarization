Afghan police repelled an attack on an army recruitment center in Kandahar on Thursday, officials said.
One suicide attacker died when he detonated explosives, while three others were shot and killed by police, the Kandahar province's media department said.
In addition to the attackers, one person was killed and nine others were wounded, the director of Mirwais Hospital in Kandahar said. One civilian was among the wounded, said Abdul Qayum Pokhla.
Zalmai Ayoubi, a spokesman for the provincial government, said the suicide attackers entered a building that was under construction and fired at the recruitment center across the street.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.
Meanwhile, Afghan forces and coalition troops killed more than 80 insurgents during an anti-terrorism operation in the mountainous Kunar province along the border with Pakistan, NATO said.
They also seized numerous weapons, materials for making improved explosive devices, and captured a radio station used to solicit money and direct attacks on civilians, NATO said.
