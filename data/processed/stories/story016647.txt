A Singapore Airlines flight to Hong Kong had to turn back in mid-flight Friday after the pilots received an alert about a problem with a cargo door on the plane, the company said.
The aircraft, an Airbus A380 superjumbo, returned to Singapore's Changi airport on Friday afternoon "as a result of a cockpit warning relating to a cargo door," the airline said in an e-mailed statement.
Flight SQ 866 landed safely back at Changi at 2:20 p.m. local time, Singapore Airlines said, adding that passengers would be transferred to a replacement flight to Hong Kong.
The airline didn't provide further details about the incident, nor did it immediately respond to a question from CNN about whether the cargo door issue affected cabin pressure.
The replacement aircraft was expected to arrive in Hong Kong at 8:40 p.m., more than three and a half hours after the original scheduled arrival time, according to the Singapore Airlines website.
The double-decker A380 is capable of carrying more passengers than any other commercial aircraft.
