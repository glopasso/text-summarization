Bayern Munich resumed their quest for a 23rd league title on Saturday with a 2-0 win over Greuther Furth at the Allianz Arena as the Bundesliga returned to action after it's annual winter break.
Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic scored twice -- one in each half -- to earn Bayern all three points to keep Jupp Heynckes' side nine points clear at the top and Greuther Furth anchored at the foot of the table.
Heynckes, who gives way to Pep Guardiola at the end of the season, was satisfied with his team's performance.
"We're pleased we won and also kept a clean sheet," Heynckes said.
"Our game was tenacious and not so fluid as we are used to, but perhaps that is a positive, as we know what we have to work on," he added.
Bayer Leverkusen remain in second place after a 3-1 win at home to fourth-placed Frankfurt.
Two goals in two minutes from Polish defender Sebastian Boenisch and striker Stefan Kiessling saw the home side take control of the match on the half-hour mark.
Andre Schuerrle made it 3-0 in the 58th minute, before Frankfurt's Alexander Meier scored a consolation goal with 12 minutes remaining.
Defending champions Borussia Dortmund thumped Werder Bremen 5-0 to stay in third place while seventh-placed Mainz and sixth-placed Freiburg played out a goalless draw.
The game between Hoffenheim and Moenchengladbach also ended goalless -- a result which keeps Hoffenheim third from bottom and still seven points from safety. Moenchengladbach remain eighth.
Sunday's fixtures see Nuremberg take on Hamburg, while Duesseldorf host Augbsurg.
