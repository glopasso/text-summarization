Whelp, this is the natural conclusion of the social media overshare/celebrity-obsessed age: The reality show "I Slept With a Celebrity," executive produced by Bravo's Andy Cohen, is currently being shopped around to various networks, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

Cohen producing seems like an interesting choice; his "Watch What Happens Live!" on Bravo is very goofy and celeb-friendly. It'll be interesting to see if guests are as willing to continue being chummy with him if embarrassing stories come to light on "I Slept With a Celebrity."
The project is in the early stages right now, so it remains to be seen if viewers' gag reflex will keep eyeballs away, or if millions will secretly watch it in their homes with a car-crash-like inability to look away. (See also: Clicking on Kardashian wedding photos.)
