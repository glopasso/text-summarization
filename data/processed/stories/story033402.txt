Critics around the country have spoken: The Coen brothers' "Inside Llewyn Davis" is their top film from 2013.
On Saturday, the '60s-era story of a struggling folk singer beat out other awards season favorites "American Hustle," "12 Years A Slave" and "Her" for the best picture honor from the National Society of Film Critics.

The organization is made up of the nation's distinguished movie buffs, many of whom voted in the Society's 48th annual awards meeting on January 4. Instead of dragging out the awards process, the Society of Film Critics simply meets and votes using a weighted ballot. As long as a movie opened in the United States during 2013, it was up for consideration.
In the end, "Inside Llewyn Davis" pulled ahead for the best picture win, while "American Hustle" was second. "12 Years A Slave" and "Her" ended up tying for third place.
The love for "Llewyn" didn't end there: Joel and Ethan Coen shared the best director win, and star Oscar Isaac -- who plays the ornery, ambitious artist Llewyn -- was named best actor. The film, which also stars Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund and Justin Timberlake, also won the best cinematography award.
In the best supporting actor category, the Society of Film Critics favored James Franco's turn as Alien in "Spring Breakers" over Jared Leto's praised performance in "Dallas Buyers Club."
