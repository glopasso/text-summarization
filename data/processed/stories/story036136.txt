Tropical Storm Raymond strengthened into a hurricane Sunday off Mexico's Pacific Coast, threatening to dump heavy rains.
A hurricane watch and tropical storm warning were in effect from Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana, according to the National Hurricane Center. A hurricane warning was issued for Tecpan de Galeana to Lazaro Cardenas.
As of Sunday night, Raymond was 155 miles west-southwest of Acapulco. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph, with higher gusts, and was moving north at 6 mph.
Raymond strengthened rapidly and was expected to continue to strengthen.
The storm is forecast to near the coast within the hurricane warning area late Monday or Tuesday. It is predicted it will take a sharp turn west before it has a chance to reach land, the hurricane center said.
Raymond is forecast to dump heavy rain along the south-central coast of Mexico, with between 2 to 4 inches and up to 8 over the state of Guerrero. The area was hit hard by another storm in September.
The previous storm, Manuel, triggered deadly mudslides and left about 40,000 tourists stranded in Acapulco, a popular tourist destination.
