The board of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference is meeting to discuss whether to keep its current president.
"There has been speculation" that President Isaac Newton Farris Jr. will be dismissed, "but that has not been decided," Maynard Eaton, the SCLC's communications director, said Tuesday night.
"His status is uncertain," Eaton said.
Eaton said the deliberations regarding Farris were "not about character but about the direction the organization is going to go in the future."
Farris was elected president after the death of his predecessor, the Rev. Howard W. Creecy Jr., in July 2011.
The Atlanta-based civil rights group is closely linked to the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., who co-founded the organization along with Ralph David Abernathy and served as its first president.
Farris is King's nephew.
The SCLC has suffered through internal struggles in recent years as two competing factions claimed to run the organization. In 2010, a Fulton County court ruled in favor of the national board.
Creecy became president in January 2011 after King's daughter Bernice King turned down the position, saying she was "not interested in merely being a figurehead" and criticizing the "turmoil, chaos and confusion" that had surrounded the SCLC for more than a year.
After becoming SCLC president, Creecy selected Farris, 50, as his vice president, Eaton said.
