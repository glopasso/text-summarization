The Anchorage, Alaska, airport reopened Sunday afternoon after being closed after an eruption of a nearby volcano on Saturday.
Ash from Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano has been falling, causing flight cancelations.
Ash from Mount Redoubt fell around the city, Alaska's largest, resulting in the closure of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, the Federal Aviation Administration said.
Only a trace amount of the ash reached the airport grounds, airport spokesman Jeremy Lindseth said, but it was enough to affect operations.
The airport reopened at about 2 p.m. ( 6 p.m. ET) Sunday, according to the airport's operations office.
The eruption occurred at about 1:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) Saturday, the U.S. Geological Survey told CNN. The eruption shot ash about 45,000 feet in the air, officials said.
The volcano erupted four times on Friday, at times shooting ash 51,000 feet into the air.
The eruptions are the latest in a series that began March 22.
The Alaska Volcano Observatory has set the alert level at red, its highest possible designation. That indicates an eruption is under way or imminent and the eruption will produce a "significant emission of volcanic ash into the atmosphere." iReport.com: Send photos, videos of the volcanic ash
Friday's volcano activity prompted Alaska Airlines to limit flights to and from Anchorage, according to the airline's Web site.
The airline canceled all its Thursday flights to and from Anchorage after an eruption earlier in the day sent an ash cloud 65,000 feet high.
