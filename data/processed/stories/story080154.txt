Another Hollywood marriage is ending -- but this one was no flash in the pan.
Robin Wright Penn and Sean Penn had been married 11 years.
Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn are divorcing, according to their representative, Mara Buxbaum. People magazine first reported the split Thursday night.
The actors began dating after they met making the 1990 movie "State of Grace." They married in 1996, and have two children, Dylan Frances, 16, and Hopper Jack, 14.
Previously, Penn was married to Madonna for four years, while Wright was married to actor Dane Witherspoon for two years.
