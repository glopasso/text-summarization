Over the next few months CNN will be exploring some of the biggest holidays and events with our iReporters across the world through a special series called CNN Celebrates.
We're kicking things off with Halloween, where elaborate costumes, carved pumpkins and haunted houses all combine to make it one of the world's most exciting -- and terrifying -- celebrations.
Through your iReports we have been able to see how kids, grown-ups, dogs and the supernatural beasts of the world decided to spend this holiday.
If you want to add your own photos or videos of this year's Halloween submit them to the Halloween iReport.
