England's Lee Westwood showed no signs of buckling under the pressure of his new status as golf's world number one, hitting a round of 70 to sit one shot behind leader Francesco Molinari after day two of the HSBC Champions challenge in Shanghai, China.
The Italian led the field on Friday, after a two-round score of nine-under-par gave him a one-shot lead over Westwood, with the man who was displaced at the top of world rankings, Tiger Woods, five shots off the lead.
South African Ernie Els was the day's big mover, his round of 65 put him within two shots of the lead on seven-under-par, alongside compatriot Jaco Van Zyl and Richard Ramsay of Scotland.
The English pair of Luke Donald and Ross Fisher are currently on six-under and five-under respectively, with Westwood's rivals for number one status, Martin Kaymer, and defending champion Phil Mickelson, both six shots off the lead on three-under.
Westwood had no complaints over his form, and was pleased with his performance given his recent lack of competitive action and injury problems.
"It's a good performance the first two rounds to come back to," Westwood told the PGA Tour's official website.
"I didn't know what to expect, and I'm pleasantly surprised with how well I've played."
Woods was in philosophical mood when discussing his round, admitting his score could have gone either way.
"My score could have been worse, but it also could have been a lot better," said Woods.
