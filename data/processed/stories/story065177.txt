(EW.com)  -- There are deep-dish '80s nostalgia movies, like "Adventureland" and "Hot Tub Time Machine."
Then there's "Take Me Home Tonight," which duplicates the car crashes, drug jokes, all-night-long plot twists, and robot hip-hop dance moves of low-rent '80s party flicks with such casual fidelity that you may ask: Why not just watch "Losin' It," "Bachelor Party" or "License to Drive" instead?
I can't claim that "Take Me Home Tonight," set in the summer of 1988, is much better than -- or different from -- the real (cheesy) thing, but it does possess a certain backward-glancing innocent appeal.
Topher Grace, as an MIT grad who has become the world's most overqualified L.A. video-store clerk, looks longer and leaner than before, and he's got a new confidence, too.

He spends the film crashing beer bashes and pretending to be a big deal at Goldman Sachs, all to woo Teresa Palmer, who's like Kristen Stewart minus the storm-cloud moodiness.
The more he lies, the faster he talks, but that's his rite of passage. (Any wuss can be sincere.) He also has to look after his pudgy-loser-sidekick buddy, played by Dan Fogler, who bounces off the walls like Jack Black and also evokes the smarmy-cute Curtis Armstrong from Risky Business.

It gives you a jolt to recall, in this age of geek chic, that being unhip was once truly unhip.
