Someone phoned in a bomb threat to the Moscow Aviation Institute on Tuesday, prompting the evacuation of 7,000 students from all 12 buildings at the institute, officials said.
The threat was specific to one building, but all 12 buildings at the institute were evacuated as a precaution, Moscow police said.
Police have been combing through the buildings with sniffer dogs.
Security in Russia has been a global concern recently as the Sochi Winter Olympics take place about 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) south of Moscow.
