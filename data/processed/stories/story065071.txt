(EW) -- Cory and Topanga are here to stay, at least for another year: The Disney Channel has picked up "Girl Meets World" for a second season.
"Girl Meets World" is a spinoff of the popular '90s sitcom "Boy Meets World," a show that followed the lives of Cory (Ben Savage), Topanga (Danielle Fishel), and their friends and family as they grew up together.

Savage and Fishel reprise their roles as Cory and Topanga in "Girl Meets World" as the parents of middle schooler Riley (Rowan Blanchard).
The spin-off, developed by "Boy Meets World" creators April Kelly and Michael Jacobs, has become the No. 1 TV show among kids ages 2 to 14 since its June 27 premiere on Disney Channel. Kids aren't the only ones watching though: "The series swiftly became a favorite of kids and their parents, many of whom grew up with 'Boy Meets World,'" executive vice president of original programming at Disney Channels Worldwide Adam Bonnett said in a statement.

"Girl Meets World" airs Fridays on Disney Channel.
