Before Nina Pham headed back home to Dallas, Texas, she made one exciting final stop.
The 26 year old nurse, who is now Ebola free, met with President Obama in the Oval Office this afternoon, where the president gave Pham a big hug.
He wasn't the only one to hug Pham Friday.
On Friday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, told reporters that Pham "is cured of Ebola," following multiple tests that confirmed it. Fauci hugged her too.
Pham was first diagnosed earlier this month after treating Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. She was the first person to be diagnosed with the disease on U.S. soil days after Duncan died from Ebola. She came to the Washington region for treatment, attended by caregivers in hazmat suits.

The administration has pushed back against calls for a travel ban, saying it will hurt more than help fight the disease in West Africa.
