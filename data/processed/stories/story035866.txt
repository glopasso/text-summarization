Whether they are designed by cutting-edge architects or decorated with priceless works of art, train and metro stations have become unlikely sites of some of the world's most exquisite architecture and design.
Take New York's Grand Central Terminal, illuminated by a collection of ostentatious chandeliers. Or Madrid's Atocha station, which plays host to a vast indoor garden. Just last week it was announced that London's St Pancras International train station would be installing the second work in its contemporary arts program in April next year.
Suspended high above the international terminus, a group of perspex shard sculptures by the artist David Batchelor will encourage the station's 48 million annual passengers to pause and consider the grandeur of their surroundings.
