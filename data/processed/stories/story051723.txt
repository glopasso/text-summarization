Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has returned to his country after undergoing a second round of chemotherapy in Cuba, state media reported Sunday.
State broadcaster VTV showed images of the leader's return. A group of government ministers were among those who greeted him at the airport.
"Good morning, beloved homeland," Chavez posted on his Twitter account Sunday.
"What a beautiful full moon greeted us at midnight," he added.
Chavez announced in June that doctors in Cuba had removed a cancerous tumor from his body, but he has not specified what type of cancer he has.
He has returned to the island nation for two rounds of chemotherapy.
