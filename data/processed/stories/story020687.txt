Northwest Airlines is investigating why the nose cone on one of its planes was damaged on a flight Sunday from Detroit, Michigan, to Tampa, Florida, a spokeswoman said.
Northwest Airlines Flight 478 landed in Tampa, Florida, on Sunday as scheduled, a spokeswoman said.
The safety of the 182 passengers on board was not compromised, said Northwest spokeswoman Kristin Baur.
The damage to the plane occurred during the flight, it but didn't affect Flight 478's scheduled 2:30 p.m. landing in Tampa, she said.
Baur called the damage a "minor maintenance issue" and a "rare occurrence."
The nose cone appears bashed in, according to pictures that CNN obtained from a passenger awaiting the plane's next leg, to Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota.
The Northwest plane didn't continue onward but was towed away, said the passenger, who was still waiting for a replacement plane five hours later.
