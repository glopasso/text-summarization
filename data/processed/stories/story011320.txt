An Afghan police officer shot and killed nine other officers in southeast Afghanistan on Thursday night, authorities said.
The incident occurred in Paktika province, a spokesman for the provincial governor said. Two police officers were arrested, and another, believed to be part of the attack, fled, the spokesman said.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack and said in a statement that the officer who fired the shots was actually a Taliban fighter.
The shooter was a member of the Afghan Local Police force, International Security Assistance Force spokesman Maj. Joe Buccino said in a statement.
Buccino described the officer as a "rogue" and said the attack was not preceded by any signs of trouble.
ISAF officials are working with provincial and local authorities to investigate the attack, which is the latest by a member of Afghan security forces.
Peter Bergen: Growing threat from Afghan security forces
This year, a third, or 16, of the 46 American service members killed in Afghanistan have died at the hands of Afghan security forces, including Monday when a man alleged to be a local Afghan police officer killed an American service member in eastern Afghanistan.
Gen. John Allen, the commander of the NATO-led force, said officials are working on a new procedure to check the background of Afghans who sign up to join the security services.
The latest killings come after a shooting rampage in Afghanistan this month left 17 villagers dead in the Panjwai district of southern Kandahar province. A U.S. soldier, Staff Sgt. Robert Bales, has been charged with murder.
