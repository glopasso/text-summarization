At least 33 people died and 17 were injured when a train collided Thursday with a bus in Uttar Pradesh state in northern India, authorities said.
The crash happened around 2 a.m. Thursday (4:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) when a bus packed with passengers tried to cross an unguarded railroad, said North-Eastern Railway spokesman Amit Singh.
The bus was hit by the Mathura-Chhapra Express train that was passing through at the same time, Singh said.
India's massive rail network, used by hundreds of thousands of passengers daily, has a poor safety record. Official figures show 100 train accidents occurred in the country in the 2009-10 fiscal year and 115 in 2008-09.
