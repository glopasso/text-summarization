Goalkeeper Hope Solo tells CNN the current United States women's team want to emulate the achievements of the 1999 World Cup-winning squad.
Pia Sundhage's U.S. face Japan in the 2011 World Cup final in Frankfurt on Sunday, 12 years after a team containing stars such as Mia Hamm and Michelle Akers defeated China on penalties to claim the sport's biggest prize.
Solo was 17 when the U.S. clinched their second World Cup triumph on home soil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and, now 29, the magicJack goalkeeper wants the class of 2011 to create their own piece of sporting history.
"Of course they [the 1999 team] inspired me," said Solo, "Michelle Akers being the true inspiration.

"Not only me but many members of this team. She was a true, true winner and we hope she's back there watching. The '99 team truly paved the way for all of us.
"We wouldn't be where we are today as a federation [without them]. They set the standard, they set the bar high ... with that said, 12 years on this team wants to write their own storybook ending."
Solo has been one of the standout performers in the U.S. team's run to the final, her highlight being a save from Daiane during a pulsating penalty shootout victory over Brazil in the quarterfinals.

But despite the plaudits that have come her way, Solo insists the U.S. squad will not be satisfied unless they return home with the World Cup trophy.
"We're not surprised where we stand right now. We came into this tournament with one goal. It wasn't to beat Brazil in the quarterfinal, it wasn't to make it to the final. It was to win the whole thing.
"I think when you get this close, you would have a lot of regrets if you walked away and you didn't win it all."
