"Multiple people" were injured after a small plane crashed into an Orlando area Publix supermarket Monday evening, the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said.
"All customers were evacuated safely and all Publix associates are accounted for," Publix spokesman Dwaine Stevens said.
The store remained closed late Monday.
The first calls about the incident in DeLand, Florida, about 35 miles outside of Orlando, came about 7:20 p.m., Officer Brandon Haught with the Volusia County Sheriff's Office said. Authorities were on the scene within minutes, officials added.
There was some "structural damage to the store's roof," Stevens said, but little else was affected.
Aerial video from local Orlando affiliate WFTV showed nearly a dozen emergency crew vehicles responding to the scene.
Two victims, both with third-degree burns, were being treated at the scene, according to CNN affiliate WESH, which cited Volusia County Sheriff's Office officials.
