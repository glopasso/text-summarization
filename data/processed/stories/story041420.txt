A single ticket holder won more than 160 million pounds ($255 million) in the British Euromillions draw Tuesday night, lottery operator Camelot said Wednesday.
Lottery officials did not say if a winner has come forward.
The winning numbers were 17, 19, 38, 42, 45 with Lucky Stars 09 and 10.
If a single person won the 161,653,000 pound prize, he or she will instantly become about as rich as David and Victoria Beckham, and wealthier than Eric Clapton or Ringo Starr, according to the Sunday Times 2011 Rich List.
CNN's Laura Perez Maestro contibuted to this report.
