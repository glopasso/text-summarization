(EW.com) -- Ready for America's Next Top Katniss?
The CW has ordered two new reality shows, including one that's clearly "Hunger Games"-inspired.
In "The Hunt," 12 tributes teams of two are dropped into the wilderness without food, water or shelter. They must compete in a game where they'll rely on their physicality, survival skills and hunting skills to endure the harsh conditions and kill "capture" one another.

The second new CW reality series is called "Perfect Score." This is a dating show where two friends compete to see who can pick their ideal mate from a group of ...
Yeah, so back to "The Hunt." The competition lasts a full month and the winner will receive a cash prize. No premiere date is set.
It's been awhile since any reality show really made a successful run at a "Survivor"-style competition, so it will be interesting to see how this one turns out.
The order follows The CW developing a drama series, "The Selection," that's been compared to "The Hunger Games" (the project is still alive, I'm told), and toying with the (ill-advised) idea of adapting ultra-violent Japanese cult favorite "Battle Royale," which has a very similar storyline to "The Hunger Games."
EW.com: Critics press The CW on 'Battle Royale' plans: 'You know what it's about, right?'
Perhaps "The Hunt" will be a way for the network to capitalize (Capitolize?) on the hit franchise, like "The Vampire Diaries" post-"Twilight" and "Arrow" post-"Dark Knight."
