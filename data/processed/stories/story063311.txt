(RollingStone.com) -- With its sinister storyline of two women at the funeral of the cheating man they presumably killed, Carrie Underwood's 2012 hit "Two Black Cadillacs" plays out like a movie.... And it didn't take long for Hollywood to catch on.
As confirmed by Deadline, Underwood is teaming up with entertainment moguls Jerry Bruckheimer, Jonathan Littman and Ildy Modrovich to executive produce a six-hour television series based on the song.
KristieAnne Reed will co-executive produce the series, which will air on Fox. Modrovich ("CSI: Miami," "Necessary Roughness") penned the script, which is set in the modern-day South and tells the story of a wife and mistress who find out about one another and then conspire to murder the cheating husband.

"One's the wife, one's the one he's messing around with — and you root for them both, because it's not their fault. He's lying to both of them," Underwood says of the devilish song she penned with Hillary Lindsey and Josh Kear for her "Blown Away" album.
"They figure it out, and what do they do about it? They kill him! And the first time they meet is at the funeral. There's two black Cadillacs, and you think maybe that's the car he bought for both of them .... It's dark, it's stormy, it's dramatic — it's like a soap opera."

This will be Underwood's first time to produce a television project, moving behind-the-scenes after her starring role on NBC's live television production of "The Sound of Music." Another new job on her horizon: motherhood. The country superstar announced this week she is expecting her first child in the spring.
