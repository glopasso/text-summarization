The Transportation Security Administration issued a statement Thursday signaling its intention to focus on insulated beverage containers, noting growing concerns that terrorists might conceal explosives inside such items.
The announcement came during the Christmas holiday, traditionally one of the busier times at airports nationwide.
Passengers can still carry insulated beverage containers through security and onto flights, the federal agency noted.
But, the statement noted, airport security officers alerted passengers that they will observe "additional security measures ... in the coming days" on such items.
The agency said that it is "carefully monitoring information related to terrorist tactics and working with out international partners to share information."
Still, the statement did not offer any details on what, specifically, provoked the latest change in security tactics.
