Icon is a monthly arts series that promises viewers a journey into the worlds of visual arts, architecture, literature, music, photography, dance, opera, fashion and design, accompanied by interviews with their innovators and influencers as diverse as I.M. Pei, Quincy Jones and Herbie Hancock.
The new program will examine how classic cultural icons have influenced new trends and ideas, and will challenge itself and its viewers to identify new icons in the making.
The global remit of the show takes viewers to the Louvre and the Guggenheim, the Tate and the Turner Prize, the Bolshoi and the Met and the Venice Biennale and Fashion Weeks in a fresh, intelligent and accessible way.
It sees presenter Monita Rajpal stepping into the frame of the designer's studio, going behind the camera and onto the catwalk under the watchful eye of iconic guests and trendspotters who share their insights and reveal their influences.
