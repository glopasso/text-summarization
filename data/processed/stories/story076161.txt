The two bodyguards injured in an attack on a convoy transporting Britain's ambassador in Libya are "safe and in good condition," an embassy representative in Tripoli said Tuesday.
The incident took place Monday in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi.
One of the guards is in stable condition. Another had surgery and will leave a hospital Tuesday, the representative said.
Ambassador Dominic Asquith, who was not hurt in the attack, is in Tripoli, and the "whole staff is safe and sound," the representative said.
The attack occurred near a university, Libya's state news agency LANA reported, citing a spokesman for the Supreme Security Committee in Benghazi.
"It was clearly involved in a serious incident, but we cannot confirm if there was an RPG (rocket-propelled grenade) attack, but shots were fired," a British Foreign Office spokesman said.
Libya's Interior Ministry condemned the attack as a "criminal act that serves the enemies of Libya" and portrays a negative image of the internal security situation.
It issued directives to increase security around embassies and foreign missions in Libya. The ministry asked all diplomatic missions in Libya to inform security forces of their movements within Libya so they are provided with security.
