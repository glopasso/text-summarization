(CNN)Enjoy the latest pictures of the former Kate Middleton. They're the last you'll see for a while.
The Duchess of Cambridge made her last official appearance Friday at a variety of spots across London, enjoying tours of a learning center and a church that hosts a youth charity.
The former, the Stephen Lawrence Centre, is named for an aspiring architect who was stabbed to death at age 18 in 1993. His mother, Baroness Lawrence, escorted Catherine and her husband, Prince William, around the facility.
Catherine, 33, is scheduled to give birth in mid- to late April, she said this month.
It will be the second child for her and Prince William, 32. Their son, Prince George, was born in July 2013.
