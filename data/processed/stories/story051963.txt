Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN)Pakistani authorities have arrested a suspect in the December 16 attack on a public school in Peshawar that left more than 140 people dead, most of them children.
Taj Muhammad, also known as Rizwan, is accused of commanding one of the Taliban units that laid siege to the Army Public School. The military says he has confessed to other attacks in the same area.
Taliban militants ambushed the school, explosives strapped to their bodies, and burst into an auditorium filled with students taking exams.
They sprayed bullets rapidly, killing 145 people. Of those, 132 were children, authorities said.
The terror group had warned Muslims to avoid places with military ties, saying it carried out the attack to avenge the deaths of children allegedly killed by the nation's army strikes in tribal areas.
The army school is home to about 1,100 students and staff, most of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar.
CNN's Sophia Saifi reported from Islamabad, and Mariano Castillo reported from Atlanta.
