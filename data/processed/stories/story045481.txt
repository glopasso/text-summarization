A painting by artist Francis Bacon sold for $142,405,000 on Tuesday, breaking the record as the most expensive piece of art ever auctioned, according to a statement from the auction house.
"Three Studies of Lucian Freud" was sold after six minutes of bidding in the room and on the phone at Christie's in New York City, according to spokeswoman Elizabeth Van Bergen.
Painted in 1969, it is known as one of Bacon's most iconic works, as it features Lucian Freud at the apex of his relationship with Bacon, according to the auction house's statement.
