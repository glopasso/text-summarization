Have you ever watched a movie scene and thought to yourself, "that could never happen in real life?" The creatives behind New York prank collective Improv Everywhere haven't.
Instead, the group has made it its mission to re-enact famous scenes from movies -- romantic comedies, action, fantasy films, you name it -- in ordinary situations.
The group's most recent stunt took place at Katz's Delicatessen, the setting for the classic fake orgasm scene in 1989's "When Harry Met Sally."
Meg Ryan's Sally was proving a point to Billy Crystal's Harry that women can indeed simulate pleasure without actually being satisfied, and her performance was so convincing, another customer wanted to "have what she's having."
But what would happen if that scenario was repeated in real life? Better yet, what would happen if not one, but 20 women pretended to orgasm simultaneously in the middle of Katz's lunch rush?
Improv Everywhere set to find out.
The organization says on its website that the employees at Katz weren't aware that a loud, uninhibited flash mob had descended on the restaurant, but everyone seemed to be amused by the show.
"When Harry Met Sally" isn't the only film Improv Everywhere has experimented with. Their other "Movies in Real Life" segments include "Back to the Future," "Indiana Jones" and "Lord of the Rings."
