Two "Dancing With the Stars" contestants are on the mend from injuries.
On Monday night's show, contestant Amy Purdy landed in the hospital with a back injury following her performance with pro dancer Derek Hough. The 34-year-old athlete had won high scores from the show's judges with her rumba, but after the routine, she said, she "turned wrong" and then found herself in a world of pain.
"Right after judging I kind of turned my head and my back cracked and it just seized up," Purdy said. "Everything's really painful right now, it's hard to breathe."
Later Purdy tweeted that she was "in pain but I'm in good hands."
Because of her injury, Purdy sat out a group routine and "Dancing With the Stars" ran rehearsal footage instead.
Purdy tweeted that she isn't sure whether she'll be able to return to the competition next week, but she's hopeful and excited for the routine she and Hough are scheduled to perform.
The Paralympic snowboarder isn't the only "Dancing" contestant whose hard work on the dance floor has led to offstage pain. During an April 24 rehearsal, Danica McKellar broke a rib.
The former "Wonder Years" actress was still recovering when she performed on Monday, but she said support from her fans helped her pull through.
"It's sore, but it's OK," McKellar said after her routine. "You fight through it and do your best."
