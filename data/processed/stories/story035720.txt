A Northern California woman was arrested on suspicion of taking a bite out of two kids in the children's section of a bookstore, police said.
Polly Beltramo, 46, of Palo Alto, is accused of biting a 2-year-old girl and a baby boy on the cheek at BookBuyers in Mountain View on Thursday, police said.
The incident began when Beltramo allegedly bit the girl, whose mother was in the children's section of the store, witnesses said.
Bookstore owner Rammurti Reed said he heard the girl screaming and saw a red welt on her cheek.
"Suddenly a little boy, who was just a couple of months old, started screaming," Reed told CNN affiliate KGO-TV. "I went to him and his cheek was bleeding."
Beltramo allegedly fled the store and was later found at a nearby coffee shop, police said.
Beltramo has been arrested on felony child abuse, police said.
