The suspect in Friday's shooting of six people in a downtown high-rise is a 40-year-old man with economic woes that include a recent bankruptcy filing, federal records show.
In his filing last May for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, under which he sought to have his assets liquidated and his debts discharged, Jason S. Rodriguez listed his assets at $4,675 and his liabilities at $89,873.31.
His 2002 Nissan XTerra with 110,000 miles represented $4,000 of those assets. His personal property filing described the vehicle as having body damage on the right side, an air conditioner that did not work and a transmission that was slipping.
He said his monthly income as a "sandwich artist" at a Subway Restaurant in Orlando, where he had worked for nine months, was $890.67, and he listed his monthly expenses at $815.
A man who answered the phone at the restaurant referred a caller to company headquarters, where spokesman Kevin Kane confirmed that Rodriguez had worked for the company, but left six weeks ago. Kane said the company has a job title of "sandwich artist."
Before leaving Subway, Rodriguez's income had already taken a hit, dropping from $27,686 in 2007 to $13,936 in 2008.
Rodriguez estimated the value of his household goods -- a TV, microwave, bed, computer, dresser, two night stands, etc. -- at $500 and said his girlfriend owned the remaining household goods.
He faced an $11,085 claim of child support.
In addition, he was behind on his rent ($1,402.05), owed $450 to American Express, $110 to AT&T for his cell phone service and $343 to Florida Hospital Orlando for unspecified medical services, the document said.
Among his creditors were the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid 2005 and 2006 taxes totaling $2,415.
The largest debts were for student loans -- $8,500 to Wachovia, $28,912 to Sallie Mae.
Orlando lawyer Charlie Price represented Rodriguez in his case. "It's not that atypical from most everyone I see," he told CNN in a telephone interview. "That's how it is right now. He's a very typical client. Of people that are suffering through the economy right now, there's nothing extraordinary about him ... except that."
Price said he had had no contact with Rodriguez for several months, and added that his former client did not owe him money.
