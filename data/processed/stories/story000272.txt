Scratch Christian Bale off the list of actors supposed to play Steve Jobs.
Bale was rumored to be the finalist to play the Apple co-founder in the Aaron Sorkin-written film biography but decided he wasn't right for the part, said The Hollywood Reporter.
The Jobs biopic has been in the works since at least 2012, when Sony announced that Sorkin would write a film based on Walter Isaacson's best-selling biography.
Bale is the second notable performer to turn down the Jobs role. Leonardo DiCaprio was also pegged for the film. The Hollywood Reporter noted that neither Bale nor DiCaprio had begun negotiations.
According to Variety, Seth Rogen is being talked about for the part of Steve Wozniak, Jobs' Apple co-founder.
The film is to be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for "Slumdog Millionaire." Filming was scheduled to begin this winter.
