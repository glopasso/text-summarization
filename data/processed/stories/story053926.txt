Boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. was booked Friday into the Clark County, Nevada, detention center to serve a 90-day sentence for a conviction last year on a domestic violence charge, police said.
The high-profile athlete will be kept in isolation from the facility's 3,000 other inmates. "He will receive one hour free time per day by himself," the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said in a news release.
The undefeated boxer was convicted after police said he punched the mother of his children at his home.
Mayweather had been set to go to jail earlier this year, but a Nevada judge pushed back his reporting date so that the boxer could compete last month against WBA super-welterweight champion Miguel Cotto. Mayweather, whose nickname is "Money," won a unanimous decision in the Las Vegas fight, which paid him $32 million.
A Michigan native, Mayweather has won seven titles in various weight classes since turning pro in 1996.
A picture posted on his website and dated Thursday showed Mayweather seated on a footstool and leaning back on a pillow as he received a pedicure.
