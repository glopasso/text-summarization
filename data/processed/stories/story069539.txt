Country music star Wynonna Judd's new husband lost his left leg in a motorcycle crash in South Dakota Saturday, a statement from her publicist said Monday.
The accident happened as Judd, 48, and Michael Scott "Cactus" Moser went for a ride together on separate bikes before her scheduled concert in Deadwood, South Dakota, the publicist said.
"Moser's left leg was severed at the scene of the accident and doctors in Rapid City, South Dakota, amputated the leg above the knee," the statement said. "He has also undergone surgery to his hand."
Judd and Moser, who is the drummer in her band, married on her Tennessee farm on June 10. Moser is well known for his work in the band Highway 101, which had several hits on the country charts in the 1980s.
"Moser collided with an oncoming vehicle and was transported to a local hospital," the statement said. "He is being treated for serious but non-life-threatening injuries. Wynonna was not involved in the accident."
Judd has postponed next week's concerts in Canada to stay by the side of her husband.
"The outpouring of prayer and support from friends, family and fans has been a blessing to both Cactus and I," Judd said. "Cactus is a champion. I love him deeply and I will not leave his side."
