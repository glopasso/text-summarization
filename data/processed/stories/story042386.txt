Gunfire rang out outside a Miami funeral home, killing two people and injuring 12 others, police said.
Investigators from the Miami-Dade County Police Department's homicide bureau continued their probe Saturday, one day after the mass shooting took place.
The bloodshed occurred around 9:30 p.m. Friday at the Monique and Loriston Community Funeral Home in North Miami, "while funeral services were taking place," according to a press release issued the Saturday by police.
Fourteen people were struck by bullets, with one dying at the scene and another succumbing to his wounds at a nearby hospital, police said. The victims' identifies were not immediately released, though authorities did say they were 43 and 27 years old.
Those wounded include a 5-year-old girl, who was transported to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital. She was listed in stable condition on Saturday, according to police.
Authorities did not offer further information in their statement, besides saying that a "white vehicle may be involved" somehow in the incident.
