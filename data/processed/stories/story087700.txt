An 80-year-old Japanese man on Thursday became the oldest person to reach the top of Mt. Everest, officials said.
Yuichiro Miura reached the top of Everest Thursday morning with his physician son Gota, mountaineering official Gyanendra Shrestha said from the base of Everest.
Miura's achievement eclipses that of a Nepali man who climbed Everest at age 76 in 2008.
The oldest woman to climb Everest is also a Japanese. She was 73 when she reached the top last year.
Miura broke his hip in an accident two years ago, and he underwent heart surgery in January.
"I am still healthy and strong. I think I have a good chance to reach the summit of Everest," he said via phone earlier this month.
To prepare, Miura walked three times a week with loads of 25 to 30 kilograms (55 to 66 lbs) on his back.
He reached the top of the 8,848-meter (29,035-foot) peak twice before: in 2003 at age 70, and in 2008 at age 75.
"I have a dream to climb Everest at this age," he said. "If you have a dream, never give up. Dreams come true."
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the first expedition to reach the summit of Everest: Sir Edmund Hilary and Tenzing Norgay made it to the top of the mountain on May 29, 1953.
Earlier this month, a 27-year-old graphic designer has made history by becoming the first Saudi woman to conquer the mount.
