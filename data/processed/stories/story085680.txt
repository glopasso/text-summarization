Amal Alamuddin, George Clooney's new wife, is now Amal Clooney, according to her law firm's website.
It's unclear whether the new Mrs. Clooney is using her maiden name as a middle name, making her Amal Alamuddin Clooney, or keeping it short and sweet as Amal Clooney.
The Lebanese-born British attorney, 36, married Clooney in September in a private ceremony in Venice. It was a second marriage for the actor, who was married from 1989 until 1993 to "No Strings Attached" actress Talia Balsam.
Amal Alamuddin was a well-known name even before she scooped up Hollywood's most eligible bachelor. She "specialises in international law, human rights, criminal law and extradition," according to her Legal 500 profile, and has represented clients like WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange when he was resisting an extradition request by Sweden. She's even worked as an adviser to judges in Yugoslavia and a prosecutor in Lebanon.
What we know about Mrs. Clooney
Vanity Fair reports the couple spent their honeymoon at a country home (ahem, mansion) 50 miles west of London. But Clooney took a quick trip to New York last week to promote his upcoming movie "Tomorrowland" at Comic Con.
