Former FIFA presidential hopeful Mohamed Bin Hammam believes that soccer's ruling body has already decided he is guilty of bribery.
The ex-head of the Asian Football Confederation was suspended pending an investigation on May 29, having been accused of trying to buy votes in his bid to win the July 1 election against incumbent Sepp Blatter.
FIFA's ethics committee has begun a two-day hearing to decide the Qatari's fate, and the 62-year-old is pessimistic ahead of the verdict.
"I want you all to know that my legal team and I remain confident that the case and the evidence presented against me are weak and unsubstantiated," Bin Hammam said via his official website on Friday.
Bin Hammam wants a "fair FIFA hearing"
"They are flimsy and will not stand up to scrutiny in any court of law; that has been clear throughout this process and it remains to be so.
"I am not confident that the hearing will be conducted in the manner any of us would like. It seems likely that FIFA has already made its decision weeks ago. So, none of us should be completely surprised if a guilty verdict is returned."
Bin Hammam vowed to clear his name if he is found guilty.
"Justice will eventually prevail whether through the FIFA ethics committee, the Court of Arbitration of Sport or, if necessary, through other courts or legal proceedings in courts where we will be equal and no special privileges will be granted to either party."
FIFA set date for Bin Hammam verdict
Bin Hammam withdrew from the presidential election in the wake of the accusations, with Blatter maintaining the position for a fourth term.
Jack Warner, the former head of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, faced similar charges to Bin Hammam.
The investigation into Warner was stopped, with his innocence presumed, after the Trinidadian resigned in June.
