Kenyan warplanes targeted an Al-Shabaab training camp today inside Somalia, according to military officials. The al Qaeda-linked Islamist group has been connected to the attack in a Nairobi mall last month where 67 people where killed.
Col. Cyrus Oguna, spokesman for the Kenyan Defense Force, told CNN that the training camp had about 300 recruits, but he doesn't know yet how many people were killed in this attack. He said that information would be available Friday.
"This military operation is not an isolated one, but we will continue targeting Al-Shabaab camps in the near future" Cyrus Oguna said.
The attack was in Diinsoor, Southwestern Somalia.

The airstrike completely destroyed an Al-Shabaab training camp at Hurguun, according to the military.
Kenyan officials said the terror group has used the training camp to train operatives, including attackers who targeted Nairobi's Westgate mall in September.
This offensive comes on the heels of the Jillib attack, which left two Al-Shabaab commanders dead, the Kenyan military said.
