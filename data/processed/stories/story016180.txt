(EW.com) -- Martin Lawrence could be coming back to prime-time TV next fall.
CBS has given one of the "Bad Boys" actor-comedian's projects a pilot order. The untitled project stars Lawrence as a widowed father of two teenagers who, after losing his job in construction, decides to go to the police academy and become a cop at the age of 46.
You could see why CBS would be drawn to the concept. This is a network built on cop dramas. Why not get a cop comedy going too?
Mike Lisbe and Nate Reger ("Just Shoot Me," "$*#! My Dad Says") will write and executive produce, with Michael Green and Sam Maydew from the Collective as EPs.
