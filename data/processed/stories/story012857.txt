Which television series is so good it's worth binge-watching from beginning to end?
This question was posed over the weekend on the social networking website Reddit, where community members can solicit feedback from others on topics of their choosing. Judging from the responses, it seems that a variety of factors make a show binge-worthy, making different shows worth binging on for different reasons.
Some of the most popular selections -- like "Deadwood," "Orphan Black" and "Stargate: SG1" -- had ongoing narratives and gripping cliffhangers at the end of each episode that left viewers anxious to find out what's next. Watching densely layered shows like those on a compressed cycle also minimizes the risk of forgetting key details or plot points that comes with waiting a week in between episodes.
On the other end of the spectrum, viewers recommended fun and breezy comedies like "Peep Show" and "Silicon Valley," which require little investment of time or attention but deliver big on laughs and entertainment.
Popular shows that had short runs, like "Firefly" or "Freaks and Geeks," also make compelling candidates if you can avoid getting emotionally attached.
This list has been cherry-picked from the exhaustive thread started on Reddit, so it is by no means exhaustive. Tell us in the comments what would you add to this list.
