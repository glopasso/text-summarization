An armed man is holding several people hostage in the German city of Ingolstadt, police said Monday.
The hostage taker did not make any immediate demands from the city's Old Town Hall, police spokesman Guenther Beck said.
As police dealt with the hostage situation, German Chancellor Angela Merkel canceled an election speech that she had planned to give in the city Monday afternoon. She'd been scheduled to appear with the prime minister of Bavaria, Horst Seehofer.
Beck said that as far as he knew, the hostage situation had nothing to do with Merkel's planned visit.
