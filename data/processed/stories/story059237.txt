Attacks on military posts and police stations in Iraq claimed at least 21 lives Thursday.
At least three Iraqi soldiers were killed and eight others wounded when a suicide bomber driving a mini-truck loaded with explosives hit an Iraqi military post in the town of Shirqat, police in Tikrit said. The town is located about 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Baghdad.
Hours later, two parked car bombs targeting Iraqi army patrols exploded within 30 minutes of each other in Falluja. The blasts killed two Iraqi soldiers and wounded 10 others, police and hospital officials said. Falluja is a Sunni town, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad.
In a separate attack, shooting and roadside bomb explosions in northeast Baghdad killed 16 people, including six Iraqi soldiers and three policemen, and wounded 14 others, officials said.
Clashes erupted between Iraqi security forces and insurgents in the Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya at about 8:30 p.m. Thursday, wounding 10 people, officials said. Iraqi security forces imposed a curfew in neighborhood and searched for the attackers.
