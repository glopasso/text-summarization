(EW.com) -- Is putting naked and famous people in music videos the only way veteran indie bands can get attention anymore?
Not long after the Flaming Lips got a Badu or two to get naked in their latest clip, Icelandic indie act Sigur Ros is unveiling a never-before-seen short film by Lars von Trier their new video for "Fjögur Píanó" — and it features a lot of Shia LaBeouf. Like, all of him.
According the the press release, the Alma Har'el-directed video is meant to depict "a man and woman locked in a never-ending cycle of addiction and desire."
Incidentally, it also depicts Shia LaBeouf's penis, so, you know.
