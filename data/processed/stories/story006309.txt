A U.S. Marine was being held Monday on a warship after the slaying of a transgender woman in the Philippines.
Because no charges have yet been filed, officials have not identified the Marine, who is assigned to 2nd Battalion, 9th Marines, out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
"The Marine Corps is working closely and cooperating fully with the Philippine National Police to ensure a thorough investigation is completed and due process of law is followed," Col. Brad Bartelt, spokesman with the U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said in a statement.
A State Department spokesperson identified the deceased as Jeffrey Laude, also known as Jennifer.
Her body, which showed signs of strangulation, was found shortly before midnight Saturday, according to Marine Corps Times.
Three other Marines from the same unit as the Marine being detained have been identified as potential witnesses, the newspaper reported, citing an internal Navy memo on the incident. They are also being held.
