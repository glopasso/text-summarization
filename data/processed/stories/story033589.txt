It's time again for the Primetime Emmy Awards, being held in Los Angeles on Sunday, September 22. And what better way to celebrate than with some of the most surprising stats involving the awards?
Emmy Awards are named after "Immy," an abbreviation for the image orthicon tube, part of an early television camera. It was later changed to Emmy. This year is the 65th annual ceremony.
Disclaimer: There was not a statistic for the percentage of actors and show teams who are sincere when they say it is an honor just to be nominated.
