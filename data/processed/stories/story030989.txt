(Rolling Stone) -- This unholy mess replaces the artful ambition of "The American" with torture, blood spray, kinky sex, twisted fun and a bizarro critique of U.S. policy on illegal immigration.
It's a digital gorefest that expands on the faux trailer Robert Rodriguez included in "Grindhouse," the 2007 exploitation epic he unleashed with pal Quentin Tarantino.
Peter Travers reviews "Machete" in his weekly video series, "At the Movies With Peter Travers."
Rodriguez and co-director Ethan Maniquis revel in the glorious sight of Mexican-American actor Danny Trejo as "Machete," a former federale out to kill a drug lord (a never-lumpier Steven Seagal) and assassinate a corrupt Texas senator (a never-hammier Robert De Niro).
Trejo, 66, looks like four miles of torn-up road, but here he is convincingly kicking pretty-boy ass and bedding hotties such as Jessica Alba, Michelle Rodriguez and Lindsay Lohan.
Is he redeemed? Your senses will be too numb to care. Just to hear Trejo deadpan the line "Machete don't text" is tasty compensation.
