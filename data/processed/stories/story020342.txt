Venus Williams' latest tennis outfit -- a revealing black-lace corset dress with bright red straps -- has caused controversy since she wore it for her first round match at the French Open.
But this is not the first time the wardrobe choices of Venus and her younger sister Serena have come under the spotlight.
Ever since the pair appeared on the WTA Tour in the 1990's -- complete with multi-colored braided hair -- they have been setting, and sometimes destroying,  trends with their extroverted dress sense.
From Serena's denim skirt and boot combo to Venus's designer dresses, there isn't much that the sisters have not tried to wear on the court.
However, not all their outfits have been popular with the critics, least of all Venus's lace number and the skin-colored shorts that she wears underneath, which has caused quite a stir in Paris.
Whatever you think of their fashion there is no doubt the Williams sisters eye-catching ensembles bring some much needed glamor to the women's game.
CNN takes a look back at the best and worst of the sisters' fashions over the years.
