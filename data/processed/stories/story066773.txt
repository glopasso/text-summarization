A 35-year-old woman on a first date plummeted to her death early Thursday morning when she fell from the balcony of her 17th floor New York City apartment.
Jennifer Rosoff went outside on her balcony around 12:50 a.m. Thursday to talk and smoke a cigarette with her date when the balcony's railing broke, according to police.
It's unclear whether Rosoff leaned on the balcony, causing it to give way.
She landed on a second-story construction scaffolding of the building and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.
Rosoff's employer, online advertising startup TripleLift, released a statement expressing sorrow at the news of her death.
"We are all deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of our dear friend and co-worker," the statement said. "Her tremendous energy and humor brought so much joy to the office."
Richard Dansereau, managing director of Stonehenge Management LLC, the company that manages the building, also released a statement.
"This is a tragedy, and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of Ms. Rosoff," he said. "We are cooperating fully with the investigation into the cause of this terrible accident."
A statement provided to CNN from the New York City Department of Buildings said the agency is investigating and issued a vacate order for all balconies in the building as a precaution.
According to her Linkedin profile, Rosoff worked as director of sales at TripleLift for the past five months and had previously held positions at The New Yorker, Conde Nast and Cosmopolitan magazine.
