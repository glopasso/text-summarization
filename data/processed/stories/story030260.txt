Somewhere out there, a lucky person -- or two -- may be walking around with a ticket to easy street in his or her pocket, purse or sock drawer.
The Powerball numbers are out. Time to check and see if you made the lucky pick that will change your life forever. That would be:
58, 5, 25, 59, 30 ... and Powerball number 32.
If you bought a ticket, your chances of cracking Wednesday night's $448 million Powerball jackpot are 1 in 175 million.
But who cares about odds, when you've actually won almost the equivalent of the net worth of Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods? (According to Forbes Magazine.)
The size of U.S. lottery jackpots are growing, with almost no end in sight.
"You could see maybe in the next several years ... an elusive billion-dollar jackpot," said Victor Matheson, economics professor at College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts.
If no one has the winning combo, the prize will be an estimated $600 million for Saturday's drawing, according to the Multi-State Lottery Association.
Powerball is played in 43 states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A single ticket costs $2.
The largest lottery jackpot in U.S. history was $656 million in the Mega Millions game in March 2012. That was split among three tickets sold in Illinois, Kansas and Maryland. In case you do win it all Wednesday night, a $245 million lump sum can give you some choices.
How about nearly 100 high-speed Bugatti Veyrons? You can run away from all those relatives and friends asking for a loan.
