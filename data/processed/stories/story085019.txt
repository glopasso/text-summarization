A Texas firm has recalled about 2,600 pounds of fully cooked, ready-to-eat smoked turkey breast products because they may be contaminated with bacteria that can cause a potentially fatal disease.
The products by the New Braunfels Smokehouse were distributed nationwide, including via catalog and Internet sales, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said Sunday.
The meat may be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, the agency said.
The products subject to recall are:
-- 1-pound packages of New Braunfels Smokehouse Sliced Smoked Turkey, with the package code "2210" on the label.
-- 4- to 6-pound packages of New Braunfels Honey-Glazed Spiral Sliced Smokehouse Hickory Smoked Boneless Breast of Turkey, with the package code "2180" on the label.

-- 4- to 6-pound whole breast packages of Stegall Spiral Sliced Hickory Smoked Turkey Breast, with the package codes "2180" or "2210" on the label.
Each package bears the USDA mark of inspection and the number "P-975" inside the mark of inspection.
The items were produced on August 4.
