(WIRED) -- If you're a die-hard baseball or basketball fan, Steve Jobs just made your day.
With its latest software update for Apple TV, Apple is now offering easy streaming of MLB and NBA games directly through its $100 media-streaming unit. All you need an active subscription to either service, and you can have unlimited access to every baseball and basketball game through your Apple TV, subject to local blackout rules, of course.
MLB.TV streaming had previously been available for Roku and PlayStation 3, but built-in Apple TV functionality brings an ease of use and integration previously unseen.
There are two subscription models for MLB.TV, $100 a year for standard and $120 for the premium offering (which boasts home and away broadcasts, in-game DVR capability, and different camera options).
NBA League Pass has also been available for online streaming and directly mobile apps for Android and iOS, and the Apple TV bundle comes in two sizes: a $65 option if you pick seven teams to watch, as well as $100 for unlimited streaming.
(Although, real penny-pinchers could just purchase the mobile version, which costs $70 less than the Apple TV version, and just AirPlay that to your HDTV, another new feature of iOS 4.3.)
How much more business will the move bring in for Apple, MLB and the NBA? Millions of dollars over time, although much more Apple TV penetration will be needed before that comes to bear.
(It's been less than three months since the company announced sales of 1 million Apple TVs.)
But if you're a sports fan who has been hesitant to plunk down a Benjamin for Apple's media-streaming marvel, this update just made your resistance all the more futile.
