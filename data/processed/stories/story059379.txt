"Grey's Anatomy" star Patrick Dempsey believes he and a group of investors are just what the doctor ordered for a struggling Seattle-based coffee chain.
Dempsey said the group wants to save 500 jobs by purchasing Tully's Coffee, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October. The company, citing "rising commodity prices and challenging lease economics," said it planned to close a number of underperforming coffee shop locations as part of its reorganization.
"I'm excited about the opportunity to save hundreds of jobs, give back to Seattle and become a larger part of the economic growth and fabric of the community," the actor said in a statement released Wednesday.
Tully's Coffee confirmed Thursday that Dempsey is part of an investment group, but had no comment on the effort.
"We will know by 5 (p,m.) today how many bids have been submitted," marketing director Diane Geurts said. "The (bankruptcy) auction takes place on January 3 and the final hearing is on January 11."
The hunky Dempsey plays Derek Shepherd, nicknamed "Dr. McDreamy," on the TV series. The medical drama's setting is Seattle.
"I've always loved this city, and with the purchase of Tully's Coffee, I plan to spend a lot of time in Seattle and at the stores connecting with the community and growing the Tully's brand," Dempsey said. "It looks like Seattle may be my home away from home in the very near future."
According to Dempsey, Tully's Coffee operates 47 locations in Washington and California with other franchises across the country.
The bankruptcy filing did not affect Tully's Coffee online sales and wholesale business, which were purchased in 2009 by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters.
