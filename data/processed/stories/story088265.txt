Agnieszka Radwanska has beaten Maria Sharapova in the final of the Miami Masters to claim her second title of the year.
The Pole's straight sets 7-5 6-4 victory over the world No.2 on Saturday is the biggest of her career to date and moves her up to fourth in the world rankings.
The 23-year-old, who didn't drop a set throughout the tournament, now joins world No.1 Victoria Azarenka as the only woman to have won multiple titles on the WTA Tour in 2012.
"I got a lot of good wins this year against top players. I was trying from the beginning to focus on my serve, put my first serve in and go for it. I think I did a really good job today and the serve was the key." Radwanska said afterwards.

Radwanska needed 57 minutes to clinch a first set marked by few winners and a string of unforced errors.
Sharapova's tally of 26 compared with Radwanska's eight eventually told as the Pole broke the Russian's serve in the 12th game.

Despite being less error-strewn the second set took a similar course with Sharapova -- who has now lost four finals in Miami -- losing her serve in the 10th game to hand Radwanska the title.
"I thought she played extremely well, was very consistent, got that extra ball back and I made that extra mistake. She didn't give me many errors," Sharapova said.
The victory is the Pole's second victory over Sharapova in nine meetings -- the only other triumph came at the U.S. Open in 2007.
The win adds to the title she won in Dubai last month where she defeated Germany's Julia Goerges in the final.
