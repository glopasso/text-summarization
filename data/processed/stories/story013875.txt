Florida authorities issued an alert late Wednesday night for a 12-year-old girl that police believe was abducted in Virginia by the boyfriend of her dead mother.
The Amber Alert in Florida listed information about Brittany Smith and the man police believe abducted her.
Authorities in Virginia  launched a search for the seventh-grader Monday after officers found  the body of Brittany's mother, Tina Smith, 41, inside the family's Salem home.
Tina Smith's co-workers contacted police after the woman failed to show up for work Monday morning.
Virginia  police said earlier that the girl was abducted by Jeffrey Scott Easley,  32, who met the girl's mother on the Internet.
They do not know if Brittany went with Easley  willingly. The pair may be seeking refuge in another state, Roanoke County Police Chief Ray Lavinder told reporters.
Police have obtained a felony abduction warrant for Easley.
Along with Florida, police in Virginia say they are working with authorities in North Carolina, Alabama, West Virginia,  Kentucky and Ohio to issue alerts in their states for the  missing vehicle and Easley and Brittany.
Tearful relatives sent messages of love and concern Wednesday night to the 12-year-old girl.
"I prayed  for you everyday since I found out you were gone and will continue to  pray until you are found and returned to us," Brittany's cousin, Kim  Stephenson, said at an evening press conference.
Police  have said the key is finding a silver 2005 Dodge Neon four-door sedan  with Virginia tag XKF-2365 that belonged to the girl's dead mother.
Easley,  a 265-pound white male, is 5 feet, 11 inches tall, has brown hair and  hazel eyes, the Amber Alert says. Brittany Smith is 5 feet tall, weighs  100 pounds, and has straight brown hair and brown eyes.
They have asked anyone with information to call 911 or Roanoke County police at 540-777-8641.
