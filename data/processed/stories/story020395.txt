(CNN)What do we have for the contestant on "The Price Is Right"?
A brand-new car!
Whoops. That wasn't supposed to happen.
On Thursday's edition of the popular game show, model Manuela Arbelaez accidentally revealed the correct answer to a guessing game for a new Hyundai Sonata.
Host Drew Carey couldn't stop laughing.
"Congratulations! Manuela just gave you a car!" he exulted.
Arbelaez was mortified, attempting to hide behind the display.
But everything turned out OK, she tweeted later.
It's been a busy week for "The Price Is Right." On Wednesday, former host Bob Barker, 91, showed up to run his old show.
