A magnitude 5.7 earthquake rattled central Japan on Monday afternoon, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. A second quake -- magnitude 4.6 quake -- struck about 11 minutes later.
The Japan Meteorological Agency said no tsunami alert has been issued.
The quake, which took place at 4:24 p.m. local time, was centered about 143 kilometers (89 miles) north-northwest of Tokyo at a depth of 9.9 kilometers (6.2 miles), according to the USGS.
CNN's Tokyo bureau felt a "slight shake" from the temblor.
