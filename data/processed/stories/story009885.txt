A British soldier who was reported missing from a checkpoint in Afghanistan early Monday was found dead later in the day, the British Ministry of Defense announced.
"It is with great sadness that I announce the death of a soldier from The Highlanders, 4th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland," said Lt. Col. Tim Purbrick, spokesman for Task Force Helmand, in a statement.
After an "extensive search," fellow members of NATO's International Security Assistance Force found his body in the Nahr-e Saraj District of Helmand Province, Purbrick said.
The soldier had suffered gunshot wounds. His identity was not immediately released.
A spokeswoman for David Cameron said the British prime minister is "deeply saddened by this news."
