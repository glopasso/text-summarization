It's not the Oscars, Emmys, Tonys or even the People's Choice Awards, but there was quite a swirl of competition for those vying to be named king of the potty.
The storied Varsity Theater in Minneapolis has taken the crown as winner of this year's Cintas' America's Best Restroom Contest.
"Cintas launched the America's Best Restroom Contest twelve years ago to raise awareness of the importance of hygiene and to salute those businesses which strive for restroom excellence in both function and design," said John Engel, Cintas' senior marketing manager, in a press statement.
Cintas sells hygiene products and services to businesses that cater to the public, including hotels, restaurants and airports. None of the 10 finalists are Cintas customers, said a spokesman.
