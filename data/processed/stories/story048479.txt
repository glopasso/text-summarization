And we thought Christian Bale's Batman was buff.
Director Zack Snyder showed off his version of the crime-fighting superhero Tuesday on Twitter with the first images of Ben Affleck as Batman in the upcoming sequel to "Man of Steel."
Snyder teased on Monday that a reveal of the Batmobile was coming, but he snuck in a look at Affleck as a surprise.
The project, which is being referred to as "Batman vs. Superman," is the first time the two superheroes will be on the big screen together.
Henry Cavill, who bore the "S" on his chest for "Man of Steel," will again play the man from Krypton.
Given how controversial Affleck's casting was, it's no surprise that critics have been eager to weigh in. But to some, it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be.
What do you think of Affleck as the new Dark Knight? Snyder's "Man of Steel" sequel is scheduled to arrive in theaters in May 2016.
