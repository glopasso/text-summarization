Sachin Tendulkar will attempt to become the first cricketer to score 100 international centuries on Friday as India continue to fight back in the third Test against the West Indies in Mumbai.
The 38-year-old "Little Master" will resume on 67 on the fourth day in his home city as he seeks to pass three figures for the first time since March.
He has scored 51 tons in 183 five-day Tests, and 48 in 453 one-day internationals -- holding the record number of runs scored in both formats of the game.
In the opening match of the current three-match series he became the first player to pass 15,000 Test runs, and has helped top-ranked India take an unbeatable 2-0 lead.
The home side responded to the Windies' first innings of 590 by reaching 281-3 at stumps on Thursday, with Rahul Dravid becoming only the second player after Tendulkar to pass 13,000 runs as he made 82.
Gautam Gambhir put on 67 for the first wicket with Virender Sehwag (37) before falling for 55.
Dravid came to the crease at 138-2, and added 86 with Tendulkar before falling short of his 37th Test hundred and 49th overall.
V.V.S. Laxman kept the momentum going with a brisk 32 off 53 balls as he and Tendulkar put on an unbroken 57.
Tendulkar, who has scored seven tons against the Caribbean team in all formats of the game, registered his 63rd half-century in Tests as he hit five fours and a six from 133 balls faced.
He survived a scare on 38 when he was dropped by Carlton Baugh.
The West Indies' final pair lasted only 3.1 overs at the start of the day, adding 15 runs to the team's overnight total of 575-9.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin bowled Devendra Bishoo for 12 to earn the 25-year-old's second five-wicket haul of his debut series, ending with figures of 5-156, while Fidel Edwards was 11 not out.
Gambhir said the Indians were focused on avoiding the follow-on target of 390.
"The team is not thinking much about Sachin's 100th hundred, but what we require at the moment. West Indies have set a big target and it's important to save the follow-on," told the Cricinfo website.
"If Sachin gets his 100th ton in that course it's good, but we are focused on the team objective."
