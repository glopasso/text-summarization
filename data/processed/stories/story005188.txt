The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for an early Wednesday morning attack on a police station that killed two officers and injured seven others, a spokesman for the militant group told CNN.
Approximately 10 militants charged the police station, tossed grenades and then opened fire in the predawn attack, said senior police official Sohail Khalid.
The militants escaped after an hour-long firefight with police, Khalid said.
The attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan, a district that sits next to Pakistan's militant-plagued tribal region along the Afghan border.
It comes one day after Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan denied reports that the militant group had declared a cease-fire while holding peace talks with the government.
Wednesday morning's attack was proof that reports of the cease-fire were false, Ehsan told CNN by phone.
