(The Hollywood Reporter)The all-new, all-female Ghostsbusters are here.
Melissa McCarthy, who was already in talks for one of the leads, has signed on for the Paul Feig-directed reboot, and the studio is now negotiating with Kristen Wiig, as well as "Saturday Night Live" players Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon, The Hollywood Reporter has learned. Negotiations are ongoing but the quartet are expected to sign on as the specter-seeking, poltergeist-punishing and phantom-phollowing foursome in the reboot, which is eyeing a summer shoot in New York.
McCarthy and Wiig have worked with Feig before, both breaking out with the director's "Bridesmaids" comedy.
Female Ghostbusters? Why Studios Want More Women-Led Blockbusters
Jones, who is currently on screen in Chris Rock's "Top Five," joined SNL early last year and this fall was promoted to feature player status.
McKinnon has been on "SNL" since 2012 and last year was nominated for an Emmy for her work.
The "Ghostbusters" reboot has seen a long development process. Original director Ivan Reitman was on board to return, but while original castmembers Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson had agreed to reprise their characters, Bill Murray proved elusive. Then Reitman bowed out of the project when Ramis passed away last year.
Feig was then approached to direct and reconceived the project as a reboot starring an all-female cast.
Wiig is repped by UTA, Odenkirk Provissiero Entertainment and Jackoway Tyerman.
Jones is repped by APA and Integral Entertaiment while McKinnon is repped by UTA and Principate-Young Entertainment.
Feig confirmed the information in a tweet showing images of the four women.
