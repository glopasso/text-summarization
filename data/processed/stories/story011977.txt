(EW.com ) -- Ryan Murphy has added another attraction to his "American Horror Story: Freak Show"â€”and this one is a real show stopper.
EW: 'American Horror Story' at Comic-Con - 'Freak Show' cast announced
Veteran singer Patti LaBelle will appear in four episodes of the FX anthology series from co-creators Murphy and Brad Falchuk. LaBelle will play the mother of Gabourey Sidibe's character, a townie in 1952 Jupiter, Florida who discover the secrets of Twisty the clown killer. Sadly, the Grammy-winner's part will only require her to act; no singing will be involved.
EW: 'American Horror Story: Freak Show' to be less campy than 'Coven,' FX chief says
LaBelle, most recently seen on Broadway in "After Midnight," joins returning "AHS" cast members Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett, Frances Conroy, Sarah Paulson, Gabourey Sidibe and Evan Peters in the fourth season of the FX hit, which will premiere in October. Michael Chiklis, Wes Bentley, John Carroll Lynch and Finn Wittrock will also join Murphy and Falchuk's parade of oddities this season, which will focus on the last American freak show in the 1950s.
