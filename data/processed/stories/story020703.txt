The number of people who have driven drunk or drugged is down, a new government survey said Thursday.
Still, in an average year, 30 million people drive drunk, according to the survey released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
In addition, 10 million people drive after under the influence of drugs, said the agency, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services,
"13.2 percent of all persons 16 or older drove under the influence of alcohol and 4.3 percent of this age group drove under the influence of illicit drugs in the past year," it said.
Both figures are a drop from recent years.
In the time period of 2002 to 2005, the rate of people driving drunk was 14.6%. Those driving drugged was 4.8% during the same period, the agency said.
The survey also provides a state-by-state tally of drunk and drugged driving.
Wisconsin topped the list of drunk driving at 23.7%. North Dakota was second with 22.4%, the agency said.
The highest rate for drugged driving was in Rhode Island at 7.8% and Vermont at 6.6%.
Utah and Mississippi had the lowest rate of drunk driving.
Iowa and New Jersey had the lowest rate of drugged driving, the agency found.
The agency surveyed more than 400,000 people to get its results.
