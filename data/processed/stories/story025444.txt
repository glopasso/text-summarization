Former Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda suffered a mild heart attack Monday while in New York, the Los Angeles team confirmed Tuesday.
Lasorda, 84, was in New York for the 2012 Major League Baseball First-Year Player Draft. He was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, and doctors inserted a stent to correct a blocked artery, the Dodgers said in a statement. He is resting and in stable condition.
The Hall of Fame manager led the Dodgers between 1976-1996. He also managed the United States to its first gold medal in baseball at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, according to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
"The doctors confirmed I do bleed Dodger blue," Lasorda said in the team statement. "I'm looking forward to being back at the stadium to cheer on the Dodgers."
