Superstorm Sandy left the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island national monuments with enough infrastructure damage to keep them closed, the National Park Service said Wednesday.
Both locations have been closed since October 29, when a rare mix of converging, destructive weather made landfall in the Northeast.
At Liberty Island in New York Harbor, both the visitor and National Park Service docks sustained significant damage, the agency said.
On Ellis Island in Upper New York Bay, water filled the basement of the Immigration Building, while there was also significant damage to mechanical systems and the building's fire suppression system.
It is not clear when both locations will reopen.
