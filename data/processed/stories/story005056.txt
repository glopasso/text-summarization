MADRID, Spain  -- Sevilla midfielder Antonio Puerta has died after collapsing during a Primera Liga match on Saturday, Spanish media reported on Tuesday.
Sevilla midfielder Puerta was able to walk from the pitch but collapsed again in the dressing room. He died on Tuesday.
The 22-year-old Spanish international collapsed after jogging back towards his own goal 35 minutes into the Primera Liga match against Getafe.
Team-mates and medical staff rushed to his side and were seen preventing him from swallowing his tongue as he lost consciousness.
He was able to walk from the pitch but doctors said that he collapsed again in the changing rooms and had to be given cardiac resuscitation before being taken to hospital where he remained on a life support system.
Earlier on Tuesday, a statement from Seville's Virgen del Rocio hospital had indicated that Puerta's condition was worsening.
Puerta is the third high-profile footballer to die after collapsing on the field in recent years.
In January 2004 Benfica's Hungarian international striker Miklos Feher died during a Portuguese league match from a heart attack just seven months after Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed and died while playing in the Confederations Cup tournament in France.
His Sevilla squad are due to play a Champions League qualifer against AEK Athens in Greece later on Tuesday. E-mail to a friend
