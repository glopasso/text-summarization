If ever there were a person born to be a champion of the environment, it's Alexandra Cousteau. Her father is the enigmatic environmentalist Philippe Cousteau and her grandfather is legendary French explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
Alexandra Cousteau established Blue Legacy to educate and encourage people to conserve the earth's water.
Today, Alexandra continues the legacy of her late father and grandfather as she advocates for the protection of our blue planet. With an innate appreciation of the water, Alexandra is committed to telling the stories of the sea in an effort to inspire people to take meaningful action on critical water issues. Through her Blue Legacy organization, Alexandra is helping to shape society's dialogue on water, one of the primary vehicles through which climate change will be felt.
When asked about the impact that her father and grandfather have had on her life, Alexandra explains, "the best example they gave me was the importance of living a life of consequence, value, and meaning. I honor their memories by creating a legacy of my own in speaking out for the preservation of our blue planet and all its waters."
