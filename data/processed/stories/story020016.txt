(EW.com) -- "The Office" ends its nine-season run this month, and rumors have been swirling with respect to how the stories will wrap up and who will return to say goodbye.
At the forefront of the rumors is former "Office" star Steve Carell, who led the Dunder Mifflin crew as General Manager Michael Scott for seven seasons. His particular delivery of Scott's insensitive and naive dialogue drew many viewers to the show, and fans are desperate for news of his return.

Predictions Monday by TV Line have narrowed a Carell appearance to a cameo, having confirmed by unnamed sources that Michael Scott will indeed return for a final farewell moment.
Last week on "Late Show With David Letterman," Mindy Kaling claimed not to remember if Carell would be in the finale or not. When pressed, she said she had signed a nondisclosure agreement and didn't want to lie to Letterman.

In a conference call with reporters last week, show creator Greg Daniels danced around the query, saying, "I think Steve felt, and I agree, that the 'Goodbye, Michael' episode was his goodbye and he didn't want to overshadow the ending that all the other characters deserved."
Daniels didn't specifically say that an appearance by the former boss was out of the question, only that he left on a good note.
NBC has not yet returned EW's request for comment.
