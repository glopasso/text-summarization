South Korea will open its roads for bicycle enthusiasts as the World Bike Festival starts in Changwon Friday.
The four-day festival is part of EcoMobility Changwon 2011, a larger assembly of business leaders; academics and international organizations who will come together to discuss how cities can reduce their carbon footprint in the future.
The festival will highlight the city of Changwon, a self-professed "environmental capital" and give a special focus to its bicycle sharing system called "Nearby Useful Bike, Interesting Joyful Attraction," or "NUBIJA."
The event aims to raise awareness of environmental issues and show visitors that cycling is good for the environment and enjoyable at the same time. Organizers hope to engage with visitors on ways of improving existing environmental protection activities that are in place around the globe. Keen cyclists will also be able to participate in a variety of events including a parade, fashion show, karaoke sessions and two 60-kilometer races.
