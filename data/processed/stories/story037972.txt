Tiger Wood missed the cut at Quail Hollow in his first tournament since a disappointing showing at the U.S. Masters.
A second round one-over 73 Friday left him level par 144 for the PGA Tour event, one outside the cut line.
The former world number one was left to rue a routine four-foot birdie putt on his penultimate hole and he took 33 putts in total in a disappointing showing on the greens.
Woods happier with swing ahead of return
It was only the eighth time in 267 starts as a professional that Woods will have failed to qualify for the final two rounds.
"This is one of my favorite tour stops, and unfortunately, I'm just not going to be around for the last two days," he told gathered reporters after his round.
Coming off a 40th place finish at Augusta after going into the first major of the season as favorite, Woods was also wayward off the tee.
One drive on the par-5 fifth hole could not be found but Woods received a free drop after a ruling.
