(EW.com) -- Chris Pratt's career is about to soar out of this world â€” or, more accurately, out of this galaxy.
EW has confirmed that the "Parks and Recreation" funnyman will play the lead character in Marvel's upcoming "Guardians of the Galaxy," a key part of Marvel's Phase Two plan. Deadline first reported the news.

Pratt, who recently slimmed down (and bulked up) for his role in "Zero Dark Thirty," will play Star Lord, the half-human, half-alien leader of a bio-engineered team of space-traveling heroes. That team includes a green-skinned warrior, a gun-slinging raccoon, a female alien assassin and a fearsome tree-being.
With director James Gunn, the man behind the shlocky masterpiece that is "Slither," and newly-crowned leading man Pratt, is there a chance that "Guardians of the Galaxy" will be an outright superhero comedy?

The source material certainly suggests that the film could work as a totally ridiculous adventure, but we'll obviously have to wait and see what tone the filmmakers choose.
