This is the tale of Peter Rabbit, but not the classic version that Beatrix Potter created.
Instead, this particular Peter Rabbit is one of 65 tattered, matted but, most importantly, cherished stuffed toys and teddy bears that photographer Mark Nixon features in "Much Loved" (Abrams Image), a book that comes out October 29.
Nixon said the inspiration for the photo series came from his son, Calum, who was very attached to the plush rabbit since birth.
When the Dublin, Ireland-based photographer put out the initial inquiry for "loved to bits" teddies, he said he expected most of the submissions to come from children, but adults soon wanted to take part as well.
"It was as though they had been keeping a long-held secret and could finally tell someone what their teddies really meant to them," he writes in the book's foreword.
While many of the bears are eerily dismembered, Nixon said that wornness is the ultimate indication of a teddy "much loved."
