Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has decreed February 6 as "Bob Marley Day."
The proclamation, issued Thursday, includes the following text:
"WHEREAS each year on February 6, we honour the legacy of Robert (Bob) Nesta Marley, an influential musician, advocate for human rights and international ambassador of peace.
Bob Marley became one of the greatest ambassadors of peace the world has seen. He used music to tear down the walls of apartheid and promoted African unity, culture and world peace both at home and internationally, with songs like One Love and Africa Unite. Today, his music continues to be loved by many and is instantly recognized around the world.
NOW THEREFORE, I, Mayor Rob Ford, on behalf of Toronto City Council, do hereby proclaim February 6, 2014 as 'Bob Marley Day' in the City of Toronto."
Ford, who has admitted to smoking crack, was once captured on video dancing during a city council meeting to Marley's music.
He was also recently captured on video speaking in a Jamaican accent, although he never made any mention of Marley.
