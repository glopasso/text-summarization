In an online confession to fans, reality TV celebrity Kim Kardashian on Tuesday addressed the public reaction to her pending divorce.
The divorce paperwork was filed Monday, 72 days after her "Fairytale Wedding" to NBA player Kris Humphries, which was documented for an E! television special.
"First and foremost, I married for love. I can't believe I even have to defend this," she blogged on her website.
In the posting, Kardashian talked about the pressures of reality television, saying she had a difficult time making the decision to film her wedding.
"I got caught up with the hoopla and the filming of the TV show that when I probably should have ended my relationship, I didn't know how to and didn't want to disappoint a lot of people," the post said.
Though Kardashian says she accepts full responsibility for her actions, many have tried her in the court of public opinion. Blogs and social media posts have called for a boycott of shows featuring Kardashian and her family.
The Kardashian family brand was built on openness, she wrote in her note.
"These were all real moments. That's what makes us who we are," she wrote. "We share, we give, we love and we are open!"
