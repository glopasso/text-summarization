Israeli Attorney General Yehuda Weinstein announced Wednesday he intends to indict Foreign Minister Avigdor Liberman on charges of fraud, money laundering, breach of trust and obstruction of justice.
Weinstein decided not to charge Liberman with bribery as police recommended due to lack of evidence, he said.
A final decision on whether to indict Liberman is pending on a formal judicial hearing.
Liberman is suspected of illicitly obtaining about $3 million through a number of shell companies. The alleged crimes date back to before Liberman became foreign minister in 2009.
"I have always operated according to the law and I have no reason to worry," Liberman said Wednesday in reaction to Weinstein's announcement. "After 15 years I will finally have the chance to prove that I have always acted according to the law," he said.
Liberman received the news of Weinstein's decision while attending a conference for his party, Yisrael Beiteinu, in Jerusalem.
He is not expected to resign from his position before a final decision is made.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office released a statement saying Netanyahu "hopes Liberman will prove his innocence." Liberman "is a central member of the government" and Netanyahu "hopes that he will continue his contribution to the public," the statement said.
