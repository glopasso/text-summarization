A 12-year-old girl died Tuesday after falling into floodwaters near Flagstaff, Arizona, authorities said.
Shaelyn Wilson had gone to see runoff from a flash flood around 2 p.m., according to the Coconino Sheriff's Department. A younger sister ran back to tell the father that Shaelyn had fallen into a wash.
The family searched the area near where the girl fell and several agencies also took part in the search, according to Kelli Most, administrative specialist with the sheriff's department.
The girl was found about a third of a mile from where she went into the water, and her father performed CPR until paramedics arrived. She was pronounced dead at Flagstaff Medical Center.
A massive wildfire last month made the area susceptible to flooding, said Most. "There's just no greenery there" to prevent runoff, she said. The blaze charred 15,000 acres.
Several small streams pushed over their banks, and flash floods were threatening homes, according to CNN affiliate KPHO.
