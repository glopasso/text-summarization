Heading to Disney's Magic Kingdom Park for your next vacation?
It'll cost you.
The most expensive theme park at Walt Disney World Resort just got a little pricier. Starting February 23, visitors ages 10 and up will pay $99 for one-day tickets to the Magic Kingdom, a $4 increase.
Prices for one-day tickets at Epcot, Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios also increased $4, from $90 to $94. Many visitors to the Disney parks purchase multi-day passes, which can decrease the daily cost of visiting the parks.
To Disney or not to Disney?
"Our pricing reflects the high quality and breadth of experiences we offer and our ongoing commitment to investing in our parks," said Kim Prunty, Walt Disney World spokeswoman, via e-mail. "We offer a variety of ticket options that provide a great value, and find that most guests select multi-day tickets that offer additional savings."
The Walt Disney Co. reported company revenues of $12.3 billion for the quarter ending December 28, 2013, a 9% increase from the same quarter in 2012. Of that $12.3 billion in revenues, $3.6 billion came from its parks and resorts. Parks and resorts revenues saw a 6% increase from the same quarter in 2012.
"Prices were raised less than a year ago, but for WDW (Walt Disney Resort) it's all about supply and demand," writes Deb Wills, editor-in-chief of AllEars.net, an unofficial Disney planning and fan site. "Attendance is going up, not down; so as long as people keep paying the prices, Disney (any business) will keep raising them."
CNN first learned of the price increase from a Tampa Bay Times Tweet.
