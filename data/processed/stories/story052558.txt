(CNN)Katherine Patrick was 14 years old when Massachusetts legalized same-sex marriage.
Now 25, the "first daughter" of the first state to legalize same-sex marriage is engaged to be married, her father, Gov. Deval Patrick, has announced.
"The Governor and Mrs. Patrick joyfully announce the engagement of their daughter Katherine Wintersmith Patrick to Alisha Marie Lemieux of New Bedford," read a statement released by the outgoing governor's office.
Patrick, a doctoral student studying psychology, and Lemieux, a 21-year-old undergraduate, live in the San Francisco Bay area.
Patrick, who was elected three years after the state's landmark ruling, said he's considering running for president one day.
His two-term tenure as governor comes to an end Thursday with the inauguration of Republican Charlie Baker.
