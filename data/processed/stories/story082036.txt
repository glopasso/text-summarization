James Cameron has one word to describe the "Avatar" sequels: "Bitchin'."
In fact, he has more words than that -- but they're unprintable on a family website.
Cameron is currently in New Zealand working on the scripts for the forthcoming films, he told Empire magazine. The movies have been planned out in detail, he said, and now the writers -- including Josh Friedman, Rick Jaffa, Shane Salerno and Amanda Silver -- are putting words to action.
"I think we met for seven months and we whiteboarded out every scene in every film together," Cameron said. "I didn't assign each writer (the) film they were going to work on until the last day. I knew if I assigned them their scripts ahead of time, they'd tune out every time we were talking about the other movie."
"Avatar," which was released in 2009, is the top-grossing film of all time. The film earned almost $2.8 billion worldwide, including $761 million in the United States. It's also spawned a Disney theme park.
Cameron also directed the second-highest grossing movie, "Titanic," which earned an Oscar for best picture.
The "Avatar" sequels are due beginning in 2016.
