A man accused of crimes against humanity who has evaded International Criminal Court warrants for seven years has surrendered to the U.S. Embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, officials said Monday.
"I can confirm that this morning Bosco Ntaganda ... walked into U.S. Embassy Kigali. He specifically asked to be transferred to the ICC in The Hague. We're currently consulting with a number of governments, including the Rwandan government, in order to facilitate his request," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters.
She said she didn't think U.S. authorities had any advance notice that he would surrender.
News of Ntaganda turning himself in was also reported in a Twitter post from Rwandan Minister of Foreign Affairs Louise Mushikiwabo.
The ICC first issued an arrest warrant for Ntaganda, who at different times has been a Congolese rebel leader and a general in the army of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 2006. That warrant alleged that Ntaganda had forced children to become soldiers in the DRC.
A second ICC warrant issued in July 2012 accused Ntaganda of murder, rape, attacks on civilians and slavery.
