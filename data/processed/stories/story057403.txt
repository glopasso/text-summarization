A search is under way in Kansas for an 18-month-old girl whose mother was found dead along with two others this week.
Three homicide victims were found at a farm in Ottawa, Kansas, on Monday, but they were not identified until Wednesday.
The Franklin County Sheriff's Office confirmed that one of the victims, 21-year-old Kaylie Bailey, had been reported missing last week along with her daughter, whose whereabouts remain unknown.
Bailey, and her daughter, Lana, were last seen on April 28 at the farm, Richards said. The Kansas Bureau of Investigation released conflicting information, saying the mother and daughter were last seen on May 1 on the way to the farm.
The pair was reported missing on May 3 by family members.
"Our priority is finding Lana," Sheriff Jeff Richards said Wednesday.
The toddler has light brown hair and blue eyes, officials said. She is 2 feet tall and weighs about 30 pounds.
Days after the bodies were found and the girl reported missing, police have made no arrests.
Investigators have multiple leads, the sheriff said, adding that deputies have interviewed a person of interest.
"We have three homicide victims that need justice and so do their families, and so we are going to continue to process through this investigation; we are going to continue to follow up on leads," Richards said.
Investigators recovered Bailey's car in Emporia, more than 50 miles west of where the bodies were found.
The other two homicide victims were identified as Andrew Stout, 30, and Steven White, 31.
Bailey and Stout were friends and worked together as security guards, CNN affiliate KSHB reported. Stout and White lived at the property where their bodies were found.
