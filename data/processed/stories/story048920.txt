A long-time member of the Tennessee Army National Guard was killed in a shooting Wednesday in Tennessee, a spokesman for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation said.
Authorities were questioning a person in connection with the shooting, the bureau's Josh DeVine told reporters gathered at the armory, located between the towns of Linden and Lobelville.
DeVine said the person was not under arrest and wouldn't call him a suspect, but also indicated police are not actively looking for anyone else.
Maj. Gen Max Haston of the Tennessee National Guard said the man killed had served in the Guard for more than 20 years and was a sergeant first class. He ran the day-to-day logistical operations for the unit.
Sheriff Tommy Hickerson said he knew the man who was killed.
"He was a good friend of mine and we're not going to stop until we find out who did this," the sheriff said.
It was not know if the victim and his assailant knew each other, officials said. Neither the victim nor the man being questioned were identified by name.
DeVine said the incident happened inside a building and the gunman fired several times, striking the victim at least once.
The armory is about 75 miles southwest of Nashville.
