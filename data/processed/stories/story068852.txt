UPS has identified two pilots killed in a plane crash in the United Arab Emirates on Friday.
Capt. Doug Lampe of Louisville, Kentucky, and First Officer Matthew Bell of Sanford, Florida, were en route to Cologne, Germany, when the plane crashed near Dubai International Airport shortly after takeoff.
"This is a terrible tragedy, and all of us at UPS extend our deepest sympathies to the families and friends of both of these crew members," UPS CEO Scott Davis said in a written statement. "Our thoughts and prayers will continue to be with them during this difficult time."
Lampe, 48, had been with UPS since 1995, the company said. Bell, 38, had been with UPS since 2006.
Both crew members flew out of UPS's Anchorage, Alaska pilot base, the company said.

The cause of the crash remains unclear. UPS says the 747-400 aircraft underwent a major inspection in June 2010.
The National Transportation Safety Board is dispatching an aviation investigation team to assist the General Civil Aviation Authority of the United Arab Emirates in the crash investigation, according to the statement. The GCAA will take the lead on the investigation.
