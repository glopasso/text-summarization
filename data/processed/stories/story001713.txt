Sudan qualified for the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations after beating Burkina Faso 2-1 at the Estadio de Bata on Monday, ending a four-decade wait for victory at the tournament.
Two goals in either half from Mudather Eltaib was enough to secure second place in Group B ahead of Angola, who lost 2-0 to Ivory Coast at the Estadio de Malabo.
Eltaib gave Sudan the lead in the 33rd minute when he sidefooted past keeper Daouda Diakite.
It stayed that way until the 80th minute when Eltaib found the target again, capitalizing on a mistake by Diakite before firing home into an empty net.
Burkina Faso skipper Moumouni Dagano managed a consolation goal moments before the end, but it couldn't stop Sudan recording a first win in the competition for 42 years to set up a meeting with Group A winners Zambia on February 4.

Ivory Coast were assured of a place in the final eight of the competition before Monday's matches, while their opponents Angola needed a point to progress.
Despite fielding an under-strength side -- stars Didier Drogba, Yaya Toure, Salomon Kalou all started on the bench -- The Elephants ran out comfortable winners.
Goals from Emmanuel Eboue in the 33rd minute and a Wilfried Bony strike midway through the second half ensured maximum points from the group and confirmed a meeting with co-hosts Equatorial Guinea at the same stadium next Saturday.
