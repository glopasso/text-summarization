Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, detained in Iran since July, has been freed, according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency and The Washington Post.
Salehi was held with her husband, Washington Post Tehran Bureau Chief Jason Rezaian, and he remains behind bars, The Post reported Sunday after speaking with a family member. Salehi was released on bail last week, The Post said.
It's unclear why Salehi and Rezaian were arrested.
Gholam-Hossein Esmaili, the director general of the Tehran Province Justice Department, has been quoted by IRNA as saying that a "Washington Post journalist has been detained for some questions and after technical investigations, the judiciary will provide details on the issue."

He has not specified on what grounds the correspondent, whom he did not name, was being held. Iranian security forces are vigilant about all kinds of enemy activities, Esmaili added, according to IRNA.
This summer, before the couple was arrested, CNN's Anthony Bourdain met them while filming an upcoming episode of his "Parts Unknown" show.
"They were so positive about their country. I think there was just not a hint of anything that could cause anyone in any government to find fault," Bourdain said on "Anderson Cooper 360."
"So it's just beyond me what they could possibly have done to bring this on themselves. As far as I'm concerned, they were fantastic ambassadors for a little-understood country."
Iran releases main seized with reporter
Human rights activists and other journalists have demanded the release of the couple.
Iran has ranked among the world's top three worst jailers of media workers every year since 2009, according to independent nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists.
