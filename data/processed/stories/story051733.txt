A Lionel Messi brace helped Barcelona to a 5-1 win over Athletic Bilbao and a new La Liga record on Saturday.
With 13 wins and one draw so far, Tito Vilanova's side surpass the previous record for the best start to a season set by Real Madrid back in 1991-92.
Gerard Pique put the home side ahead in the 22nd minute with Messi doubling the lead three minutes later.
Adriano all but sealed the points with a goal at the end of the first half and Cesc Fabregas made doubly sure 12 minutes after the restart.
Ibai Gomez goal in the 66th minute ensured Bilbao's trip wasn't completely wasted but it was Messi who once again had the final say putting away his second of the match moments later.
The Argentine is now one goal away from equaling German Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year set in 1972.
