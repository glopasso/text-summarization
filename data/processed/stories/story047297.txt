First, Iran said it would produce its own cinematic response to "Argo." Now, Tehran plans to sue Hollywood filmmakers who contribute to the production of such "anti-Iran" propaganda films.
State-run Press TV reports that Iranian officials have talked to an "internationally-renowned" French lawyer about filing such a suit.
"I will defend Iran against the films like 'Argo,' which are produced in Hollywood to distort the country's image," said Isabelle Coutant-Peyre.

"Argo," directed by Ben Affleck, who also played the lead role, is about the rescue of U.S. diplomats during the Iran hostage crisis. The film, released in 2012, won the Oscar for best picture garnered Affleck a Golden Globe as director and also took the Golden Globe for best drama movie.
The film claims to be based on a true story rather than to constitute a scrupulous retelling of what took place, and its deviations from reality have been documented.
Iran plans to fund a movie titled "The General Staff," about 20 American hostages who were handed over to the United States by Iranian revolutionaries, according to a report by Mehr News, an official Iranian agency.
Press TV has detailed its objections to "Argo."
"The Iranophobic American movie attempts to describe Iranians as overemotional, irrational, insane and diabolical while at the same, the CIA agents are represented as heroically patriotic," it complained.
