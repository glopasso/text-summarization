Ski star Lindsey Vonn is set for a long spell on the sidelines, but the American should be back on the slopes in time to compete at the 2015 World Championships.
Last week it was confirmed Vonn, the reigning Olympic and World Cup downhill champion, would miss the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi after failing to make a full recovery from a knee injury first sustained in February 2013.
She re-injured the same knee in Val d'Isere, France in December.
Vonn underwent surgery on ligaments in her right knee on Wednesday, with doctors confident that she will be fit to compete in Vail, Colorado.
"Lindsey Vonn underwent successful ACL reconstruction surgery yesterday," read a statement from Vonn's publicist.
"Dr. Jim Andrews performed the procedure and expects her to make a full recovery in time for next year's World Championships in Vail, Colorado."
Dr. Andrews has an impressive sporting pedigree, having previously worked with American football stars Tom Brady and Brett Favre.
He also consulted with Albert Pujols of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim when he underwent shoulder surgery.
Vonn posted a picture of her with her dog Leo on her official Facebook page on Wednesday, confirming that surgery had gone well.
"Surgery was successful!" said the 29-year-old. "Resting with loved ones and of course my cuddle buddy Leo.
"So thankful to have such great people helping me. Will update more later."
Although she won't be at Russia's first Winter Olympics, Vonn -- who is dating golf's world No. 1 Tiger Woods -- will be watching on TV and cheering on her compatriots.
"On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold," said Vonn after it was confirmed she will miss the Games.
"Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially Team USA!"
