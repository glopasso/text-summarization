Better call Saul?
A man who won a contest to meet the cast of "Breaking Bad" back in September has been arrested on drug charges, CNN affiliate WBBH reported.
Ryan Lee Carroll, 28, was arrested Tuesday following a raid on a home in the San Carlos Park neighborhood in Fort Myers, Florida, the station reported.
Carroll, who was reportedly taken into custody on felony charges of alleged possession of synthetic narcotics and a misdemeanor charge of allegedly keeping a shop or vehicle for dangerous drugs, won a national contest to meet the "Breaking Bad" actors prior to that hit show's series finale.
The TV series centers on a science teacher turned meth dealer. Another character on the show, Saul Goodman, is a slick lawyer who employs questionable methods to help his clients.
"It's just so addicting," Carroll told WBBH of "Breaking Bad" at the time he won the contest. "It's such a good show. I think it's addicting because people can relate to the main character."
After the warrant was served on the home, neighbors told the station that the scene was like something out of a Hollywood production, with a swarm of police cars and dozens of officers descending on the neighborhood.
According to the Lee County Sheriff's Office's website, as of Thursday morning Carroll remained in custody.
