Given their woeful defending of late you'd think Manchester United fans would want a decent center back to come to the club not another star forward -- albeit one of the world's best.
After flying a banner of protest against the reign of former manager David Moyes last March, United fans have been at it again -- this time begging Cristiano Ronaldo to return to Old Trafford.
During the first half of Real Madrid's league match at Villarreal on Saturday, a Manchester United supporters club flew a banner over the Estadio El Madrigal reading: "Come Home Ronaldo."
The stunt, organized by a supporters group calling themselves "United Real," adds to growing speculation about the future of the Portuguese who turns 30 next February.
But Ronaldo was quick to dismiss rumors of a move.
"It's all speculation, speaking about my future," Ronaldo told Sky Sports. "My future is Madrid. I'm happy. The season is going well and I'm not talking about my future, it doesn't make sense."
Ronaldo spent six seasons at United from 2003-2009 before moving to Los Blancos for a then world record fee of Â£80 million ($130 million).
Back down on the pitch, Ronaldo scored in a 2-0 win over Villarreal as Real Madrid carried on their recent good form in the league while in Manchester, United bounced back from their calamitous 5-3 defeat to Leicester last weekend with a 2-1 win against West Ham United.
