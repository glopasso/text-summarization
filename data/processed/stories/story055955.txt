(CNN)At least three people were shot Saturday evening at a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-area mall, said a spokesman for the hospital treating the victims.
Jesse Miller of Forbes Hospital in Monroeville told CNN that the emergency department received the three victims from Monroeville Mall at about 8:15 p.m. ET.  He said one of the patients was in stable condition but "the other two, I can't comment on," he said.
Miller told CNN that the hospital's emergency department is in lockdown because a suspect had not been apprehended.
Witnesses at the mall, some 10 miles east of downtown Pittsburgh, described a chaotic scene.
"We were in Dick's (Sporting Goods) and all of sudden a whole bunch of people started running,"  Madison Strohl told CNN. "There were five shots fired right outside of the Macy's inside the mall ... it was really scary."
A woman who picked up the phone at the Macy's refused comment, telling CNN to reach out to the corporate office before she hung up.
