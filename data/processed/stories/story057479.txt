A British Airways plane was damaged while taxiing at a South African airport Sunday, the company said.
"The 182 customers disembarked safely and there were no reported injuries onboard the aircraft," spokesman Philip Allport said in a statement.
The statement did not detail how the Boeing 747 was damaged in Johannesburg, but photos on social media sites show the right wing of a plane apparently collided into a brick building.
British Airways said it has launched an investigation and is assisting the independent South African Civil Aviation Authority on the case.
