"Girls" actress Allison Williams is headed for Neverland.
NBC has announced that the 26-year-old will portray Peter Pan in the network's upcoming musical, "Peter Pan Live!"
"I have wanted to play Peter Pan since I was about three years old, so this is a dream come true," Williams said in a statement. "It's such an honor to be a part of this adventure, and I'm very excited to get to work with this extraordinarily talented team. And besides, what could go wrong in a live televised production with simultaneous flying, sword fighting and singing?"
That sense of humor will likely be welcomed when "Peter Pan Live!" bows in December. Last year, the network tested the live musical waters with "The Sound of Music," and the production and its star Carrie Underwood were both raked over Twitter's coals. The ratings, on the other hand, were impressive enough to encourage the network to give the live musical treatment another go.
Based on the 1954 Broadway musical, "Peter Pan Live!" will be executive produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. Both producers have called Williams, the daughter of "NBC Nightly News" anchor Brian Williams and a classically trained singer, "a major find."
"She will reinvent the iconic role of Peter Pan with her wit, her warmth, her dynamic flying and her wonderful musical abilities," the producers assured potential viewers in a statement.
Starring alongside Williams will be Christopher Walken, who's been cast as Captain Hook. "Peter Pan Live!" airs on NBC on December 4.
