Nevada sheriff's deputies descended Thursday on Wayne Newton's 38-acre ranch with movers in tow to carry out a debt-collection action, but were rebuffed, officials told CNN.
The deputies from the department's civil process service were turned away from the property and returned to the Clark County Courthouse in Las Vegas.
The entertainer known as "Mr. Las Vegas" was facing debt collection of more than $455,000 from a breached contract with a man identified in court documents as Monty Ward.
Thursday's action by the deputies was Ward's attempt to use the legal options available to him to collect on the judgment, an attorney connected to the case told CNN.
The judgment is dated January 27.
Because Ward had not been paid, he was taking other steps to collect, the attorney said.
Ward's is not the only civil action related to finances that Newton faces.
Bruton Smith sued Newton this year in an attempt to get repayment on a $3.35 million loan. Newton's home, which he had put up as collateral, could be at risk, court records show.
CNN's Brittany Kaplan, Karan Olson and Tom Laabs contributed to this report.
