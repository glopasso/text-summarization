Burglars broke into a Southern California home that appears to be that of pop music star Miley Cyrus, police said Saturday.
The burglary was reported around 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) Friday at a residence in Studio City, according to Los Angeles police Officer Rosario Herrera. The homeowner told investigators that some personal items were taken.
Authorities found no evidence of a forced entry, nor were any suspects seen at the property, Herrera said.
Police declined to name the homeowner. But they did provide an address of a residence that is known to journalists as belonging to Cyrus. The singer's representatives did not return CNN's call for comment on the incident.
It threatened to put a damper on a big weekend for Cyrus, who celebrated her 21st birthday on Saturday.
