When Lydia Ko swung to victory at the Canadian Women's Open Sunday, she became the youngest-ever winner in LPGA Tour history.
Currently the world's top-ranked female amateur golfer, Ko, 15, also became the tour's fifth-ever amateur champion -- its first since 1969.
The glove she wore during her final round will become part of the World Golf Hall of Fame's collection.
"I was most impressed with just her demeanor," fellow player Stacey Lewis told reporters in quotes carried by LPGA.com. Lewis is ranked second in the Women's World Golf Rankings.
"I mean you would have never known that it was the final round of an LPGA event. She played like she had been there before."
Ko's success followed triumphs earlier this year at the U.S. Women's Amateur in Ohio and the New South Wales open at the Australian LPGA. The latter competition saw her crowned as the youngest-ever winner of a professional golf tour event, although her record was broken in June.
However, she could not claim the US$300,000 first-place check on Sunday. As an amateur, she is not allowed to accept sponsors or prize money, relying on donations instead.
The South-Korean-born New Zealander said she plans to remain an amateur for the time being.
In addition to her blossoming golfing career, she intends to complete high school, and reportedly has her eye on attending Stanford for college.
"I mean this is a great win, but I don't think this will affect me changing my roots to my career," she told reporters.
Next up, Ko will play at the Women's British Open in September.
