(EW.com ) -- Judge Judy Sheindlin's holiday brainstorm turned into a new court show that's already been sold in 75% of the country. While vacationing in Ireland and observing the country's three-judge panels, Sheindlin came up with "Hot Bench" â€” a new daily show from CBS TV Prods. that'll pretty much to the same thing but on TV with judge Patricia DiMango and attorneys Tanya Acker and Larry Bakman.
"When my husband Jerry and I were in Ireland recently, we visited the courts and watched a three judge bench, which I found both fascinating and compelling," Sheindlin said in a statement. "I immediately thought what a terrific and unique idea for a television program that brings the court genre to the next level. We have assembled three individuals with extremely varied backgrounds to serve as the judges. They are smart and talented, with terrific instincts and great chemistry, and are sure to create a 'hot bench.'"
"Hot Bench" will launch in the fall on station groups like Tribune Broadcasting Company, Sinclair Broadcast Group and Cox Media Group, among. It'll air mostly in afternoon time periods.
