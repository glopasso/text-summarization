A roadside blast killed a NATO service member Wednesday in northern Afghanistan, the International Security Assistance Force said.
The international alliance does not provide the nationalities of victims. An alliance statement did not provide an exact location of the improvised explosive device attack.
This year is already the deadliest for coalition and U.S. forces since the battle against the Taliban started some nine years ago.
Last year, 516 coalition troops were killed in Afghanistan. More than 600 have died so far in 2010, according to a CNN tally -- with more than two months left in the year.
The morbid milestone comes as the United States is making a strong effort to fight the Taliban.
U.S. President Barack Obama ordered the deployment of 30,000 extra U.S. forces to Afghanistan this year, increasing the total American troop commitment to almost 100,000. At least 25 other countries pledged an additional 7,000 troops.
The international alliance was formed under a U.N. mandate to bolster a secure environment and support the reconstruction of Afghanistan. NATO took command in 2003.
The force comprises troops from dozens of countries.
