Two young women, both in their teens, were shot in a small south Texas town over the weekend.
The police chief of the town said the incident -- which left one victim dead and the other clinging to life -- did not appear to be a random attack.
"This particular case, it does have some of the earmarks of a targeted attack," Chief Randy Wright of Portland told local station KZTV.
Wright told CNN on Monday night the two friends were "found by two visitors to the park Saturday morning."
Murders are not common in the town of about 16,000, just north of Corpus Christi. The last took place two years ago, Wright said.
In the latest incident, the young women were found in an observation platform of an overlook at a park, the police chief said.
Authorities believe they were shot sometime late Friday night or early Saturday morning.
One of the victims, 19-year-old Mollie Olgin, was pronounced dead after the shooting.
The second, Mary Kristene Chapa, 18, was in serious condition at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the head.
"We have not been able to take a formal statement from Chapa as she is receiving medical care," Wright said.
One of Chapa's former teachers is helping to organize a blood drive on her behalf.
"We are a very close-knit community and when news of the shooting spread through our town, everyone wanted to help," said Mary Lankford, who taught Chapa at Sinton High School.
Witnesses told police they saw a dark-colored vehicle leaving the scene. But beyond that, detectives have little to go on.
The FBI is assisting in the case, according to Shauna Dunlap, special agent and spokeswoman for the FBI in Houston.
"I've been trying to think of anybody I know that would try and hurt them for any reason,"  Samantha Garrett, Olgin's roommate, told KZTV. "And not one person has ever come to mind."
