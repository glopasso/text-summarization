Actress Amanda Bynes "is excited to be home with her family" and plans to start school "at some point," her mother's lawyer told CNN Thursday.
The troubled 27-year-old has been released from an inpatient treatment center more than four months after she was placed under an involuntary psychiatric hold, attorney Tamar Arminak said.
Bynes is at home in the custody of her parents, she said.
"She is undergoing outpatient treatment several times a week," Arminak said. "She is excited to be home with her family during the holidays and especially happy to re-establish a loving relationship with her parents. Although she is focusing on her health at the moment, she is looking forward to attending school at some point and perhaps even studying fashion design."
Her parents said in September that Bynes was "making great strides towards recovery" from mental illness.
Is Amanda Bynes the new Lindsay Lohan?
A Los Angeles judge ruled last month that Bynes is mentally competent to stand trial on a drunken driving charge.
Bynes was initially detained for a mental health evaluation in late July after her involvement in a residential disturbance and was then held in a psychiatric facility.
At the time, the "Easy A" star had several legal troubles, between the alleged DUI and three misdemeanor charges relating to an incident involving a bong allegedly tossed from her Manhattan apartment window in May.
In September, Bynes was moved from UCLA Medical Center to a private facility for "specialized treatment" at the recommendation of "the skilled health care professionals of UCLA," Bynes' parents said in a statement.
