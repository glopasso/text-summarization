(CNN)If Muslims "must be held responsible" for last week's terror attacks in France, as media mogul Rupert Murdoch has said, does that make all Christians responsible for evil perpetuated by a small minority?
The question is floating around social media in response to the News Corp. CEO's comments about Islam's "growing jihadist cancer."
Author J.K. Rowling was among the first high-profile voices to challenge his argument over the weekend. Then, comedian Aziz Ansari joined in with the hashtag #RupertsFault, inviting others to contribute examples of "all the evil s**t" Christians must be responsible for under Murdoch's logic.
He also asked Murdoch to advise on how Muslims like his "60-year-old parents in North Carolina" can help destroy terrorist groups.
Murdoch ignited the controversy on Friday by tweeting, "Maybe most Moslems peaceful, but until they recognize and destroy their growing jihadist cancer they must be held responsible."
He followed it up with, "Big jihadist danger looming everywhere from Philippines to Africa to Europe to US. Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy."
Naturally, not everyone agreed. Rowling kicked things off, and others piled on, following Ansari's examples. If Muslims are to blame for last week's terror attacks, they argued, then Christians must be responsible for the following:
1. The Spanish Inquisition, Christian fundamentalist violence ... and Jim Bakker.
2. The sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic church
3. Christian extremism
4. The Holocaust
5. Anything annoying or inconvenient remotely related to people who identify as Christians
