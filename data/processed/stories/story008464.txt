Andriy Shevchenko's agent admits it is highly unlikely the AC Milan striker will stay at the San Siro beyond the end of the season.
Shevchenko has made just two Serie A appearances in a disappointing season for Milan.
Shevchenko returned to Milan on loan from Chelsea last summer but has disappointed since his move back to Italy.
The Ukraine striker has found himself mainly on the substitutes' bench, making just two league appearances this season, and agent Fabio Parisi believes his client will not be in Italy next season.
"Shevchenko is a player on loan at Milan from Chelsea and I think he will return to London," he told www.Calciomercato.it.
"Frankly, I don't think it's possible that the Rossoneri will decide to keep him. I don't know what kind of rapport he has found with  coach(Carlo) Ancelotti and his team-mates, the only problem is that he is a player on loan and, given how the season has gone, I think Andriy will return to Chelsea.
"It does depend on who will be the coach and what he wants to do -- but I don't think the doors of Italy will re-open for him next season.
"Anyway, Sheva will decide on his own, he's quite calm, he doesn't need anyone's help. However, another country seems to me the more likely option."
Shevchenko admitted at the end of March that he would probably return to London but, after scoring for Ukraine against England and providing a crucial assist against Lecce, the 32-year-old claimed earlier this month that he hoped to still be at the San Siro next season.
