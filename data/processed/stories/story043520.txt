World No. 3 Roger Federer ended a seven-year wait for a second World Tennis Tournament title after beating Juan Martin del Potro in the Dutch city of Rotterdam.
The 16-time grand slam winner made light work of his clash against the Argentinian third seed, winning 6-1 6-4 in just one hour and 26 minutes.
Federer's triumph was his 71st career title and means 2012 becomes the 12th straight year in which he has captured an ATP tour crown.
The Swiss, who also won here in 2005, said in a courtside interview: "It's incredible that it took me seven years to come back and defend my title, I hope the next time is not so long. But if it is, then it means I'll be playing for another seven years."
"This title marks a great start to the season. My team made a lot of sacrifices. It's been an amazing week for us."
Of his opponent, who beat him in the 2009 U.S. Open final, Federer said: "Juan Martin had a great week. He's playing great tennis. I hope to see you at the (November) World Tour Finals."
Federer, who took his record to 9-2 over Del Potro, blew his opponent away in the opening set, racing into a 5-0 lead after only 28 minutes and securing the opener 6-1 shortly after.
Del Potro rallied in the second set, and forced Federer to save a clutch of break points, but the 30-year-old secured the decisive break in the fifth game to seal the match.
It marks a return to form for Federer who came into the tournament on the back of two defeats -- to Rafael Nadal in the semifinals of the Australian Open and American John Isner in the Davis Cup.
In South America, Spain's Nicolas Almagro retained his Brazil Open crown with a 6-3 4-6 6-4 victory over Italy's Filippo Volandri.
The top seed and world no. 11 hit 18 aces as he made it 11 career titles, all of which have come on clay.
