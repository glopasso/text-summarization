Serbia will face France in the final of the Davis Cup after a tense 3-2 semifinal victory over the Czech Republic in front of a passionate home support in Belgrade.
The Czechs led 2-1 after winning Saturday's doubles rubber, meaning the hosts had to claim victory in both reverse singles to secure their first-ever appearance in the final.
World number two Novak Djokovic, who missed Friday's opening singles with a stomach complaint, drew the two nations level at 2-2 when he recovered from the loss of the opening set to defeat Czech No.1 Tomas Berdych 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4.
It completed a miserable weekend for Wimbledon finalist Berdych, who lost both of his singles rubbers.
That result means Janko Tipsarevic had to defeat the previously unbeaten Radek Stepanek to seal Serbia's final place and he did just that, winning 6-0 7-6 6-4 to send the 15,000 home supporters into raptures.
There was less drama in the other semifinal, where France completed their domination over Argentina with a 5-0 whitewash victory in Lyon.
The French led 3-0 going into the final day, meaning nothing rested on the results of the reverse singles rubbers.
However, Gilles Simon's 7-6 6-7 6-3 defeat of Eduardo Schwank meant the whitewash became a possibility -- and it was completed when Arnaud Clement beat Horacio Zeballos 7-5 6-1.
The victory ensures France, who dumped out holders Spain in the previous round, reached their first Davis Cup final since 2002.
