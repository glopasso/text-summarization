Ellen Ferrell thinks that three turns through a body scanner, coupled with comments about her "cute figure," aren't necessary for security at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
Speaking of the Transportation Security Administration officials who examined her before a flight months ago, Terrell told CNN affiliate CBS 11 News, "They wanted a nice good look."
Ferrell's case may be one of many, according to a CBS 11 News review of more than 500 records of TSA complaints. The News 11 team found a pattern of women who believe that there was nothing random about the way they were selected for extra screening.
Their complaints must be striking a chord.
The TSA's chief blogger, known as Blogger Bob, jumped into the debate Wednesday. He says that Ferrell failed to file a complaint with the agency, which would have allowed the TSA to review video of the scene. (Ferrell told the TV station she didn't know she could file a complaint.) Blogger Bob encourages people to file complaints online or to call the agency at 866-289-9673.
Blogger Bob's post comes days after U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, mentioned Ferrell's name at a Sunday press conference. Schumer announced plans to introduce legislation this week to require every airport where TSA operates to have a "TSA Passenger Advocate" who can be summoned to security checkpoints. (Schumer already had planned the legislation in response to allegations of TSA strip searches of an elderly passenger at a New York airport.)
Blogger Bob didn't mention Ferrell by name but issued several rebuttals about her story:
• The TSA does not profile passengers.
• The technology in place at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport "no longer displays a specific image of the person being screened."
• The old technology "looked more like fuzzy photo negatives than the images that some make them out to be."
• Agents do not scan people multiple times.
