Over the past few decades, there has been a shift toward more mountaintop removal coal mining in West Virginia.
Mountaintop mining blasts apart mountains and deposits debris in nearby valleys to reach the rich coal seams buried inside. About 50% of U.S. power comes from burning coal, and about a third of West Virginia's coal is mined this way.
But 57% of respondents to a CNN/ORC International Poll say they oppose mountaintop mining.
Miners and coal companies say mountaintop removal projects provide much-needed jobs. Their opponents say the cost of those jobs -- to the environment and nearby communities -- is just too high. In CNN In America's documentary, "Battle for Blair Mountain: Working in America ," Soledad O'Brien reports on all sides.
For many in West Virginia, it feels like a choice: steady jobs or a healthy environment. What would you choose?
