(Rolling Stone) -- AndrÃ© 3000 is set to star in "All Is by My Side," the long-awaited Jimi Hendrix biopic, according to the Irish Film and Television Network.
IFTN reports that the film is currently in preproduction in Wicklow, Ireland, and that the shoot will last six weeks. Principal photography is expected to start in about three weeks in Dublin and Wicklow.
The film will reportedly explore Hendrix's early career, tracking his times spent in England in 1966 and 1967 crafting what would become his classic debut album, "Are You Experienced." John Ridley, writer of 1999's "Three Kings" and 1997's "U Turn," is set to write and direct.
The Jimi Hendrix biopic project has been rumored for a long time. Last summer, reports surfaced that the Experience Hendrix estate stopped the project from going forward. Reports did not offer an explanation on why the film is now set to shoot.
