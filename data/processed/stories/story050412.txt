Three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Dario Franchitti was released from a Houston hospital on Thursday, days after he was injured in a serious crash.
Thirteen spectators were also hurt during IndyCar's Grand Prix of Houston on Sunday.
Franchitti, who was at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, will travel to Indianapolis, where he will be evaluated and await a second surgery to his right ankle.
"I'm overwhelmed by the outpouring of support and I'm thankful to have such a great family and such wonderful friends and fans. Thanks to everyone at the hospital and the track who took such good care of me during my stay in Houston," Franchitti said in a statement.
The wreck occurred in the last lap of the race, when Japanese driver Takuma Sato bumped Franchitti's car, sending it airborne into the protective fencing. The car spun multiple times against the fence, sending shards of debris flying toward the grandstands and shearing off part of its side.
Franchitti, 40, suffered a concussion in the wreck and fractures to his spine and ankle.
The Scotland native won IndyCar racing's top prize in 2012, 2010 and 2007. He was married to actress Ashley Judd for more than 11 years, but the couple announced in January that they were ending their marriage.
