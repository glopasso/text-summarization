Sierra Leone's incumbent president won re-election and was sworn in for a second term, pledging to boost the economy of the nation scarred by years of civil war.
President Ernest Koroma got nearly 59% of the vote, beating his closest competitor's 37% in an election international observers described as peaceful.
By getting more than 55%, he avoided a second round of voting with the opposition frontrunner.
Following his win, Koroma called for unity as he was sworn in late Friday.
"Let us, as we celebrate, be mindful that the work starts today and every Sierra Leonean from all political parties, regions, ethnic group, age and religion is central to our agenda for prosperity," the president said. "We must therefore embrace each other as we march forward with action, bravery, commitment, discipline, empathy and fortitude."
Koroma, 59, a former insurance executive, assumed office in 2007. Supporters have credited him with improving infrastructure while critics have said he has not addressed rampant corruption.
