Was there any pre-teen who didn't want Winnie's (Danica McKeller) hair, bangs, belts and boyfriend? Whether you lived through that era or just wished you did, the the five-year series nailed '60s/'70s style perfectly, from Winnie's adolescent evolution to Karen's (Olivia D'abo) hippie-chic ways.

The classic crime-fighting trio gets a 2011 revamp—with a modern-day style refresh.

Bewitched (1964-1972)
With the wiggle of her nose, Samantha (Elizabeth Montgomery) could make a closet full of sleeveless shift dresses look like a million bucks. While the costumes husband Darren appeared in (and the antics the family members got them into) were comical and creative, Samantha plethora of pretty day dresses and romantic dressing gowns were a housewife's dream.

Bonus: Jack (Sean Hayes) gave the ever-polished Grace a run for her money in sweater-vests and suits.
Mad Men (2007-2011)
Tailored pencil skirts, divine cocktail dresses and absolutely impeccable hair and makeup are the foundation to the ultimate throwback show. In fact, the styles are so coveted, Mad Men costume designer Janie Bryant created a capsule collection of similar styles for Banana Republic.

Designing Women (1986-1993)
Sugarbaker Designs may have specialized in interiors, but the Southern belles at the helm showed their fashion savvy in vibrant poly-blends and contoured cheeks. While the group's color-bright frocks and high-volume hair may look thoroughly '80s, these ladies were at the forefront of fashion at the time.
The Flintstones (1960-1966)
Anything but the stone ages! Micro-minis, exposed shoulders, and statement necklaces showed off the ladies curves. Paired with architecturally coiffed 'dos and a swipe of red lipstick, Wilma and Betty were perpetually primped and ready to go.
That Girl (1966-1971)
That suit, those gloves, those shoes, that purse. Marlo Thomas played aspiring actress Ann Marie, one of the first portrayals of a career girl (as opposed to a spouse or homemaker), and she had the wardrobe of a wonderfully independent woman. Her rainbow assortment of mod clothes was the perfect complement to her bubbly personality.
