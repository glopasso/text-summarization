Two people were killed and several others injured in a shooting at a barbershop in Detroit on Wednesday, said police spokeswoman Kelly Miner.
It was not immediately clear whether there was one shooter or more, she said. An investigation is under way.
Miner was not aware of any arrests. The shooting took place at a barber shop on the city's east side, she said.
"What happened was somebody at the barber shop heard all this commotion, opened the door. And then shots were fired into the barber shop," Miner told CNN affiliate WXYZ.
Eight people were wounded and were rushed to hospitals, the affiliate reported.
CNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report.
