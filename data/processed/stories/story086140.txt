(The Hollywood Reporter)Add another fan-favorite character to the cast of next year's "X-Men: Apocalypse," with director Bryan Singer announcing via Instagram that Olivia Munn will play the telepathic Psylocke in the follow-up to "X-Men: Days of Future Past."
Singer revealed that the "Newsroom" actress would play Betsy Braddock in the movie (presumably before the confusing and complicated plot twist that saw Psylocke change from a Caucasian former supermodel to a Japanese ninja for no immediately obvious reason).
"Apocalypse" is currently in production for a summer 2016 release.

The comic book's Psylocke was created by Chris Claremont and Herb Trimpe for the British "Captain Britain" series, where she appeared throughout the 1970s and '80s, before joining the X-Men in 1987's "Uncanny X-Men" No. 213. Since that time, she has been a mainstay both of the main team and spin-off series including "Exiles" and "X-Force."
