(CNN)  -- Japan striker Shinji Kagawa will miss the rest of the Bundesliga season after having surgery in the foot injury he picked up in their Asian Cup semifinal victory over South Korea.
In a blow for his club Borussia Dortmund and country, Kagawa has a broken metatarsal, having been substituted in the 87th minute in Tuesday's match which Japan won on penalties.
"It hasn't really sunk in yet, it'll take me some time," Kagawa told AFP.
"Now I need to try and get back to playing as quickly as I can."
"I have already had an injury in the same place in 2009 and that was sorted out in a month, but I haven't felt as bad as now."
Dortmund are 11 points clear in the German title race with Kagawa playing a major role with seven goals in 18 appearances.
Coach Juergen Klopp said they were unlikely to rush into the transfer market to find a replacement for Kagawa, with young German international Mario Gotze set to continue in his place.
He wants Kawaga, who joined in the summer from Japanese club Cerezo Osaka, to make a full recovery rather than rush back to injury.
"We now have the time to find an absolutely perfect solution for Shinji," he told the club's official website.
Japan take on Australia in the final of the Asian Cup in Qatar on Saturday. Australia beat Uzbekistan 6-0 in their semifinal.
