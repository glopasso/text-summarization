If you're going to break hearts, at least be classy about it.
Yes, "Sherlock" star Benedict Cumberbatch is engaged to director and actress Sophie Hunter -- cue the crying emojis from some fans on Twitter -- but the actor revealed the news in a refreshingly humble way.
Instead of releasing a statement through an army of publicists or posting a photo of engagement rings on Instagram, Cumberbatch went old-school and posted an engagement notice in the Wednesday edition of UK paper The Times.
The six-line notice under "forthcoming marriages" is so straightforward, it would be easy to read past it before realizing that it's taking about THE Benedict Cumberbatch: "The engagement is announced between Benedict, son of Wanda and Timothy Cumberbatch of London, and Sophie, daughter of Katharine Hunter of Edinburgh and Charles Hunter of London."
The lack of fanfare isn't unusual for Cumberbatch, 38, and Hunter, 36, as they've kept their romance under the radar. The couple, who met on the set of the 2009 movie "Burlesque Fairytales," weren't seen together publicly until the French Open this year.
Still, the news of a Cumberbatch wedding is a tough pill to swallow for some admirers. As his star rose with roles in "12 Years a Slave" and "Star Trek Into Darkness," the charming actor has become an international heartthrob.
Twitter has (predictably) gone into mourning:
"First George (Clooney). Now Benedict," tweeted one fan. "It's a cruel, cruel world..."
"Best wishes to #BenedictCumberbatch and #SophieHunter. May you live happily ever after," said another. "Now excuse me while I cry a river."
According to the Daily Mail, the couple has yet to set a wedding date.
