The cast of Marvel's "Avengers: Age of Ultron" just keeps getting better.
On Sunday, "Thor" co-star Idris Elba let it slip in an interview with the UK's Telegraph that he and Tom Hiddleston will appear in next May's "Avengers" sequel.
Elba, 42, has played the Asgard guardian Heimdall in both "Thor" and "Thor: The Dark World," while Hiddleston has portrayed Thor's half-brother, Loki.
Elba didn't specify much about his role in "Age of Ultron," but he did mention that the two men will have a scene with Chris Hemsworth's hammer-wielding Thor.
"I'm in Avengers," Elba confirmed while talking about balancing his career as a DJ with his work as an actor. "I'm doing a scene with Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston, and they're like, 'Aren't you (meant to be) in Ibiza?' "
Elba's the first to admit that being a Marvel star isn't easy, something he realized when he was transitioning between his work on the Nelson Mandela biopic "Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom" and on "Thor: The Dark World."
"I'd just done eight months in South Africa. I came to England, and the day I came back, I had to do reshoots on 'Thor 2,' " Elba said. "I was like, 'This is torture, man. I don't want to do this.' My agent said: 'You have to; it's part of the deal.' "
Of course, Elba stuck it out, and now he's the latest star to watch for in "Avengers: Age of Ultron," which is scheduled to open on May 1.
