"Star Wars" fans, take heart -- Disney Channel has got you.
The network premieres the animated series "Star Wars Rebels" on Friday night, before the show moves to its regular time on Mondays beginning October 13.
Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler notes that while some fans have already started complaining about the project being a kid's show, "it's actually very much in line with the tone of the original 'Star Wars' trilogy."
" 'Star Wars Rebels' is set 14 years after 'Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith' and five years before 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope,' " Fowler wrote. "It takes place during an era when the Galactic Empire is securing its grip on the galaxy and hunting down the last of the Jedi Knights while a fledgling rebellion against the Empire is taking form."
There is already plenty of excitement for the upcoming "Episode VII" film, which is due out in late 2015. The Disney company purchased the "Star Wars" franchise from creator George Lucas in 2013. The filmmaker said then that it was "time for me to pass 'Star Wars' on to a new generation of filmmakers."
"I've always believed that 'Star Wars' could live beyond me, and I thought it was important to set up the transition during my lifetime," Lucas said.
"Star Wars Rebels" has already been given the green light for a second season.
