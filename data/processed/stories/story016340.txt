A group of Chilean miners who spent 69 days trapped underground have traveled to Britain as the guests of football team Manchester United.
A collapse at the San Esteban mine in Chile on August 5 left 33 men stranded, but they were rescued amid jubilant scenes as the world's media watched in October.
Twenty-three of those miners are visiting England, having been invited to cities around the world after becoming international celebrities.
They took part in a training session with United manager Alex Ferguson at the club's Carrington headquarters on Monday ahead of watching that night's Premier League visit by title rivals Arsenal.
"It's fantastic that they're coming," the 68-year-old told United's website. "These are people who showed real substance and perseverance to make sure they survived. There are examples in life which you should always take note of.
"I mean, the life of a miner, having to work in the bowels of the earth and not being able to see anything. That's a great sacrifice to earn your living. I'm sure they'll enjoy themselves on their trip."
Former United star Bobby Charlton also met the club's South American guests.
"I can't believe these are the same people the whole world dropped everything for," Charlton said. "You took it in your stride and everyone around the world is very proud of you."
Last month the miners were saluted with a standing ovation at the CNN Heroes event in Los Angeles, California.

In October Manchester United invited them to visit, while Spanish football star David Villa sent two shirts from his club team Barcelona to the families of the men while they were still trapped to show his sympathy.
Former Chile defender Elias Figueroa, who played in three World Cups and collected 47 caps for his country, accompanied the miners on their trip.
