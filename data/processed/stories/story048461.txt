Coastal Carolina University students returned to class Wednesday, a day after someone killed a student at a campus dormitory.
Police still do not have a suspect or even a description of one, said Thom Berry, a spokesman for the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.
"We continue to interview people," he said.
Anthony Darnell Liddell, 19, of Bennettsville, South Carolina, died Tuesday in a shooting at the University Place residence hall.
The school issued a statement Wednesday, mourning Liddell's death.
"We will continue to do all that we can with all the resources necessary to make sure that our students are safe and secure. We only pray that an event like this never happens on our campus or any college campus again," the school said. Counselors and ministers were at the school Wednesday for students, it said.
More than 9,000 students attend Coastal Carolina, which is on 630 acres about 15 miles northwest of Myrtle Beach.
