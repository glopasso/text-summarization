A commercial flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Minneapolis was aborted shortly after takeoff Sunday morning because of an indicator warning that one of the aircraft's engines had been damaged, according to airline officials.
Delta Air Lines Flight 1846 returned to the Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport within minutes of its 7:45 a.m. takeoff without incident or injury to any of its 119 passengers or six crew members, according to an airline spokesman.
All were rescheduled to take another flight to Minnesota later Sunday afternoon, said Delta spokesman Anthony Black.
Black said Delta mechanics confirmed that parts of the twin-engine Boeing 737-800 had been damaged, though the spokesman did not know which ones.
"Incidents like this are extremely rare, but the crew knows the protocol and it's clear the pilot took appropriate action," Black said.
Broward County Aviation Department spokesman Greg Meyer told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV that pieces of what appeared to be parts of the jet's damaged engine were recovered near the airport.
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said an initial inspection of the aircraft revealed a "contained failure."
"Engine turbine blades exited the rear of the engine, they did not penetrate the engine cover," wrote Bergen in an e-mail to CNN. Bergen said the FAA is continuing to investigate the incident.
