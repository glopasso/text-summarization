"Big Bang Theory" fans can breathe a sigh of relief.
According to Deadline, the stars of the hit CBS series have agreed to hefty pay increases for the new season. Quoting unnamed sources, the publication reports that Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki and Kaley Cuoco have secured three-year deals for "$1 million per episode for the 72 episodes the show is slated to produce in Seasons 8-10."
According to reports, the trio will also have an increased stake in the show's backend profits.
It's been said that the trio previously received more than $300,000 per episode.
The Hollywood Reporter confirmed the deal in its story and said co-stars Kunal Nayyar  and Simon Helberg were still in negotiations, but expected to sign a deal soon.
Warner Bros. Television told CNN that "we aren't commenting on the speculation at this time." Earlier, the company confirmed that "ongoing contract negotiations" had caused production on "The Big Bang Theory's" eighth season to be postponed.
Production had been scheduled to begin July 30 and on  Tuesday the company released a statement saying "Production on season 8 of 'The Big Bang Theory' will begin Wednesday, August 6, with contract negotiations now having been concluded."
Warner Bros. is owned by CNN's parent company.
The new deals would put Parsons, Galecki and Cuoco in the same territory as the former cast of "Friends," who also negotiated for pay raises at the height of their show's popularity.
The popular series was renewed in March. Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch, who also appear on the show, are reported to have received raises in September.
