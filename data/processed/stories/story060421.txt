Beyoncé has delivered the ultimate holiday surprise.
Just after midnight on the east coast, the singer suddenly dropped a brand new 14-track self-titled album on iTunes. That's right — without any pre-promotion.
As if this bombshell — which, in her Instagram announcement, she described as a "visual album" — needed anything else, each song also comes with a music video and a download of BEYONCÉ will also score you three additional videos.
Here is the full track list. Notably, there's a duet with husband Jay-Z and a cameo from daughter Blue Ivy:
1. Pretty Hurts
2. Haunted
3. Drunk in Love (feat. Jay Z)
4. Blow
5. No Angel
6. Partition
7. Jealous
8. Rocket
9. Mine (feat. Drake)
10. XO
11. ***Flawless (feat. Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche)
12. Superpower (feat. Frank Ocean)
13. Heaven
14. Blue (feat. Blue Ivy)
