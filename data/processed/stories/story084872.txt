Dozens of people have been killed in Central America as heavy rains continue to hammer the region.
In Guatemala, the death toll has risen to 28 and close to 110,000 people have been affected so far, the state-run AGN news agency reported.
Citing the president, the agency said 15,000 more people are at risk and roughly 12,000 are in shelters.
"We've been able to respond to all the requests for help we've received -- many by land because we haven't been able to fly over the areas," said President Alvaro Colom, AGN reported.
Meanwhile in El Salvador, the government has declared a state of emergency and ordered evacuations in some of the hardest-hit areas.
At least 24 have died in El Salvador, including seven children, according to the country's civil protection director. Some 13,000 people are in shelters.
Central America has been hammered by torrential rain since last week, when Hurricane Jova struck Mexico as a Category 2 storm late Tuesday. It weakened into a tropical storm and then a tropical depression as it moved over western Mexico.
More rain in the region is forecast.
