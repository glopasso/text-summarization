A tornado touched down in central Illinois Saturday, police said, but there were no immediate reports of injuries.
The Peoria County Sheriff's Office said the tornado touched down in Elmwood, Illinois, on Saturday night.
Pictures from CNN-affiliate WMBD showed a twisted gas station awning and streets covered with debris, branches and broken glass.
The tornado ripped through downtown Elmwood and tore the second stories off buildings, WMBD reported. Authorities had closed major roads in the area, WMBD said.
Severe weather was reported across much of central Illinois Saturday night as much of the area remained under a tornado warning, according to the National Weather Service.
