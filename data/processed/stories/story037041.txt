(CNN)A powerful 6.7 earthquake struck off the coast of Japan, the U.S. Geological Survey said on Monday.
The quake's epicenter was 83 kilometers (52 miles) east-northeast of Miyako, Japan, USGS said.
It was 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) deep and occurred at 6:06 a.m. Tuesday in Japan (6:06 p.m. ET Monday).
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no tsunami threat from the quake. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued a tsunami advisory shortly after the quake, warning of strong currents, but later canceled the advisory.
The Tokyo Electric Power Company, whose Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered meltdowns at three reactors after an earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in 2011, said no abnormalities had been reported at its nuclear plants after Tuesday's quake.
CNN's Sarah Aarthun, Nimet Kirac and Bex Wright contributed to this report.
