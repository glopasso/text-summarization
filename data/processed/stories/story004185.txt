Two years after Demi Moore announced she wanted to end her marriage to Ashton Kutcher, their union is legally undone.
Kutcher's lawyer filed the document in Los Angeles County Superior Court Tuesday making their final divorce settlement official, according to a court spokeswoman.
Kutcher, 35, filed the divorce petition last January -- citing irreconcilable differences -- but Moore, 51, made it clear in November 2011 that the marriage was over.
"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton," Moore said in her announcement.
Kutcher has been dating his former "That '70s Show" co-star Mila Kunis since early 2012, although she initially denied a romantic relationship.
He is one of television's best paid performers thanks to the gig he got on CBS' "Two and a Half Men" after Charlie Sheen's implosion.
Moore and Kutcher began dating in 2003 and married in September 2005 despite a 15-year age difference.
In the wake of Moore's announcement of their split two years ago, Kutcher tweeted: "I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and Light, AK"
The separation, however, came amid reports that Kutcher cheated on his wife on the night of their wedding anniversary.
"As a woman, a mother and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life," she said at the time. "This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation."
This is Kutcher's first divorce, but the third time for Moore. She was previously married to actor Bruce Willis and rock musician Freddy Moore.
