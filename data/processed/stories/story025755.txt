As President Barack Obama and former Gov. Mitt Romney crisscrossed the country during the final week of the 2012 presidential campaign, few people were able to see the candidates in their most candid and unguarded moments, except for their personal photographers.
Several weeks ago, CNN invited each campaign team to submit images from the last week of the race, from Friday, Oct. 26 through Saturday, Nov. 3.
Little did anyone know that the last week would be dominated not by last-minute stops in swing states or wall-to-wall speeches to rally the party faithful, but rather one story: Superstorm Sandy.
Here are images, many provided exclusively to CNN by the Obama campaign and The White House, displayed in chronological order and shot by photographer Pete Souza.
Souza, who is Chief Official White House photographer and Director of the White House Photography Office, has been at Obama's side since before he was elected president in 2008 and was a White House photographer during Ronald Reagan's second term.
