Bayern Munich cruised to a 5-0 win at Dusseldorf on Saturday to set a new Bundesliga record for most consecutive wins at the start of the season.
Two goals from Thomas Muller and one each for Croatia's Mario Mandzukic, Brazil's Luiz Gustavo and Rafina ensured Bayern made it eight wins from eight -- one better than the previous record they held jointly with Mainz, who racked up seven straight wins two seasons ago.
Frankfurt continued their chase of the league leaders by beating Hanover 3-1 to register their sixth win of the season.
Goals from Algeria midfielder Karim Matmour and German defender Sebastian Jung put Frankfurt 2-0 up inside the opening 20 minutes before Hanover pulled one back through Mohammed Abdellaoue two minutes before the break.
But an Alexander Meier header eight minutes from the end means Frankfurt are now five points behind Bayern.
Schalke consolidated third place with a 2-1 win at fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund.
A volley from Dutch midfielder Ibrahim Afellay put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute before Marco Hoeger doubled the lead three minutes into the second half.
Polish striker Robert Lewandowski got one back for Jurgen Klopp's side seven minutes later but an equalizer never materialized.
Schalke are now seven points adrift of Bayern while Dortmund now trail the leaders by 12.
In Saturday's other games, Freiburg beat Wolfsburg 2-0 while Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 with Mainz.
