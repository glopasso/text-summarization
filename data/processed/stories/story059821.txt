A Russian spacecraft was launched Sunday in Kazakhstan, carrying crew members from three countries to a four-month deployment aboard the International Space Station.
NASA astronaut Sunita Williams, Japan's Aki Hoshide and Russian cosmonaut Yuri Malenchenko will join other crew members on the station, according to NASA.
The Soyuz TMA-05M was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, according to NASA.
The Soyuz is expected to dock with the orbiting complex on Tuesday, NASA said.
The launch and docking of the Expedition 32 crew members coincides with the 37th anniversary of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first docking of an American spacecraft with a Russian spacecraft.
