A California man indicted in a Vanderbilt University football rape investigation traveled to Tennessee and surrendered to police, Nashville authorities said Friday.
Miles Joseph Finley, 19, who is charged with evidence tampering, will be arraigned later. His bail was set at $10,000, Nashville police said, and it was unclear Friday whether Finley had posted that bail. Neither he nor his attorney could be immediately reached for comment.
A co-defendant, Joseph Dominick Quinzio, 20, of Palm Desert, California, "continues to go through the legalities of the extradition process in California," police said in a statement.
Finley, of Bermuda Dunes, California, and Quinzio are friends of Brandon Vandenburg, one of four former Vanderbilt football players indicted on charges of rape, and are each accused of one felony count of tampering with electronic evidence, authorities said.
Vandenburg is accused of taking an unconscious Vanderbilt woman into a building on campus on June 23. He was allegedly joined in his dorm room by three now-former Vanderbilt football players also indicted on charges of rape: Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie, authorities said.
A fifth football player, Chris Boyd, 21, a standout junior wide receiver, pleaded guilty to helping cover up the alleged on-campus gang rape and was removed from the team. He accepted a yearlong probation sentence and agreed to testify against the four other players.
The four other football players have been dismissed from the team and suspended from school. Each of the four men has been charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography, police said.
