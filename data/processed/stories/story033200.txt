Nearly six years after he escaped from prison, one of the U.S. Marshals Service's 15 Most Wanted fugitives has been extradited from Mexico and returned to that same prison, according to the federal agency.
Convicted child killer Edward Salas was serving time for murder when he escaped from the Curry County Detention Center in Clovis, New Mexico, in 2008.
At the time of his escape, Salas was serving a life sentence plus 56 years for his role in the murder of a 10-year-old boy, the Marshals Service said in a press release issued Saturday.
Mexican authorities arrested Salas in October 2012 on a U.S. provisional arrest request.
The Marshals Service worked closely with the Curry County District Attorney's office, Mexican authorities and the Department of Justice's Office of International Affairs, which resulted in Salas' return to Curry County on Saturday, according to the release.
In 2005 Salas, with two of his brothers and two other people, planned to murder a teen named Ruben Perez in his home, reportedly in retaliation for an argument at Clovis High School. Instead, they killed the teen's brother, Carlos Perez, who was sleeping in the same bedroom.
Carlos Perez died the day before his 11th birthday, the Marshals Service said.
