Short, 31, is accused of punching and knocking out a patron at a West Los Angeles restaurant on March 15, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement.
He was booked by the Claremont Police Department and released on $50,000 bail, the statement said.
A representative for the actor could not be immediately reached for comment.
Short plays Harrison Wright, a member of fixer Olivia Pope's team, on the hit ABC series.
