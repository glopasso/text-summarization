(EW.com) -- Party at Charlie Sheen's house tonight!
The actor's comedy series "Anger Management" was just picked up for a 90-episode renewal, FX announced.
"We set a very high ratings bar that included some additional hurdles for 'Anger Management' to earn its back-90 order and the series met and exceed those metrics," said Chuck Saftler, executive vp of FX. "Bruce Helford has created a sitcom that works extremely well in our pre-10 p.m. programming lineup. Charlie Sheen and the entire cast did an amazing job in the first ten episodes, which were produced in a very tight window. I have no doubt that the producers and cast will be able to pull off the Herculean task of producing 90 episodes over the next two years."

As part of the show's deal, "Anger Management" needed to hit a designated average ratings threshold over the course of its first season. Meeting that number triggered an automatic, additional 90-episode order.
