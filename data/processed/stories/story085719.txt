Daniel Radcliffe has blown the Internet's collective mind, but this time not with his acting.
No, it's his rap skills that took everyone by surprise on Tuesday night's "Tonight Show."
The 25-year-old actor was on the program to promote his new movie "Horns," and talk turned to his love of music. Radcliffe's a known fan of hip-hop and counts Eminem as one of his favorite artists.
"I was the first kid in my class to learn 'The Real Slim Shady,'" Radcliffe told host Jimmy Fallon. "I've always had an obsession with memorizing (lyrically) complicated, intricate and fast songs."
But it wasn't a Slim Shady track that Fallon asked him to perform -- it was Blackalicious' tongue-twisting "Alphabet Aerobics."
When Fallon handed Radcliffe the mic, the actor calmly slipped out of his jacket and began to give a jaw-dropping performance without breaking a sweat or stumbling over a line.
The reaction? Total shock.
"Daniel Radcliffe rapping Blackalicious on @FallonTonight is one of my top five favorite things that have ever happened on this planet," said one viewer. "Alert: Daniel Radcliffe is rapping in an American accent on #FallonTonight and it is AMAZING," tweeted another.
If Radcliffe can write as well as he can rap, he just might have an album in his future.
