Afghan  President Hamid Karzai and Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan, say  they've secured backing from local leaders for an upcoming military operation in  the province.
McChrystal  took Karzai and some of his security chiefs to Kandahar, considered the heartland of Taliban  country.
With  McChrystal in the front row, Karzai delivered a full-court press to a group of  about 300 tribal leaders Sunday, in a bid to get their support.
The group  sat on carpets and cushions on the floor as they listened to Karzai passionately  talk about increasing security and ending corruption.
He also had  a stong message for the Taliban.
"First I  call on the Taliban for peace. Do not kill your country men and children. Do not  kill innocents," Karzai said. "Separate yourself from al Qaeda and the  terrorists."
McChrystal  and Karzai believe they got approval for the coming offensive, which has already  been delayed once.  About a month and a half ago, another military plan  presented to locals by Karzai was rejected.
McCrystal  said securing support from Afghan leaders before the start of a new offensive  was critical to success.  He added that this is a lesson learned from previous  offensives in the country.
Tribal  leaders had mixed reviews for the plan.  Some doubted Karzai's government was  capable of mounting such an offensive.  Others expressed faith in the president,  but objected to the involvement of U.S.  troops.
Karzai did not say when the upcoming  military operation would take place.  But initial reports indicate that Afghan  troops will take the main role in the center of Kandahar, while U.S. troops will be mainly on the  perimeter.
