Shanshan Feng wants to emulate the superstar status enjoyed by fellow Chinese sports star Li Na after becoming the country's first winner of a major golf tournament.
Feng carded a five-under-par 67 to seal a two-shot triumph at the LPGA Championship in New York on Sunday, which also made her the first woman from mainland China to win on the U.S. women's circuit.
Her previous best performance in 16 other major championships was a tie for 22nd at the Kraft Nabisco in April.
Tennis star Li saw her profile increase dramatically after clinching the 2011 French Open title, making her China's first grand slam singles champion, and Feng hopes her win can have a similar impact on golf's popularity in the country.
"Hopefully it's going to help golf in China because I want to be Li Na for golf in China," the 22-year-old told the LPGA's official website.
"I want to be like a model that the other juniors can follow my steps and get on the LPGA.
"It is amazing. I think I'm just lucky. There are good players from China, young players, right now. I became the first one, but I'm sure there will be a second, third, more people winning in the States and winning majors."
Feng, who has risen to fifth in the world rankings following her success, revealed how she focused on improving her short game during the offseason.
"I think I've always been a good ball striker, but my short game is usually a little weak," she said. "So there in the offseason I focused on practicing short game like chipping and putting, and I think it worked."
Feng finished six under for the tournament ahead of a four-way tie for second. Japan's Mika Miyazato, 2011 Kraft Nabisco champion Stacy Lewis, Norway's world No. 4 Suzann Pettersen and 2009 U.S. Open winner Eun-Hee Ji of South Korea were all on four under.
American Paula Creamer tied for ninth on two under, while five-time major winner and world No. 1 Yani Tseng of Taiwan endured an unsuccessful title defense and finished tied for 59th.
