Snoop Dogg quickly settled with Norwegian customs officials who found that he was carrying marijuana as he entered Norway on Thursday, a police spokeswoman said.
The rap star paid a 12,000 kroner fine, nearly $2,000, after he was found with eight grams of pot while going through the customs checkpoint at the Kristiansand Airport in Kjevik, police spokeswoman Vanja Bruvoll said.
He also paid a fine for having more cash than is allowed without it being declared, Bruvoll said.

Snoop Dogg, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, cooperated with police, and the case is considered closed, she said.

Snoop Dogg, who has a license to use medical marijuana in his home state of California, was charged with pot possession after border agents searched his tour bus on a West Texas highway in January.
He "freely admitted" that three prescription bottles filled with marijuana cigarettes were his, a statement from the Hudspeth County, Texas, sheriff said at the time.  He later paid a fine to settle that case, the county prosecutor said Thursday.
