Moussa Dadis Camara, the military leader of the West African nation of Guinea, was shot and wounded in an attack on his presidential convoy, an official said.
His "life is not in any danger," said the regime's minister of state for presidential affairs, Maj. Keletigui Faro. "The situation is under control."
The attack occurred on Thursday in Conakry, the nation's capital, Faro said.
It comes after increased pressure internally and internationally for Camara to hold, but not be a candidate in, elections in January. Camara, who seized power in a coup in December 2008, has given no indication that he will follow through with the elections.
In September an opposition demonstration was marred by violence, as the military fired on people gathered in the capital's national stadium. Human rights groups say at least 157 people were killed and many women were raped.
The military continues to crack down on opposition in the country, Amnesty International said in a newly released report.
"A climate of fear continues in Guinea," said the organization's Gaetan Mootoo. "The authorities can no longer turn a blind eye to the human rights violations committed by its security forces."
