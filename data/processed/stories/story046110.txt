People of the Internet, make yourself comfortable on the couch. Google would like to psychoanalyze you.
OK, not really. But an interactive doodle on Google's search page Friday invited users to take a Rorschach test. Traditionally the test requires a person to look at a series of abstract inkblots and describe what they see. Some mental-health experts believe the answers can reveal personality characteristics and disorders.
The doodle celebrates the 129th birthday of Hermann Rorschach, the Swiss psychoanalyst who developed the famous test. Google's page allowed users to click through a series of inkblot images and share their interpretations of them on social media.
Some ink blotches were abstract, while others clearly depicted things such as cats (this is the Internet, after all).
By mid-morning Friday, feeds on Facebook, Twitter and Google+ were filling with Rorschach answers, or jokes (Rorschach, the spotted-faced character in the Watchmen graphic novel and movie, was a popular one).
Here are a few of our favorites.
