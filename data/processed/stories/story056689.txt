Family members of 19 Chinese tourists, who went missing in Taiwan after Typhoon Megi triggered rock slides, are headed to the island, China's state media said Monday.
The tourists from Zhuhai city in southern China went missing about 10 p.m. Thursday. Two other people -- a Taiwanese bus driver and a Chinese tour group leader from another tour bus -- also are missing, according to official Taiwanese media.
Emergency crews rescued hundreds of other people who were trapped by the rock slides, which happened mainly along the Suhua Highway, in northeast Taiwan. Sections of the scenic highway, which is perched along a cliff on Taiwan's eastern coast, gave way.
Typhoon Megi made landfall in China's southeastern province of Fujian on Saturday, affecting nearly 650,000 people and destroying 500 houses, China's Xinhua news agency said. About 270,000 people had evacuated.
Damage in Fujian from the strongest typhoon of the year was estimated at 1.59 billion yuan ($238 million).
No deaths or significant injuries were reported, thanks to rigorous typhoon precautions in Fujian, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, the state-run China Daily said Monday.
Megi killed at least 13 people and injured nearly 100 others in Taiwan last week. It struck the Philippines earlier in the week, affecting an estimated 258,844 people and leaving thousands homeless.
