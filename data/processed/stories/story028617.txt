The Nevada family that survived two days stranded in subzero temperatures is not expected to face any long-term health problems from the ordeal, their doctor said Wednesday.
The six family members don't even have frostbite, said Dr. Doug Vacek, declaring their condition "absolutely amazing."
Christina McIntee, 25, and the youngest child Chloe, 3, were released from a hospital Wednesday. Their health is "perfect," Vacek said.
James Glanton, 34, and the other three children remain hospitalized so they can receive more IV hydration. But they're "doing really well," Vacek said.
It's unclear how soon they may go home. Lab test results will help make the decision, Vacek said.
The family -- Glanton, McIntee, the two children they share and McIntee's niece and nephew -- went out Sunday together for a playful outing in the snow. The adventure dissolved into a fight for survival after their Jeep Wrangler turned over and slid down an embankment on its top, ending up in a crevice 15 miles from Lovelock.
They were found nearly 48 hours later, at midday Tuesday.
In a statement, the family thanked numerous agencies for "the valiant search and rescue efforts" and requested privacy as it heals and recovers from the ordeal.
The family is "very truly appreciative of the care and love" from the community and the entire country, the statement said.
Patricia Bianchi, CEO of Pershing General Hospital, read the statement to reporters.
The family had taken critical steps to prepare for the trip, including bringing along blankets and food. After the accident, they didn't panic or leave the scene. They heated rocks and placed them in a spare tire to keep the children warm.
And since the vehicle windows did not break, "they were able to get some shelter in there," Vacek said.

In the hospital, the children are playing video games and having visits from family and friends, Vacek said. "Kids are very resilient."
