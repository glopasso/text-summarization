Diego Forlan grabbed two goals as Uruguay thrashed Paraguay 3-0 in Buenos Aires to secure a record 15th Copa America title.
The striker, who plays for Spanish club Atletico Madrid, struck in each half to become Uruguay's joint highest scorer in history after Liverpool forward Luis Suarez had broken the deadlock after only 11 minutes.
It marked Uruguay's first Copa America triumph since 1995 and they can now boast one more title than hosts Argentina, who they beat in the quarterfinal.
In a one-sided final at the Estadio Monumental, Uruguay almost took the lead in the third minute when Diego Lugano's header was blocked on the line by Paraguay keeper Justo Villar.
But just eight minutes later Suarez found the net and notched his fourth goal of the tournament.
Collecting a ball inside the area Suarez brought it down and cut inside on his left to fire a shot into the bottom corner, via a slight deflection off defender Dario Veron.
Suarez put Forlan through on goal just after the half hour mark but Villar made a crucial save to keep the deficit at just one goal.
But he could do nothing four minutes before halftime as Egidio Arevalo Rios robbed Nestor Ortigoza of possession and teed up Forlan who made no mistake with a powerful drive.
Paraguay tried to force the pace in the second half and hit the crossbar after Nelson Valdez's shot was tipped onto the woodwork by Uruguay goalkeeper Nestor Muslera.
But Paraguay's threat faded after that and they were thankful to another fine save from Villar to prevent Sebastian Eguren putting the game beyond doubt.
That feat was left to Forlan who finished a fine breakaway move in the dying seconds as he finished smartly following Suarez's precise header and pulled level with Hector Scarone as Uruguay's all time leading goalscorer on 31.
