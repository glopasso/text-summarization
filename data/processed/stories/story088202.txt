Sherri Shepherd and Jenny McCarthy are weathering changes at "The View" changes with a smile.
The two daytime TV hosts are among those leaving ABC's long-running talk show, which is in the midst of some "abrupt" changes.
Yet on Thursday, Shepherd and McCarthy showed their solidarity on Instagram.
"Mr @DonnieWahlberg always takes care of his ladies @jennyannmccarthy & me!" Shepherd captioned a photo of herself with McCarthy and McCarthy's fiancÃ©, Donnie Wahlberg, all three of them wearing grins. "To be continued," she remarked.
Sources told CNN that producers and people close to Shepherd have been aware for months that she was ready to leave "The View." The sources added that Shepherd opted to keep the news quiet, not wanting to overshadow or disrupt Barbara Walters' departure in May.
"The number 7 is God's number of completion & after 7 seasons my time at The View is now complete! ... Incredibly grateful to my second mom @BarbaraJWalters for pushing me beyond my comfort zone - it's been amazing doing it scared!" Shepherd tweeted Thursday. "Life should be lived. Run towards the things that scare you. Choose joy and trust God - everything else will work out as it should."
"The View" has been in a state of flux for the past year, with longtime personalities Joy Behar and Elisabeth Hasselbeck taping their final shows in mid-2013. Jenny McCarthy was added to the "View" panel last July, but it appears that she, too, is leaving.
"If Sherri goes... I go too. #sisters," McCarthy tweeted Thursday. "My View will be changing too. As will with many hard working folks. Thanks to everyone at the show for your dedication and an amazing year."
While it's unclear what "The View" has in store, the network told CNN in a statement that the series "will be moving in an exciting new direction next season and ABC has made decisions to evolve the show creatively."
CNN's Nischelle Turner and Topher Gauk-Roger contributed to this report.
