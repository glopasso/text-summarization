London fire officials were at the O2 arena Tuesday morning after two tour buses of the Grammy-nominated rock band Kings of Leon caught on fire, the Fire Brigade said.
Kings of Leon was scheduled to play the arena Tuesday night.
"The fire is under control and no injuries reported. Assessments are currently underway and we expect to make a decision in the next couple of hours as to whether tonight's Kings of Leon show will go ahead. We will keep our website updated so please check back throughout the day," the group said on its website.
Sixty firefighters were battling the blaze near a loading bay of the facility, officials said.
"Our crews are doing a fantastic job, especially given the levels of smoke down here which has lead to quite challenging conditions," the Fire Brigade said.
The Kings of Leon has achieved tremendous success in recent years, scoring a multi-platinum album and several hit singles with their 2008 CD "Only by the Night."
They are now touring to promote their fifth album, "Come Around Sundown."
