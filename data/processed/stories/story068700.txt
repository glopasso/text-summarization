Oscar-nominated actor Bob Hoskins announced Wednesday he is retiring from acting following his diagnosis of Parkinson's disease last year.
The 69-year-old British actor, perhaps best known for playing the detective in the 1988 film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," issued the statement through his wife, Linda.
"He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career," it read. "Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time."
Hoskins first gained fame in the 1978 British TV miniseries "Pennies from Heaven," according to IMDb.com. His other notable films include 1986's "Mona Lisa," which brought him an Academy Award best actor nomination, as well as "The Long Good Friday," "Mermaids," "Hook" and "Mrs. Henderson Presents."
He has appeared in at least one production every year since 1972.
He played the elf Muir in this year's "Snow White and the Huntsman."
Parkinson's disease is the same neurological disorder that actor Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with in 1991.
