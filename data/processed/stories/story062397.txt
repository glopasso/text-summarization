NBC's "The Michael J. Fox Show" has been canceled and replaced on Thursdays by "Hollywood Game Night," EW confirmed Wednesday.
NBC yanks 'Sean Saves the World'
The actor, who was on "Family Ties" in the '80s and "Spin City" in the late '90s, hasn't yet made it through one season of his anticipated return to television; 15 of the show's 22 episodes have played so far, and there's no word yet when or if the rest will air.
"Sean Saves the World," which NBC had already announced was canceled, has also been pulled from the Thursday night lineup.
Which NBC shows are in trouble?
At last month's Television Critics Association press tour, "The Michael J. Fox Show" and "Sean Saves the World" were notably absent from NBC's prime-time hype reel. At the time, network chairman Robert Greenblatt said he wasn't happy with "Fox's" recent 0.6 adult demo rating, adding that the show faced an "uphill battle."
