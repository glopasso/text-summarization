The gunman who killed at least two people and then himself in an office building in southern California is a 48-year-old man from the nearby town of Norco, authorities said Saturday.
He was identified as Andre Turner.
Those slain Friday were Henry Serrano, 56, of Walnut, California; and Robert Lindsay, 53, of Chino, California, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said.
The building is occupied by Southern California Edison, one of the nation's largest electric utilities, serving almost 14 million people, according to a company statement.
The victims were employees from Southern California Edison, as was the gunman, the company said in a statement Saturday.
"This is one of the most horrible days in our company's history," Ted Craver, chairman and CEO of Southern California Edison, said in a written statement Friday.
More than 200 employees work in the building, mostly in information technologies, utility spokesman Gil Alexander said.
"This is, of course, first and foremost a tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families affected," Alexander said. "We're all anxious to find out what happened."
Two nearby schools, Walnut Elementary School and Olive Middle School in Irwindale, went into lockdown during the incident, said Laura LaTurno with the Baldwin Park superintendent's office.
