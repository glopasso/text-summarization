The bodies of two people who were aboard a Learjet that crashed shortly after takeoff from a Florida airport were recovered from the Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday night, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said.
Petty Officer Mark Barney said the bodies of a man and woman were located just off the coast of Fort Lauderdale.
A spokesman for Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport said a medical flight had dropped off a patient and was returning to Mexico. There were four people -- two pilots, a doctor and a nurse -- aboard, Greg Meyer said.
Authorities were still searching for the other two people on board.
The Learjet 35, which can carry up to eight passengers, was headed to Cozumel, Mexico, officials said.
In an audio recording of air traffic control, the pilot asks to turn around before saying, "Mayday, mayday, mayday."
The cause of the crash was not clear. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating.
