(EW.com) -- Justin Timberlake hasn't released an album since 2006â€²s "FutureSex/LoveSounds," mostly because he has been distracted by the business of being Justin Timberlake.
That tends to fill one's day with acting in Oscar-winning films, dropping into the occasional SNL sketch, hosting a golf tournament, sometimes going to the Marine Corps Ball and being engaged to Jessica Biel.
It's a busy life, which is why our eyebrows raised when we saw these quotes from a producer named Jim Beanz, who claims to be working with Timberlake on a series of songs for a "crazy" new album. Considering JT's stature and the types of people he has worked with in the past, why would he hook up with a dude nobody has ever heard of?
It turns out... he wouldn't. According to Timberlake's publicist, there are currently no plans for a new album, though JT is working with Timbaland on tracks for "Shock Value 3" (he appeared on each of the first two installments of the series).
But as for other music, "That's it," said the spokesperson.
That makes a lot more sense for Timberlake, who's now pretty much entirely focused on acting. In fact, he's currently in Puerto Rico with Ben Affleck filming the movie "Runner Runner," which would certainly get in the way of his being in the studio.
So while the idea of a new JT album is titillating (especially for those of us still obsessed with "FutureSex"), it will have to remain a fantasy for now.
But it does bring up a good question: What other musicians have walked away on top the way Timberlake did? While he hasn't been completely invisible (he has dropped in on tracks for Madonna, T.I., Jamie Foxx, Timbaland and Esmee Denters, among others, since the release of "FutureSex/LoveSounds"), he has pretty much put the idea of an album on the back burner â€” though he may be dipping his toe into the world of film scores.
