(Rolling Stone) -- While his next official album ripens in the blazing South Florida sunshine, Rick Ross has delivered a delicious appetite-whetter.
"Rich Forever" is a mixtape that plays like an album, with blaring, heraldic production by the likes of -Boi-1da and up-and-comer Beat Billionaire, plus guest appearances by Drake, Nas and Diddy.
Themewise, "Rich Forever" is business as usual -- which is to say, all business. Ross remains monomaniacally focused on monetary matters, spinning punch line after punch line about luxury cars, dripping jewels and high-grade cocaine.
Finest zinger: "I got them keys in the crib/You wouldn't find 'em if you had the keys to the crib." Best line about multitasking: "Fornicating/Counting money with a f*** face."
