Police in New York have arrested a man in connection with a weekend shooting at a Brooklyn house party that left nine people hospitalized.
Tyrone Brown, 24, was charged with attempted murder, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and reckless endangerment, police said Tuesday.
The shooting started early Sunday in the East Flatbush neighborhood, police said. A neighbor told CNN affiliate WCBS that she heard gunshots.
Four men and five women, all younger than 45, were injured and taken to four hospitals.
The injuries were not life-threatening, New York Police Department Officer Sophia Tassy-Mason said.
The neighborhood at East 52nd Street is a mix of residential and commercial buildings, she said. According to NYPD statistics, there have been 21 shooting incidents reported in the area this year.
