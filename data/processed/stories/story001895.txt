(EW.com) -- The 2012-13 TV season is already a month old and, as expected, returning favorites have remained just that â€” favorites. Naturally, this year's best comedy winner at the Emmys remains in the Top 5 (way to go, Cam!), while Shonda Rhimes' trusty medical drama is still fighting the good fight for ABC.
But how are all those new shows faring opposite the veterans through the first four weeks? Here's the top (and low) rated dramas through Oct. 21 and what they are averaging in the uber-important adults 18-49 demographic. (New shows are bolded and cancelled ones are crossed out). Remember, each ratings point equals 1.3 million viewers.
