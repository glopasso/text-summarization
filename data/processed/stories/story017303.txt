If you're the kind of person who's happiest spending your two weeks off helping to look after elephants in Thailand or working for free on an organic farm in New Zealand, then perhaps you've been on a volunteer vacation.
More people than ever before are going on volunteer vacations, also known as "voluntourism," and if you've had an inspiring experience helping others while on holiday we'd like you to upload images and video of your experience to CNN iReport.
We'll use the best images and video on CNN.com and those of you with particularly compelling stories could be featured in an article.
