The boyfriend of "Glee" star Becca Tobin, Matt Bendik, was found dead in a Philadelphia hotel room, the actress' manager confirmed to CNN.
"Matt has passed away. With respect to both the Bendik and Tobin families, there is no comment at this time," manager Ricky Rollins told CNN Friday.
Philadelphia police said the 31-year-old was found dead inside Hotel Monaco Thursday shortly after 1 p.m. ET. There appeared to be no foul play involved.
"Housekeeping discovered this guest in the hotel room in the bed unresponsive," Officer Christine O'Brien said.
"No cause of death has been determined," O'Brien said.
Tobin, 28, plays snippy cheerleader Kitty Wilde on the Fox musical show. Tobin joined the cast of "Glee" in the series' fourth season.
This is not the first tragedy to strike the show's cast. Actor Cory Monteith, who portrayed heartthrob Finn Hudson, was found dead in a Vancouver hotel room on July 13, 2013. Monteith was also 31 years old.
At the time of his death, Monteith was dating "Glee" co-star Lea Michele, who plays Rachel on the show.
