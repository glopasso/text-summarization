Real Madrid have reduced Barcelona's lead at the top of the Spanish Primera Liga to three points after coming from behind to win 2-1 at Almeria on Thursday.
Madrid, looking to bounce back following their defeat in "El Clasico", suffered a poor start and fell behind in the 14th minute.
Kalu Uche broke down the right and his low cross was met by the unmarked Albert Crusat at the far post.
And the home side nearly doubled their advantage just seven minutes later when Domingo Cisma's free-kick was superbly saved by Iker Casillas.
However, the visitors drew level in the 27th minute thanks to a moment of superb skill from Cristiano Ronaldo.
The $125 million man burst past two defenders, fooled a third with one of his trademark stepovers and fird home a shot into the far corner for his 19th league goal of the season.
From then on, Real were the better side. Veteran midfielder Guti struck the post from the edge of the area before Rafael Van der Vaart put the rebound wide.
And the winning goal came in the 69th minute when Van der Vaart collected Gonzalo Higuain's pass before firing home a low shot into the bottom corner.
Madrid should have added to their lead, but Ronaldo was denied by goalkeeper Diego Alves while Karim Benzema and Mahamadou Diarra also missed good chances.
