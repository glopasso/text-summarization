A 100 meter boat with a full tropical garden is not something you're likely to see very often. In fact, before now, you've probably never seen it.
Wally Island: The vessel that has all the comforts of home
However, the giant mega-yacht 'Wally Island' offers exactly that.
Designed by super-yacht designers Wally is still in the design stage as the company has not yet managed to sell the concept to a buyer.
The vessel boasts over 1000 square meters in forward deck space, allowing for such features as a full garden and pool, a tennis court, or several heli-pads.

The designers intended to offer the owner the opportunity to live completely independently on the vessel.
The boat, the designers said, could make life just like at home on a personal estate for its owner.
Although the interior spaces are pushed towards the aft of the vessel, there is still room for an owners suite and six further double-king sized suites. In addition to this there are numerous rooms for entertaining guests.
