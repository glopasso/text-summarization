Conflict between Tamil Tigers and government has lasted more than 25 years.
At least 65,000 killed, thousands homeless, 100,000-plus fled to south India.
Tigers have their roots in the earliest days of Sri Lanka's independence in 1948.
The group has demanded a separate Tamil state in northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
