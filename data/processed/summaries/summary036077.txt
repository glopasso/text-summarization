Authorities in the Indian city of Malegaon have asked residents to take a 'mugshot' of their cattle.
Cows are revered by the majority Hindu population, and many parts of the country have laws banning the slaughter of cattle.
Officials in Malegaon believe this is the best way to solve cow slaughter cases and enforce the law.
