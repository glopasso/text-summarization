New documentary captures glacial ice retreating at sixteen different locations around the world.
"Chasing Ice," by U.S. photographer James Balog, recorded glacier melt since 2007.
Balog's cameras have captured nearly one million images for the project.
Balog hopes film will "shift public perceptions by telling people a story that is real and happening now".
