15 buffalo are shot on Friday after escaping the day before from a farm in Schodack, New York.
Police helicopters fly overhead and nearby schools put on alert in the final moments of the chase.
The herd breaks through three layers of barbed wire fencing and crosses the Hudson River during the escape.
