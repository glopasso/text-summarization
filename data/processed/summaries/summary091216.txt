Peter Moskos: Reserve cop, 73, meant to use a Taser on a man, but shot him dead instead. Why was a volunteer cop witha  gun in a violent crimes unit?.
He says the man may have bought his way in with donations to police. Cops are, and should be, wary of those a little too eager to be police.
Moskos: Right approach is unarmed auxiliary cops, like in NYC, volunteering as a way to connect public to police.
