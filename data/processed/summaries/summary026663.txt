Sylvia Adcock says there have been previous flights that vanished and were never found.
Adcock: When a plane goes down in a remote area with no witnesses, radar is crucial tool.
Adcock: It's nearly impossible to crisscross such a large area in low-flying planes and boats.
She says radar won't work without transponders: Did they malfunction? Did plane land?.
