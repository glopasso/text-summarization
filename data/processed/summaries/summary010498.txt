NEW: Lawyer says he will appeal the sentences given to 5 convicted over the cruise disaster.
The sentences for the 5 defendants range from two years and 10 months to 18 months.
The trial of co-defendant Capt. Francesco Schettino began this week.
32 people died in January 2012 when the cruise liner ran aground and turned on its side.
