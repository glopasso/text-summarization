Winston's lawyer: Kinsman's "false accusations have already been exposed and rejected six times".
Erica Kinsman said Jameis Winston raped her in 2012; a prosecutor declined to bring criminal charges.
Her lawsuit alleges sexual battery and false imprisonment; Winston has said they had consensual sex.
