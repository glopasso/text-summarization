Michael Oren: While U.S. focused on mediation in Middle East, Russia acted in Crimea.
He says Russia has influence with Syria and relations with Iran could upend strategy on nukes.
Russia has played its cards well, while U.S. risks being outmaneuvered, he says.
Oren: U.S. should reassert itself in the Middle East and move to protect its allies.
