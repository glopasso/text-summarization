More than 1,400 people sign a petition asking Disney to make a pangolin movie.
John Sutter recently featured the pangolin as part of his Change the List project.
The relatively unknown creature is thought to be the most trafficked mammal in the world.
Sutter says celebrity could help save the pangolin; few care about the illegal trade.
