A 4-year-old boy is the latest victim of a man-eating leopard, a local police chief says.
He suspects one leopard is behind the deaths of 15 people in the past 15 months.
A reward has been offered to anyone who captures or kills the man-eating creature.
Leopards are common in low mountain areas of Nepal but usually eat wild prey like deer.
