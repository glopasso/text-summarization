NEW: Discovering there is data on the recorders is "excellent news," investigators say.
All the information on the flight data recorder is recovered, as are cockpit conversations.
The data recorders were pulled up from the bottom of the Atlantic nearly two years after the crash.
Air France 447 went down in June 2009, killing all 228 people aboard.
