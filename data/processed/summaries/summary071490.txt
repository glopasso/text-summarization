Natalie Westling, 17, is being called fashion's new "it girl" model and "one to watch".
Westling is walking in London Fashion Week this week; she walked in New York as well.
New York legislature now classifies models under 18 as child performers.
Westling dyed her hair red for the Marc Jacobs spring 2014 ad campaign.
