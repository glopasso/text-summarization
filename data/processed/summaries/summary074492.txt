Reserve deputy Robert Bates said he meant to use a Taser but accidentally shot and killed a man.
Lawyer for slain man's family says Bates wasn't qualified to be on the force and received preferential treatment.
"Robert Bates has met all the requisite training required by Oklahoma to be a reserve deputy," Bates' lawyer says.
