Two-time major champion John Daly cards the worst round of his top-level golf career.
The 47-year-old signs for 19-over-par 90 at a PGA Tour event in Florida.
Daly says he needs help to cure his putting "yips" after shooting 12 at one hole.
He also hit three balls into the pond at the 16th and then shanked an iron.
