A 1.4 km long subway tunnel is being constructed under Istanbul's Bosphorus Strait.
Operation uncovered the lost 4th century AD Byzantine port of Theodosius.
Thirty-four 1000-year-old ships have been excavated as well as remains of the port.
Discovery has delayed tunnel project by at least four years costing millions of dollars.
