John Avlon: A new CNN poll shows a reversal in the character of two major parties.
Avlon: Traditionally, GOP coalesce around a front-runner; Democrats root for newcomers.
Now, GOP has an eclectic pool of presidential candidates; Democrats have Hillary Clinton.
Avlon: If Clinton does not run, Democrats will have almost no strong candidate.
