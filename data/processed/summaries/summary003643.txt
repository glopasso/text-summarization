Former Columbine student Katie Lyles bears hidden scars from the day of the massacre.
Lyles, who is a teacher, says Columbine students lost their innocence that day.
It was a shock when her student asked if lockdown drills were for when a gunman came.
Lyles: Our kids deserve more mental health resources, enhanced security without guns.
