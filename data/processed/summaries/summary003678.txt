North Korea says it carried out an underground nuclear test Tuesday.
It is the third nuclear test Pyongyang has carried out since 2006.
It comes after new U.N. sanctions for North Korea's December satellite launch.
Experts say it's unknown how close the North is to being able to launch a nuclear warhead.
