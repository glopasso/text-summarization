Breweries and bars are giving patrons an easy way to give back, just by buying beer.
Sweetwater's 'Second Helping' has sold out all around Atlanta.
Proceeds from the beer go to benefit non-profit 'The Giving Kitchen'.
Other beer-based charities benefit farmers, the hungry, clean water and a rotating cast of beneficiaries.
