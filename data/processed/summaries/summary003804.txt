Sotomayor upheld Obamacare last year, now she's in the spotlight again in another appeal.
She issued stay to give Denver nuns reprieve on providing birth control to workers.
"She just placed a single case on hold. She did not overturn Obamacare," analyst says.
Sotomayor got the case because the nuns live in Denver, a town in her "region".
