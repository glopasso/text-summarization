New solar array will be largest on a bridge anywhere in the world, say developers.
Blackfriars Railway Bridge in central London will carry 4,400 photovoltaic solar cells on roof.
PV panels will create 900,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, generating 50% of new station's power.
New station due for completion in 2012.
