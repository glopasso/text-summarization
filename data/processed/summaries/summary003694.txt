The bodies are thought to be those of soldiers, a Ministry of Defense spokeswoman says.
They are believed to have been killed after Mali's March 2012 coup.
Investigators will seek to identify the men as they are removed from the mass grave.
Coup leader Amadou Sanogo has been arrested, accused of complicity in kidnapping.
