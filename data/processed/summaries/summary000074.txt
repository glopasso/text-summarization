Sebastien de la Cruz, 11, sang the national anthem at NBA finals on Tuesday.
Racists comments spread via Twitter after the Mexican-American boy's performance.
Sebastien stands resilient: "I'm a proud American and live in a free country. It's not hurting me.".
Father says he isn't "taken the comments personally, can't satisfy everyone".
