Minister to gun manufacturer: Stop using Michelangelo's David statue in ad.
The ad shows David holding an AR-501A1 rifle and the words "A Work of Art".
Museum officials say David's image is copyrighted to Italy, state news says.
ArmaLite's ad has been out since at least last May, but just got Italy's attention.
