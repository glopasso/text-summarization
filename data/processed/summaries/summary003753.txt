Kelly Kultala for Congress campaign releases an ad with folks seemingly naked.
The people were not nudists or actors; they were supporters of the campaign.
"It should also be noted that nobody was actually nude during filming," says campaign manager.
Kultala's opponent -- Rep. Kevin Yoder -- was reprimanded in 2012 for skinny dipping on a trip.
