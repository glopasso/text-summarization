The death of Burak Can Karamanoglu follows Tuesday death of Berkin Elvan, 15.
It is not clear which groups were involved in a fight that led to Karamanoglu's death.
Berkin died nine months after he was wounded, apparently by a police tear gas canister.
Berkin's father lashes out at Turkey's PM; Karamanoglu's father criticizes boy's mourners.
