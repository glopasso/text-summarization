Syria has said coalition strikes lack legitimacy but aim of striking ISIS is OK.
Majid Rafizadeh says in the short term, coalition strikes may help the Assad regime.
But he says the coalition strategy fails to take the wider conflict into account.
The conflict will continue to escalate and Syrian civilians will suffer, he says.
