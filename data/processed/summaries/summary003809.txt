The past year has seen a marked increase in attacks in Iraq, writes Arwa Damon.
Despite occasionally diffusing bombs, the government cannot stem the violence, she says.
July was the deadliest month in Iraq in the last five years.
According to the U.N., 1,057 Iraqis were killed and 2,326 wounded last month.
