In 2013, Anthony Stokes' family said a hospital refused him a heart due to his "history of noncompliance".
Hospital eventually gave Stokes a heart; on Tuesday he carjacked someone, burglarized a home, police said.
Stokes shot at an elderly woman, hit a pedestrian with a stolen car and died in a police chase, authorities said.
