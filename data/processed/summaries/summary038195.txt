Ryan Dolezan was born with Down Syndrome, a heart defect, and other health problems.
Shortly after he was born, Ryan's mother, Linda, was diagnosed with breast cancer.
Just before Linda was to receive a double mastectomy, it was discovered that Baby Ryan had leukemia.
Linda and Ryan went through surgeries, chemotherapy and recovery together as a team.
Today, nearly two years later, both Linda and Ryan are doing great.
