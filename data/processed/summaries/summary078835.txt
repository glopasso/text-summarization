Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh is head of the largest natural gas initiative in the Middle East.
It produces two billion cubic feet of gas a day, equivalent to 350,000 barrels of oil.
Qatar has 14 percent of the world's natural gas supplies.
Al Sayegh: "the only limiting factor in this region is the ability to build it".
