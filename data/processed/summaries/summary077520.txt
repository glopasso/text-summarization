Aaron Miller: Abbas to meet with Obama, but he won't be able to deliver his side of peace deal.
He says Abbas backs off Palestinian negotiating points at his peril; Netanyahu won't yield.
He says fractious Palestinians impede any deal, plus Obama taken up by Ukraine, midterms.
Miller: Parties don't want to subvert Kerry process, but Abbas visit won't move needle.
