Born in 1965, DC-9s opened jet routes to small airports, spurring travel.
Delta, the last U.S. carrier flying DC-9s, officially retired its fleet on January 6.
Hugh Hefner had one; 2012 VP nominee Paul Ryan campaigned in one.
Delta's final five Series 50 DC-9s will be sold off, another will go to a museum.
