Liberia is one of the countries worst-hit by the West African Ebola outbreak.
Entire towns and villages have been placed into quarantine or abandoned by residents.
Health workers must ensure those who die of virus are buried safely, to avoid contamination.
"Running away from Ebola is not a solution -- we have to face it, fight it," says Alpha Tamba.
