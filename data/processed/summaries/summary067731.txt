Two-time Oscar-winner Catherine Martin co-produced epic film "Australia".
Her husband and collaborator of 16 years, Baz Luhrmann directed the film.
The film's logistical challenges included bad weather, equine flu and sheer scale.
Martin still found the time to design star Nicole Kidman's whimsical costumes.
