NEW: The retrial of former President Hosni Mubarak is adjourned until mid-August.
The retrial is being held for Mubarak and his sons, as well as a former minister and security aides.
Mubarak was forced from office in February 2011 following two weeks of mass street protests.
Mubarak was convicted last year but was granted a retrial after appealing his conviction.
