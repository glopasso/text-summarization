LZ Granderson: Rubio one of 22 male GOP senators to vote no on Violence Against Women Act.
Granderson: Just as Rubio was to show new face of GOP, he cast a vote that's the old face.
Rubio's reasons were absurd, he says, in light of a bill that really works to protect women.
Act's funding 17% less than in 2005, he says. How could a women-friendly GOP say no?.
