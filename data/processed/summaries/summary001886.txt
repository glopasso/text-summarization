Former TSA agent Daniel Boykin, 33, videotaped his female co-worker in the restroom, authorities say.
Authorities say they found 90 videos and 1,500 photos of the victim on Boykin's phone and computer.
Boykin worked in an administrative capacity and didn't do public security screenings, TSA official says.
