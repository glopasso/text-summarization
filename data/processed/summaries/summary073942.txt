Nicollette Sheridan returns to the witness stand Friday in her case against producer Marc Cherry.
Her lawyer asks Sheridan to show on him in full force how she says Marc Cherry hit her on "Desperate Housewives" set.
"It was shocking, humiliating, it was demeaning," she said..
It was "a light tap on the head" to demonstrate "physical humor," Cherry's lawyer says.
